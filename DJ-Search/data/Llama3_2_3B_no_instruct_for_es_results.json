I feel as if I don\u2019t, something bad will happen. It gets lonely here often. I get up from the couch and start to pace back and forth as I usually do. You might say it\u2019s sort of a habit of mine. I walk around my living room when I notice the mirror.\nIt kind of gives me an off feeling. It\u2019s a round, rusted mirror that has beautiful antique designs on it. As I pace closer to it I think I can hear muffled voices. The sounds gets louder when I pass it. I can\u2019t help being attracted to it and I turn back around and start to approach it again, seeing my reflection come into view as I get closer.\nI walk past it once again but I notice something this time. I stand in front of it and I wave my hand as the other side mimics me. My arm goes up at the same time the reflection does, and goes down in perfect unison. However when my head turns right, the other side turns the wrong way.\nI wait patiently and the mother appears in front of me, standing behind her. I look behind my own shoulder and see no one there. \u201cOkay what\u2019s the problem honey?\u201d Her mother asked. She begins to speak again as I move my lips with hers. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I think there is something wrong with our mirror.\u201d She said with concern evident in her tone.\nThe mother spoke again. \u201cOh you\u2019re just seeing things honey. There is nothing there, so stop worrying.\u201d Then the mother walked away. She eventually walked away as well. I stood there not saying anything. I was just staring into the mirror waiting for her to come once again. Like I said it gets lonely here."

Joan, Andrew and their cousin Carolyn had decided to stay in Joan\u2019s new room until the movers left.\n\u201cJust bring it in here and hang it on the wall.\u201d said Mrs. Smith, completely oblivious to the children.\nThe movers then brought in a large, ornate mirror and hung it on the wall opposite Joan\u2019s bed. As Joan stared at her new mirror, she thought she saw a shadowy figure behind her.\n\u201cDid you see that?\u201d she questioned. \u201cSee what?.\u201d her cousin and brother said.\nJoan just shook her head and turned away from the mirror. \"Never mind.\"\nA few days later Joan stood in front of the mirror, wary of what she will see.\nAt first there was nothing, but as she started to leave she saw something out of the corner of her eye.\nJoan turned with an air of bravery, and faced the mirror head on. In the mirror was a dark shadowy man standing behind her. Tremulous, she turned around, but no one was there.\nJoan was completely and utterly scared.\nHer brother quickly came and was soon standing in front of the mirror. Joan assumed that her brother would see the shadowy man too, but when she asked, Andrew said all he saw was himself.\n\u201cAre you ok \u2018cause you sound like you\u2019re suffering from a slight case of paranoia.\u201d said her brother as he left the room. Joan stood in front of the mirror and once again the shadowy man appeared behind her.\nJoan was not sure how to respond to what was going on.\nAfter several sleepless nights and the figure\u2019s constant asking to be freed, Joan finally snapped.\nShe pulled the mirror from the wall, letting it shatter to the floor. At the sound of the crash Joan\u2019s mother rushed in.\n\u201cJoan what have you done? Don\u2019t you realize that\u2019s seven years of bad luck?!\u201d Mrs. Smith screeched.\nA few weeks later Joan\u2019s mother bought her another mirror and hung it in her room. \u201cThat looks sublime! Try not to break this one.\u201d said her mother as she left the room.\nJoan sat for hours staring at the mirror, but thankfully saw nothing except her own reflection. The next day while Joan was doing her homework a cold feeling washed over her.\nShe looked up into the mirror and saw a cloudy shadow. When it cleared she saw the face of a woman who began laughing menacingly at her."

                            "text": "Heaven knows I upendo season 1 Regina, but the woman was definitely vain. I mean the very first thing she did when she woke up after her curse was cast was check her haircut lol. She seemed to have this overbearing need to look her sharpest. And to some degree I think she was fixated with it on the surface. I think a big part of this is that she really didn't have much else going for her at the time. She wasn't particularly likable to the people around her at the time so she put a lot of time into her apperance to make up for what many thought was an off putting personality. And naturally for this, we'd see her in the mirror a lot.\nAnother thing I've noticed that started in season 1 is that when she's angry au frustrated it's always the mirror that breaks.\nI attribute this to a certian kind of self-loathing. Espically in season 1. In the third image up I can imagine that she was angry with herself. Angry that she couldn't seem to keep her plans from falling apart. And in the above two picha she's angry with herself for not being able to keep Robin.\nIn the above scene I don\u2019t think she was just staring at the Queen like that. I think that there was a part of Regina that was looking at even the good half of herself with that kind of sadness/anger.And then she kind of just aggressively covers the mirror. Her expression alone as she stares at herself makes me think that she feels overpowering guilt and a degree of unhappiness towards herself. As mentioned above, for me the breaking au covering of a mirror in a TV onyesha has always been symbolic of a character expressing anger/dislike of him/herself. Similar to kicking one\u2019s shadow au swatting away a self-reflection in the water.\nAs I've mentioned a few makala zamani I feel like Regina harbors a lot of negative self-views.\nHowever I don't think that that's the only thing the mirrors symbolize. I think that one zaidi thing the mirrors symbolize for Regina is clarity. She's often seen with/by mirrors when she's making a discovery about herself au when she thinks about things. Many times when she hid herself away in her kuba we see her looking into a mirror.\nIn this image she had just Lost Henry and the trust of the people she had fought to earn forgiveness from due in part to her mother. This is the first we see of her after she poofs herself into hiding. In hiding she had a lot of time to think. About herself, about the situation, and about the changes in her life. And she did it in front of a mirror. An object that helps wewe see yourself for who wewe are, that helps wewe see other things for what they are.\nSimilarly in seasn 4 she retreats to her kuba for some alone time. Where she once again stands before the mirror. I think mirrors help her think.\nThere is one zaidi scene wherein I think mirrors helped us see into Regina's character. This scene takes place in the Enchanted Forest.\nIt is during An apple As Red As Blood, when Regina is sitting alone in the palace garden. In this scene Regina talked of an apple mti as a symbol of herself; but it wasn't the only one present. In this scene Sidney presents her with a gift. That gift was a mirror of all things, so she could \"see herself the way he (Sidney) saw her, as the fairest in the land.\"\nYet again, the mirror is presented to her as a means to see herself in a different way. au to see herself zaidi clearly.\nAnd in the most hivi karibuni episode Regina and Emma get trapped in a world of mirrors. The initial plan was for the pair to trap the Evil Queen in that world. But what ended up taking place was the duo being transported there.\nSo now Regina is literally surrounded kwa mirrors and is forced to see herself. And she seemed far zaidi snappy than usual. The crazy thing is that it is in this episode where she makes a pretty huge confession. She states that she is afraid to raise Henry alone and realizes that she could have been an awful mother. Naturally she came to this discovery kwa watching her Evil Queen self interact with Henry through the mirror.\nThese are just a few examples of Regina's experiences with mirrors. And I have a feeling that zaidi are to come in this new season."

It's opening the door--oh--no! God no! NO!\nFarah couldn't close her eyes that night. The thought of being alone in the wretched home haunted her mind and her memories. It seemed almost cliche at the sound of the rain and thunder that something horrific would happen. It seemed almost cliche that the doors in her home were being knocked on and shut on their own. It seemed almost cliche that she was being stalked; and she knew it too.\nShe liked to call it 'The Doctor', though it had no name at her current recognition. It was in her home, though, watching her while she slept. Farah suffered extreme paranoia and hysteria from the day's events. Though, she couldn't help but wonder what had exactly happened within a time span of two hours.\nShe only knew one thing that could have summoned the demon into her life. She went to the hospital to visit one of her friends who had recently been through a car accident. After recovering, Farah congratulated her friend on her success and ability to walk again. She had left the hospital room when the fire began.\nFlames had burst out everywhere from a gas leak in the floor below. The first floor of the hospital was where her dearest friend was located; the emergency ward. The fire spread to a conflagration on the upper floors. Farah managed to escape with her friend, though she had experienced a problem.\nShe had ran straight into one of the nurses and knocked her back into the flame. She found out that she herself had survived and was transported to another hospital around the block, and was in turn treated for severe burns. The treatment couldn't heal a scorched heart, however, and the nurse died an awful death.\nIt was the next day that she noticed something was wrong in her home. Doors would open and shut, her radio would turn on and off, and she would see hideous reflections in her mirror. She had heard of a trick known as Mirror Gazing to contact the dead in a haunting. She had lit several candles and gathered around a mirror, and began her experiment.\n\"If the dead wish for contact, send them through now!\" she chanted to the mirror. Within moments, she was granted her wish. A being of a bandaged up face emerged from the mirror. She saw it inside, staring back and copying her movements. It had bloodied bandages covering its face, and bandaged hands and feet. In the right hand it carried a small lighter. The chest of the creature was covered up by a green and burned hospital gown.\nShe could tell it was female by the random strands of blonde and curly hairs spurting from her head bandages, and remembered the nurse having the same type of follicles.\nThe candles burned out in seconds as the creature stuck its hand through the window and grabbed the side of the wall. Farah jumped back, wincing. It crawled from the mirror one limb at a time, staring at Farah while still menacingly exiting the mirror. Farah screamed and ran for her front door, but no matter how hard she tried it would not open.\nThe window would not break. She couldn't escape her home no matter how hard she tried. She turned from trying to bash in the window, and saw it sneaking towards her. She heard grunting and giggling coming from its direction, and ran off to a staircase near her foyer. She dashed upstairs and raced into her room, where she shut and locked her door and hid away in the closet. She looked through the slits in the door and saw and heard nothing.\nSilence filled the room as she stepped out of the closet cell. She saw nothing and heard nothing until she opened the door. Expecting something to be waiting for her, nothing was there but an empty hallway. It was gone. She backed into the room and looked over to the closet. The door was shut.\nShe went into the bathroom and shut the door behind her. She splashed her face in the sink beneath her and lifted her head up to the bathroom mirror. Her reflection slowly shifted into something else; the being. It shifted completely until eventually revealing the arm as it climbed out from the container again.\nFarah dived out of the room and hid back in her bedroom closet. The lights in her home went out, and the entire room was black. The door of the bedroom slowly shifted open, and the creature (again, known as the doctor) sneaks into the room. It flicks the lighter open and looks around, aiming at the closet.\nFarah panicked as the cretin maneuvered to the door and lifted the knob. It shifted open, and Farah screamed in horror. It seemed to smile as it tilted its head to the side, and proceeded to grab her neck and lift it into the air. It shoves its hand into her stomach and continues pressing until eventually penetrating her naval area. She is slammed down to the ground, gasping for breath as she slides across the floor to the front door.\nThe Doctor looks down and smirks as it shifts its body weight toward her, reaching down to grab her leg as she scoots off. Holding her stomach, Farah is forced to drag her weight with only one hand. Her leg is grabbed, and the doctor drags her to the back wall and slams her up against it. The Doctor slides away from her, looking for something to light on fire.\nFarah slides downward to her bed and reaches for a weapon. A pistol has been hidden under her bed for such an occasion for a robber or murderer--but not a demon. She lifts the pistol from the bed and aims at the doctor's head and fires. It turns around and tilts its head left. It collapses onto her bed, and Farah, still gripping her intestines to hold them inside, manages to scoot her way to the staircase. She fumbles down the stairs until meeting up with a desk and a telephone.\nShe lifts it up to call 911, and turns to the mirror she began the session of horror with. She saw her reflection again, and as the officer picked up, she saw it twist.\nAnd that's all the officer could achieve in spitting out until Farah was grabbed by the neck and drug to the mirror, where her neck was snapped and the mirror broken. The Doctor stared at her for a moment, and proceeded to drop the lighter to the floor.\nThe cops say the house fire went on for hours before dying out. The poor thing's house burned down when she fell on them."

The heady scent of the gardenias in Shanal\u2019s bridal bouquet, imported specifically at Burton\u2019s request, wafted up to fill her senses\u2014and left her feeling slightly suffocated.\nWas this what she really wanted above all things? She looked across to her groom. Burton Rogers, so handsome, so intelligent, so successful. So rich. He was a good guy, no, a great guy. And she liked him, she really did.\nLike. Such an insipid expression, really.\nWords she\u2019d spoken to her best friend, Ethan Masters, only a year ago, echoed in her mind. You have the chance to have the kind of forever love that many people can only dream of. I envy you that because that\u2019s the kind of love I want from the man I marry, if I ever marry. And you can be certain I\u2019m not prepared to settle for less than that, ever.\nThey\u2019d been brave words, spoken before her world had begun to crumble around her. Before she\u2019d chosen to sacrifice the chance to find true love. Before she\u2019d latched onto the opportunity to give her parents a secure retirement after their lives had been torn apart.\nWas Burton her forever love? No. Was she settling for less? Most definitely.\nEveryone in the lab at the viticulture research center had said it had been a lucky day for her when she\u2019d caught Burton\u2019s attention. They\u2019d teased her about finding love in their clinical environment and she guessed, on the face of things, they had a point. As her boss, Burton had a reputation for expecting excellence in everything around him. Clearly, she had fallen within that category. And on the face of it, she\u2019d agreed about how fortunate she was\u2014faking joy amongst her colleagues when he\u2019d proposed marriage and offered to solve her problems. She\u2019d convinced everyone around her until she\u2019d nearly believed herself that her engagement had made her the luckiest woman in the world.\nEveryone gathered here in the cathedral believed this to be the happiest day of her life. Everyone except the one person who\u2019d tried to talk her out of it. She flicked a glance sideways, but she couldn\u2019t spot Raif Masters, Ethan\u2019s cousin, in the crowd of two hundred guests jammed into the pews. She knew he was here, though. From the moment she\u2019d walked down the aisle, accompanied by both her parents\u2014her father in his wheelchair, on a rare appearance in public\u2014she\u2019d felt the simmering awareness that she felt only in Raif\u2019s presence.\nA buzzing sound began to build in Shanal\u2019s ears and her chest grew tight. A tremor in her hands made the heavy bouquet quiver\u2014releasing another burst of cloying scent.\nSilence stretched out in the cathedral\u2014silence filled with the ever increasing buzz in her ears and the erratic pounding of her heart.\nIt was a very long time.\n\u201cI do,\u201d Shanal said, her voice shaking, unsure.\nShe dropped her bouquet, unheeding now of the scent of the flowers as they fell heavily on the carpeted altar, and worked her three-carat, princess-cut diamond engagement ring from her finger. A princess for his princess, Burton had said when he\u2019d slid it on her hand\u2014its fit perfect, of course."

low-burning fire, golden eyes swirling as he thought quickly.\nIn 2005, a biotech firm called Syngenta produced a similar rice it called \"Golden Rice 2.\"\nTheir aim, he said, was nothing less than \"the lifting, from the backs and from the hearts of men, of their burden of arms and of fears, so that they may find before them a golden age of freedom and of peace.\"\nHis skin was golden, his wide back muscled, lean and defined down to the slender hips and waist.\nThe headlights of a slow moving car washed her white body, shadowing the curve of her buttocks, the roundness of her shoulder, painting her golden hair in its light.\nBut more important\u00adly, whatever he was driving, we don't know if he parked it down here at the start of the tour or up in Golden, Colorado where the tour ends.\nThere was anger in his sharp voice this time, and his golden eyes flashed.\nBeside the ring was a man the size of Xander with blond hair and golden eyes and skin.\nThe king moved uneasily on his golden throne.\nIts reawakening of the arts derived chiefly from seeking to recapture something thought lost from a past Golden Age.\nSo while such an attack and its aftermath would not derail our eventual arrival at the next golden age, it quite possibly would delay it.\nHaving said all of that, government should certainly be watched with a suspicious eye, for it could conceivably delay or

golden eyes blazed like two candles.\nShe could see him sitting on a golden throne or commanding legions of soldiers.\nHis golden eyes were calm, his large frame relaxed with the feline grace that

bedded down in a quiet motel in Golden, Colorado, after a shared ride from the Denver airport.\nDustin ran up to the young man Jenn assumed was his master, and the golden eyes at once told her who this Damian was.\nThe youth with the golden eyes sat back and looked around, appearing overwhelmed.\n\"It won't happen,\" Damian said firmly, golden eyes flashing.\nDarian's golden eyes pulsed and swirled with battle fever.\nHe looked as tired as she felt, his hair disheveled and dark circles beneath his blazing golden eyes.\nHis eyes, so light in color they were more golden than brown, penetrated her thoughts with every look.\nHis golden eyes were more intense than the midday sun.\nThe White God, Damian, was cool and wary, his white-blonde hair, golden eyes and subtle white glow the opposite of Xander's darker presence.\nThis threefold division of the office of imperial archchancellor was acknowledged in 1356 by the Golden Bull of the emperor Charles IV., but the duties of the office were performed by the elector of Mainz.\nBut it held a beautiful golden tripod that was worth more than a thousand fishes.\nSo, with his own hands he carried the golden tripod to the little house where Thales lived.\nWhen he heard that some men had come to Corinth with a very costly golden tripod, he had them brought before him.\nThe messengers made due haste to carry the golden prize to

                            "text": "It is now exactly a week since Mum passed away [5 September]. Mum had been ill with cancer for some time, and in hospital for several months. Dad, my sister and I were with her for five hours, from 830 AM to 1330, when she left us. Strangely, while we were with her, she actually predicted how long she was going to last! It was as though \u2018someone\u2019 had \u2018told\u2019 her\u2026.\nI now feel ready to impart what I \u2018saw\u2019 during that time. Neither my father nor sister \u2018witnessed\u2019 anything unusual. But my sister later said she did \u201csense things happening\u201d.\nWhen we arrived the curtain was drawn back around Mum\u2019s bed. She lay there with her head inclined to the right. Her gaze seemed unfocused, yet she was aware of our presence. As one of the first things she asked was for the curtain to be drawn round, but with a gap left.\nUp until the final hour or so she did speak, and her words came out in short bursts, apparently unconnected to each other. Dad thought she was just incoherently rambling, but I had other thoughts.\nAt times she was clearly either reminiscing about the happier times of her life [childhood, her wedding, etc]. Or directly addressing \u2018beings\u2019 that were \u2018visible\u2019 to her, not with the naked eye. She mentioned \u201cdeath\u201d, not, it seems, as in the physical state, but the entity. But more on that later.\nMost tellingly she mentioned a \u201cdoor\u201d. The one I saw was set into a stone wall, with a cobbled path leading up to it. Beyond the portal was darkness. It was through this that Death [as the Archangel Azrael] entered, accompanied by a rush of ice cold air, and the brief, faint sound of a bell. He was very distinctive. Tall, with a dark foot-length robe. The hood was drawn back, revealing a gaunt grey face, set with piercing dark eyes, and framed by long snow-white hair. He carried a long black-handled sword with a transparent blade.\nDeath/Azrael was present throughout. I felt the air grow perceptibly colder when he stood near me. My sister felt the same. He even, at one or two points, when I was holding Mum\u2019s hand, placed his hand on ours! Creepy\u2026 .\nAlso there were my \u2018guardians\u2019 - Nathaniel and Varunha. And Mum\u2019s guardian angel, Advachiel. Nathaniel is an angel, with raven-coloured hair, wings, and robe, pale skin, and grey or violet eyes. His sword too had a black handle, but the blade was bluey-silver. Varunha is a complete contrast: Golden hair, a rosy complexion, and deep blue eyes, with a white gold robe, and pale blue wings. Advachiel has a pale green robe, white wings, red-gold hair, and pale brown eyes.\nMy guardians I\u2019d \u2018met\u2019 many times before. Mainly through dreams. Regarding Mum\u2019s guardian angel, although I\u2019d suspected his existence on previous hospital visits, but only \u2018met\u2019 him, for the first time, the previous day [4 September]. This was during meditations on an Angelology course. His name had been \u2018revealed\u2019, in a dream of 3-4 September.\nAt times, during those 5 hours, Nathaniel, Varunha, and Advachiel seemed to be fighting Death/Azrael to gain Mum more time with us. When things became to fraught Archangel Michael even intervened! I\u2019d \u2018met\u2019 him before, through meditations and dreams. He was golden haired and blue eyed, with white wings, and a deep blue robe. He carried a gold-handled sword. Michael, as he had in the Angelology course, placed \u2018protective shields\u2019 around people [here it was Mum and I]. Faced with these \u2018shields\u2018, and with angelic opposition, Death/Azrael was held off for a while. But, the outcome was never going to be in doubt. As Mum faded away, he would prevail. When the time came, Death/Azrael pulled up his hood, and drew his sword. As he delivered the coup de grace, I saw Mum\u2019s soul leave her body.\nA few hours earlier Mum had said she would \u201clike to have daisies in heaven\u201d. I turned to find that, beyond the \u2018door\u2019 was a beautiful sunlit meadow with daisies, poppies, etc ! It was into this peaceful place that Mum\u2019s \u2018departing spirit\u2019 was led, by Advachiel.\nVery sorry to hear of your Mums passing Alex. Any death is a sad loss. Both my parents have passed away and I wish I could draw comfort from knowing there was another place they had gone to. I'm glad to hear that your mum was taken to the place she wanted to go to."

Their hair gleamed golden in the sunshine, lovely to behold; but the real sunshine was more beautiful still. It shone redder, clearer through the dark trees, when the sun went down. It was lovely thus to look at the sunshine of heaven. And she looked at the red sun, and she thought about it so deeply, and thought of the little one whom the stork was to bring, and the wife of the drummer was very cheerful, and looked and looked, and wished that the child might have a gleam of sunshine given to it, so that it might at least become like one of the shining angels over the altar.\nchurch to behold, with hair like gold\u2014the gleam of the setting sun was upon it.\nAnd the town repeated what the Fire-drum had said.\nPeter.

The little drummer still kept his healthy color; he had suffered no damage; he looked cheerfully at the dog of the regiment, which was jumping along as merrily as if the whole thing had been got up for his amusement, and as if the bullets were only flying about that he might have a game of play with them.\nthough they might have done so, and perhaps there would have been much sense in it; and now at last the word \u201cRetire\u201d was given; but our little drummer beat \u201cForward! march!\u201d for he had understood the command thus, and the soldiers obeyed the sound of the drum.

He was as brown as a wild man, and his eyes were bright, and his face beamed like sunshine. And his mother held him in her arms; she kissed his lips, his forehead, and his red hair. She had her boy back again; he had not a silver cross on his breast, as his father had dreamt, but he had sound limbs, a thing the mother had not dreamt. And what a rejoicing was there!

She reddened from brow to neck, and answered not a single word; and then strangers came into the room, and one of them was the state councillor\u2019s son.

                            "text": "For this week's 52 Weeks of Fairy Tale post I have chosen the very well known fairy tale- Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. This was an especially fun tale to craft for, I have been looking forward to making all seven dwarfs as well as Snow White. Last week my back was not in a crafting mood, so I was delayed in getting started, I was very happy to finally finish up today.\nOnce there was a queen, who sat in her window sewing, she pricked her finger and a few drops of blood fell on her snow covered, ebony window sill. The queen sees this, and wishes for a beautiful daughter who has skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, and hair as black as her ebony window frame. Not long after the Queen gives birth to a beautiful baby girl who has skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, and ebony black hair. Sadly however, the Queen passes away.\nThe King is remarried to a beautiful, but vain woman. The new queen has a magic mirror, to which she asks the well known question. \"Mirror, Mirror, on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?\" to which the mirror always replies \" You, my queen, are fairest of all.\" The years go by, and Snow White grows up into a very beautiful young women. The queen, as usual, poses her question to the mirror \" Mirror, Mirror, on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?\" this time the mirror answers \"You, my queen, are fair; it is true. But Snow White is a thousand times fairer than you.\" The queen is furious and becomes full of hatred toward Snow White.\nThe Queen orders a huntsman to take Snow White out into the woods and kill her, and as proof to bring back her lungs and liver ( in other versions it is the heart). The huntsman, upon seeing Snow White's beauty, falls in love with her, and cannot kill her, he tells Snow White to run away and hide from the evil queen. The huntsman kills a boar (in some versions a deer) and brings its lungs and liver to the queen. However when the queen again questions her mirror, and it still answers that Snow White is the prettiest, the Queen knows she has been tricked.\nMeanwhile, Snow White comes upon a small house in the woods, it is the home of seven dwarfs.\nThe seven Dwarfs agree to let Snow White live with them, in exchange for her cooking and cleaning.\nThe Queen learns that Snow White is alive and living in the woods, and devises and evil plan to kill Snow White. One day the dwarfs left to work in the mine, and warned Snow White to not let anyone inside. The Queen however has disguised herself as a kind old peddler woman, and when the dwarfs leave, she is able to trick Snow White into buying a lace up bodice. The Queen in disguise ties the bodice laces too tight on Snow White and Snow White faints dead. The Queen is happy and returns home. Luckily the dwarfs return in time to help Snow White, and when they loosen the laces, she can breath again, and comes back to life.\nThe Queen again learns that Snow White is alive after hearing from her mirror that Snow White is still the fairest. Again the queen disguises herself as another kind looking women, who after the dwarfs leave, is able to trick Snow White into letting her comb her hair with a poison comb. Snow White collapses again, with the poison comb still in her hair. The Queen returns home, and luckily the dwarfs come home in time to save Snow White who is revived when they remove the poison comb.\nThe queen is furious when she learns Snow White is still alive, and comes up with another evil plan, this time creating a poisonous apple. When the Queen returns in disguise to Snow White, the queen offers her the apple. This time Snow White is more hesitant, so the queen, who has made only the red half of the apple poison, offers to eat the whiter half of the apple to prove to Snow White that the apple is not poison. Snow White is then tricked into taking a bite of the poison apple, at which time she falls down dead.\nThis time the dwarfs do not arrive home in time, and are unable to save their beloved Snow White. They build her a glass coffin, as Snow White still looks as beautiful as when she was alive, and looked as if she was only asleep. Some time passed, and a Prince happened upon the Dwarf's cottage, he saw Snow White in her glass coffin, and fell in love with her. He begged the dwarfs to let him have her, as he loved her so much. The Dwarfs could see how the prince loved Snow White, so eventually they decided to let the Prince keep Snow White in her glass coffin.\nAs the Prince's servants are carrying her away they stumble upon a root and Snow White is jostled, which causes the piece of poisoned apple to dislodge from her throat, and she wakes up, alive again. (Of course in later versions, it is a kiss from the Prince that brings her back to life) Everyone is very happy, and the Prince proposes to her right then. The happy couple are married.\nThe Queen once again asks her mirror who is the fairest- this time the mirror answers \"You, my queen, are fair; it is true. But the Young Queen is a thousand times fairer than you.\"\nThe Queen was very angry, and eventually decided to go see who this young queen was, when she went to the wedding, she recognized Snow White right away. As punishment the Queen was captured, and forced to wear red hot iron shoes, and she danced herself to death.\nSnow White and her Prince lived happily ever after.\nI remember reading this version as a child, it has been quite some time since I have seen the Disney version, which I also remember enjoying as a child.\nI had quite a fun time crafting Snow White and the seven dwarfs- Originally I was going to sew a wire framed Snow White doll, but I realized I didn't have black doll hair, so then I started needle felting Snow White. I love how needle felting is almost like modeling from clay, each project takes on a life of its own.\nI gave Snow White a red apple, her dress is trimmed in yellow.\nI tied her hair with blue embroidery floss, and gave her a nice long braid.\nEach dwarf turned out a different size, I decided on a simple shape, and gave them each a different colored outfit, and various beards.\nThis project was quite a lot of fun needle felting and took a couple of days and quite a few hours to complete. I loved working with all of the different wool roving colors. Needle felting is one of my favorite crafts, and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys fiber arts projects.\nTomorrow, in order to catch back up with my fairy tale posts, I will be sharing another Grimm's story with a very similar name- Snow White and Rose Red. While researching Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, I kept coming across this Grimm's tale, which is a completely different character and story, so I thought I would share it for Week #16.\nAmazing handwork! What do you do with all of your fairy tale materials when you move on to the next story? Do you put them in storage or leave them out?\nYou little needle felt projects are so cute April! I wonder what those Brothers Grimm were like in real life. They certainly thought up some bizarre things didn't they? Glass coffins and death by dancing. I'm really enjoying learning the non-Disney versions of these tales. Thank you!\nOooh, I love all of your dwarves, but seriously...that orangy one with the long beard...oh, he is fantastic!\nOh, April!! They are beautiful!!\nThanks everyone for you kind comments! I really enjoy needle felting and had a lot of fun with this project.\nHope everyone is having a nice Friday, I am looking forward to the sunshine that has been forecast for the weekend!\nIt's been a long time since I read that version. As a little girl, I had the Grimm book that I would read. Your felted creation is beautiful and they are the perfect compliment to the story. I'm so glad that you have linked in to share your felting and stories.\nOh my goodness.. Your characters are too cute!! Thanks for sharing another great fairytale post with us at Sharing Saturday.\nwow. the time and skill that went into these is amazing! thanks so much for sharing with us at tip-toe thru tuesday! hope to see you again this week!"

                            "text": "Critic's Notebook: 'A Wrinkle in Time' Isn't a Great Film, But Why Does It Have to Be?\nAva DuVernay's film was destined to disappoint, given the outrageously high bar set for female and minority directors.\nDisney marketed A Wrinkle in Time to theatergoers like no other film in recent memory. I went to the movies about once a week in the past month (I'm talking civilian screenings, not ad-free press previews), and each time, I saw a Wrinkle trailer with director Ava DuVernay in close-up, telling the audience what making her fantasy children's adaptation meant to her. DuVernay, whose last two films (the MLK bio Selma and the mass-incarceration doc 13th) racked up three Oscar nods in as many years, thus became the face of Wrinkle, despite more recognizable castmembers like Reese Witherspoon, Oprah Winfrey, Mindy Kaling and Chris Pine. (In contrast, you won't see Steven Spielberg's mug in the Ready Player One trailers.) DuVernay's central role in selling Wrinkle is a testament to her popularity as a spokesperson for inclusion in Hollywood.\nAs the first live-action $100 million project helmed by a woman of color, A Wrinkle in Time had to tell two feel-good stories: that of a biracial teen (played by Storm Reid) learning to love and trust herself, and that of female artists and artists of color triumphing in an industry that has traditionally disregarded their perspectives and contributions. But Wrinkle didn't deliver on either count. Mixed to negative reviews led to a disappointing $33 million opening weekend at the box office. With a 42 percent Rotten Tomatoes rating and a middling B CinemaScore, the film underwhelmed critics and adult audiences (kids gave it an A\u2013), weighed down as it was by a messy script with too many affirmational platitudes and not enough character development.\nI'll happily defend the (wildly ambitious, immensely personal) movie on its own merits. But first, it's important to note the ludicrously unfair burden that Wrinkle was saddled with as soon as DuVernay signed on and turned protagonist Meg into a biracial girl: It had to be both artistically dazzling and a commercial hit in order for it to be considered any kind of success. Grossly put, the \"system\" was rigged against it.\nThe culture wars today are such that individual productions are gauged as barometers of social values. The mega-successes of Black Panther and Wonder Woman have been widely analyzed, correctly, as evidence that audiences were starved for representation. Naturally, some are wondering this week if the corollary is true: Does the (relative) failure of A Wrinkle in Time mean that female audiences and moviegoers of color have had their fill? Is the centering of women of color too \"niche\" for mainstream viewers? The countless stories of female directors and filmmakers of color sent to \"movie jail\" after one creative misfire make these questions more than theoretical. Careers have been ended, or put on ice, for much less.\nIt seems pretty obvious that the answer to the questions above is an adamant \"no.\" Black Panther and Wonder Woman built on previous franchises and deliberately hewed to a crowd-pleasing formula (which is not meant as criticism, simply a matter of fact). DuVernay pursued a different vision; she intentionally eschewed a final battle scene, for example, that would've made Wrinkle conform more to other multiplex fare. Lone films can serve as a reflection of our collective desires. But it's foolhardy to see every film as a mirror, especially when each one is a product of not only its creators, but also its marketing strategies, larger cultural trends and what audiences have been conditioned to like. It's ridiculous to base the social \"value\" of girls and women of color's stories on one movie, and simply unjust to put that weight on one woman's shoulders.\nI want to note that a truly inclusive industry would give a pass to DuVernay as it has to so many white male directors (not that her career is now in any sort of trouble). Diversity that demands all people from marginalized groups never make a mistake is no diversity at all. It's also annoying that advocates of diversity are forced once again into a defensive posture, making a case for one of our own, when the problem has always been the scarcity of opportunities, not the merits of inclusion.\nI realize that the current argument for a more diverse entertainment landscape is largely predicated on black, brown, yellow, female and LGBTQ artists outperforming the straight white male average; their work has to be good, if not superlative. That kind of thinking has shaped much of the media response to films like Moonlight, Girls Trip, Get Out and Mudbound \u2014 that these films' excellence \"justifies\" diversity. But artists need the space to take risks, and sometimes those risks don't pay off. All I can say is that I hope the executives who wield greenlighting power look at auteurs of any background as fallible human beings, as well as visionaries.\nDuVernay certainly proves herself as such with Wrinkle. As a critic, I probably wouldn't indiscriminately recommend the film, but I appreciated that it was a planet-hopping movie with a girl of color at the center. I also admired the injection of the floridly supernatural into West Adams, a historically black neighborhood in Los Angeles (not far from where DuVernay grew up), and, of course, the beauty of the various extraterrestrial terrains, some of which brought me to tears. DuVernay certainly proved wrong naysayers who have dismissed her filmmaking talent in the past and attributed her meteoric rise to saying the right thing. A Wrinkle in Time is, arguably above all, a visual feast.\nSo DuVernay didn't make a \"good\" movie. What she has made is an endlessly watchable one, and I hope critics, at least, will soon embrace those other elements in addition to the film's social milestones \u2014 just like they'd do with any other notable movie. \"Isn't it nice to hear filmmakers of color talk about craft?\" DuVernay asked Korean-American filmmaker Justin Chon during a Q&A for his film Gook. There's nothing to be gained from shortchanging DuVernay's racial and feminist accomplishments with Wrinkle. But I hope one day we can appreciate the film beyond them, too."

This can be blocked by glass and therefore means that we are less likely to burn when inside.\n\"UVA however causes ageing of the skin and is not blocked by glass.\"\nAfter having the peel, Dawn's skin is smoother, stronger, springy and more radiant - but the greatest improvement has been her confidence.\nAlthough Dawn still sits by the window, she now applies SPF every day.\n\"I still can\u2019t believe that half of my face was damaged by the sun like that,\" she said. \"Thankfully it\u2019s all cleared now, and both sides of my face look young and healthy.\n\"I\u2019m telling my story to raise awareness of the dangers of sun damage \u2013 even if you\u2019re indoors.\n\"I\u2019m also incredibly grateful to Dr Aarti for not just giving me Botox like I first requested asked, but for actually taking time to explore the reason behind the problem and finding a more appropriate solution.\"\nIn related news, this mum-of-three who \u2018gets ID\u2019ed at 35\u2019 says \u00a31.50 Savlon antiseptic cream is the key to a fresh complexion."

Oh, she could play her part and play it well, but the dull edge of time whittled away at her interest and now she only went through the motions. Like a rat in a maze, her mind drifted though the infinite gambit of her daily routine- feed her soul sucking children, endure the tortures of drop off lanes and soccer games, slave away at a simple job any trained chimp could do, cook an underappreciated meal for the husband, pretend thrilled gratification in bed- and the only cheese in sight for all her good deeds was spelled out in big block letters- BOREDOM. Her life had become as lifeless as the reflection in the mirror. Was there no escape from this mundane existence? Was every day to be a ticking of endless seconds trickling like tree sap from youth to old age? Was she to reside motionless and meaningless within the slow yawn of time? Was there nothing beyond this? The apathy in her expression seemed to answer back dully. She sighed again and slowly turned away.\nI like this! Still dark but slightly humorous. I could feel the disdain for complacency, boredom, normalcy. Well done!\nAidia stared in confusion at the seemingly normal mirror. She saw herself, as one would expect. She saw the blade she held in hand. She saw the room behind her. All as one would expect. The odd thing was the blade of the knife had penetrated the mirror. Indeed it had even penetrated her arm. How is this possible she muttered. \u201cWhy would you do such a thing, Aidia?\u201d A face, twisted in mockery appeared in the mirror. She hadn\u2019t meant to. Had she? More confusion seeped in. \u201cAidia, why? Why would you do this?\u201d Another face, this one contorted in grief appeared. She struggled to turn around, but was unable to avert her eyes from this strange mirror. She stabbed at the mirror again, blood began to flow down both her arms. She flung the knife and beat on the mirror to no avail. No sound came. She couldn\u2019t even feel the mirror beneath her fists. She saw her reflection sink down to sit on the floor. In a panic, she started screaming. From nowhere, a fog clouded the mirror. A divinely beautiful face filled the surface. \u201cAidia, this is why you were chosen. You had no love left for yourself. This is how it could have ended. Now, you get to see your life take meaning.\u201d Her laughter was shrill and hideous. As Aidia looked closely, she saw her reflection get up, mouth a Thank You at her and walk away leaving Aidia to stare into the darkness."

For a long time no one had spoken. Bet Baxter was watching a seagull rising, wheeling, soaring and settling again on the water, her blue eyes glowing as she followed the long sweeping lines of its flight and the tilt of its wings. Joy Evans watched the gull with a different feeling. The thrill of its motion set every nerve in her body tingling with a desire to dance and skip or shout or laugh, while the quiet Shirley Williams did not see it at this moment; she was gazing into the finder of her camera as she pointed it toward the distant view of the Palisades. The girls were often to be found here under the big elm tree. It was their favorite spot in all that wide expanse of lawn and woodland that made up the Merriweather Estate, the home of Colonel Baxter. And here it was that they always brought their picnic feast, and today the basket reposed near by filled with surprises that Auntie Gibbs, the Baxter housekeeper loved to prepare for Bet and her friends. These girls had the run of the grounds, for Uncle Nat, the old gardener was as indulgent with this motherless girl as her easy-going father. What Bet wanted, she usually got, for no one could quite resist the charm of her smile, least of all her two chums, Shirley Williams and Joy Evans. They made a lovely picture as they sat there with the sunlight pouring down upon them. Bet's golden hair was rumpled by the wind-but then Bet's hair was mostly rumpled for one reason or another. Her face was flushed, her eyes bright-just because she was happy and enjoyed life. Shirley's head was bent over her camera. She was the serious one of the group. Shirley could enter into the good times as well as the others, but her smile came less quickly. And there were days, like the present, when her face would wrinkle with a frown as she tried to work out some problem in photography. Picture-taking was her hobby, and when the other girls skipped and danced about, Shirley would often trudge along burdened with a camera and tripod.\nClaim the \"The Merriweather Girls and the Mystery of the Queen's Fan.txt\""

At that time, I had some savings that I wanted to leave for Sisi, but in the end, she managed to get enough money for the surgery.\n\"At that time, we were very poor. Sisi quit school to become a sales attendant at a mall.

Many times when he had scheduled a meeting with her, he would fetch her at the entrance of A college, hence he always assumed she was still attending A college, not knowing that she had quit school.\n\"Afterwards, she became an actress. There was once I visited her at set. The conditions were harsh, and it was winter at that time. She caught a cold and was running a high fever, but she still persisted on continuing with filming. It really broke my heart... There was also once when she seemed to have angered someone, enduring two slaps, her face was swollen and her clothes were tattered. She ran home and when she saw me, she just broke down...\"\nFather Song started to tear up. \"At that time, she must have been devastated and helpless. She must have not been able to find anyone, so she came back, but I wasn't capable enough to help her. She stayed at home for about half a month before returning back to set. Afterwards, she seemed to realize that coming back would worry me so she never complained about anything anymore, but I knew that she must have struggled during those few years. On hindsight, I was really a useless father..\"\nWhen he heard that, his heart broke, and now it hurt even more. It was as if someone had stabbed a dagger deep into his heart, sending a sharp piercing pain throughout him."

It can affect one or both eyes.\nThe lacrimal gland constantly produces tears to keep the eyes moist and lubricated. The lacrimal gland is a small gland located above and outside each eye. When you blink, tears are spread over the front of your eyes to keep them moist.\nExcess tears usually drain away through tiny channels known as canaliculi, which are found on the inside of the eyes. The tears drain into a tear \u2018sac\u2019, then flow down a tube (tear duct) and into the nose.\nIf your tear ducts become blocked or narrowed, or if you have an eye infection, excess tears can build up and cause the tear ducts to overflow.\nWatering eye can be treated. Treatment depends on how severe the problem is and what is causing it. Mild cases of watering eye may not need treatment at all.\nEye conditions such as watering eye may have implications for driving.\nBabies are sometimes born with tear ducts that have not fully developed. This can cause their eyes to water. As their tear ducts finish developing (usually within a few weeks of birth), the problem disappears.\nIn adults, a blocked or narrowed tear duct is the most common cause of a watering eye. Over time, the tear ducts can become narrowed, often because of inflammation (swelling).\nIf your tear ducts are blocked or narrowed, your tears will be unable to drain away and will remain in the tear sac. The tear sac may become infected and your eye will produce a sticky liquid. You may also have a swelling on the side of your nose, next to your eye.\nOccasionally, the canaliculi (narrow drainage channels on the inside of your eyes) may become blocked. This can be due to inflammation or scarring.\nA watering eye can also be caused when the lower eyelid turns outwards away from the eye. This is known as ectropion. If this happens, your tears may not drain away properly.\nTreatment for watering eye depends on how severe the problem is and what is causing it. Treatment may not be necessary in mild cases.\nIf infective conjunctivitis is causing watering eye, the ophthalmologist may advise you to wait for a week or so to see if the condition resolves itself before prescribing a course of antibiotics.\nIf allergic conjunctivitis is causing watering eye, antihistamines may be prescribed to help reduce the inflammation (swelling).\nIf the cause is an inward-growing eyelash (entropion) or a foreign object (such as a piece of grit) in your eye, the eyelash or object can be removed.\nIf your lower eyelid turns outwards (ectropion), a minor operation under general anaesthetic may be recommended. The most common procedure involves tightening the tendon that holds the outer eyelid in place to give it extra support.\nBlocked tear ducts can be treated with surgery.\nDacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) is a common surgical procedure used to treat blocked tear ducts. It involves creating a new channel from the tear sac to the inside of your nose. This allows tears to bypass the blocked part of your tear duct.\nIf your canaliculi (the drainage channels on the inside of your eye) are narrowed but not completely blocked, it may be possible to use a probe to widen them. If the canaliculi are completely blocked by tears, an operation to drain them may be required.\nIn babies, watering eye often resolves itself within a few weeks without treatment. If a sticky liquid forms around your baby\u2019s eyes, remove it using a piece of cotton wool that has been soaked in sterile water (water that has been boiled and then cooled).\nMassaging the tear ducts may help dislodge tears that have collected in the upper part of your baby\u2019s tear duct, as well as encouraging the tear duct to develop. This can be done by applying light pressure with your finger and thumb to the outside of your baby\u2019s nose."

She, too, was not standing outside.\nI could only see her through the window. It was creepy, to say the least. I had no idea what to do about it. So, I tried to ignore it, and continue with my life.\nDuring the following week, more and more people gathered in front of my house. Sometimes, I could see them join the crowd, but most of them joined while I was at work, in the kitchen or sleeping.\nHowever, the worst things developed during the past week. They finally seemed to acknowledge that I was there, but this sudden shift in their attention didn\u2019t feel like a positive thing.\nThey stared at me, the whole group, a strange look in their eyes. They looked human, but something was off. Something uncanny. Like they were... hungry for me.\nAnd during the last three days, they have been getting closer to the window.

                            "text": "Will women buy a toolbox just because it\u2019s pink? Don\u2019t assume you know anything about what your customers really want.\nShopping for my stepson is always a challenge. So when his birthday rolled around, we found out what he wanted from his best friend: a stand-up rolling toolbox. That made perfect sense for Steve, a carpenter who had recently moved in with his girlfriend and had nowhere to store his many, many tools.\nHis father and I headed to the local Sears, which is known for its line of tools and toolboxes. There we found not only a great gift for Steve, but also a great lesson on how not to do target marketing.\nWe wandered among the many choices comparing prices and features. Did Steve really need drawers that could handle more than 25 pounds of weight? Yes, we decided, he did. Then we found a toolbox that seemed to have unusually solid construction for its pricing. There was only one problem: It was bright pink. (In case you think I\u2019m kidding, here it is.) We stood there for a few moments wondering whether Steve would actually tolerate a pink toolbox. No, his father decided. What the heck was Sears thinking?\n1. Don\u2019t ask customers what they want.\nOK, I have to admit I don\u2019t know for a fact that Sears skipped the market research on this one. But, try as I might, I just can\u2019t imagine sweat-stained, nail gun-toting, hard-working female carpenters confiding in a focus group that their jobs would be so much more pleasurable if only they could store their tools in\u2026 something pink.\n2. Be as superficial as possible.\nI don\u2019t do carpentry myself, but I do live in the country where I frequently dig rocks out of the earth and stack firewood. What I really appreciate at these moments are tools and equipment designed to fit my 5\u20194\u2033 frame. Work gloves sturdy enough to handle wood that fit my small hands are especially hard to find. Sometimes I come across pink ones, but most often they\u2019re inexpensive fabric things that would shred in the first hour of working with wood.\nActually designing tools suited to female bodies probably would have won Sears a lot of points with the audience it\u2019s trying to reach. But that would take a lot more effort and thought than simply painting something pink.\n3. Don\u2019t think things through.\nIt appeared the pink toolboxes were not a huge success. Or at least, Sears seemed pretty eager to unload them. Not only were they quite attractively priced, a store employee showed us a card the company had provided showing some suggested uses. There was a photo of the toolbox filled with a hair dresser\u2019s brushes and combs, and another in which it held jewelry making items.\nIf it was misguided to think female carpenters would jump at the chance to buy a toolbox just because it was pink, it seems even more absurd to suppose someone would want an expensive, heavy piece of metal furniture, designed to hold power tools weighing 50 pounds or more, to hold combs and hair ties, or beads and wires.\n\u201cI thought it was kind of insulting,\u201d the store employee said as he tucked the card back where he\u2019d concealed it behind the price tag. When your promotions are so cringe-worthy that salespeople actually hide them, chances are you\u2019re doing something wrong.\n4. Let stereotypes be your guide.\nIf you\u2019re a girl, you must love pink. I wonder if anyone at Sears even paused to consider this assumption. Women like pink\u2026 really? So much that we want it not only for our clothes and lipsticks, but the things we work with every day? Consider this: Women make most decisions about which kitchen appliances to buy, and most of them aren\u2019t pink. When it comes to furniture, if anything, most women prefer neutral colors that fit with a tasteful decor.\nSears, are you taking notes?"

                            "text": "Sometimes It Is Lupus: I Don't Need Help. Really.\nI have friends living upstairs. I have a son living with me. I have a daughter and son-in-law living next door. I am much better off than many lupies.\nIf I need help with anything at all, I just need to ask.\nBut usually I don't ask.\nOh, I ask my son to empty the dishwasher or take out the rubbish, but he lives with me. He helps dirty the dishes and create the rubbish. So it's OK to ask him to do those things.\nI don't want to be the needy person who's always wanting something from someone. So even though family and friends have actually offered to do my vacuuming and things, I usually put them off. I'm going to do it. OK, maybe not this week, but I'll get to it eventually. And if the vacuuming is done once every two or three months, it's still done. If the stack of dishes in the kitchen reaches to the ceiling, I'll catch up one day.\nI refuse help, I think, because if I accept the help, maybe I'll realize it's not an occasional thing, maybe I actually couldn't cope on my own. Maybe I can't be independent any more. And that would just be too much for me to accept.\nOf course, when it's something really important, I can ask for help, and I can accept it.\nI did ask my daughter for help recently. One of the lovely ladies from my church died, and I had a funeral to do. Ever since the day brain fog messed with my head so much while I was preaching that all my notes seemed to be gobbledygook, I've been afraid to lead worship again in case the same thing happened. I couldn't refuse this lovely lady's funeral, however. So I recruited my daughter to help. I wrote the service, and had my daughter read through it. The idea was that as long as she could assure me that what I wrote did indeed make sense as written, all I had to do on the day was read it. Whether it made sense to me or not when I read it wouldn't matter - because I had it independently verified that it did make sense. It worked. Actually, I got through the whole service without messing up, although I was exhausted at the end of it.\nWhen my handbag disappeared (presumed stolen because everyone has searched everywhere) I accepted help. I just searched, and stood by bemused while other people searched, checking places like the microwave and clothes dryer in case brain fog had led me to believe one of those places was the right place to leave my handbag. When my son said we were making a list of cards to cancel and change, keys to copy etc, I humbly and quietly accepted the help that's offered.\nSo I really am capable of asking for, and accepting, help. I'd just rather not do it. I'd rather be independent. I'd rather rely on myself... even if the self I'm relying on isn't very reliable. How's that working out for me? Well, some days it's OK."

At age nine, Clare's decision was to enroll herself into public school, because she wanted to be like the other kids, and do what the other kids were doing.\nAt age ten, her favorite activities were dancing, gardening, and Girls Incorporated. Dancing she took at our local dance studio. Gardening they would teach that summer at Girls Incorporated. Each girl would grow her own garden.\nIt was to be Clare's last summer at Girls Inc., and she had many delightful daydreams about how it would go, who she would meet, what they would do, and the fun they'd have. She also looked forward to middle school in the fall, which she imagined was similar to a TV show called Ned's Declassified Middle School Survival Guide.\nAside from that, Clare's general plan was to recline on the futon watching TV shows and playing video games all day, with all meals delivered to her side.\n\u201cMom! I'm hungry,\u201d she called from the couch.\nAll through fifth grade, Clare tried unsuccessfully to grow plants indoors, where they died for lack of sunlight. When she planted them outdoors, she forgot to water them. She also failed a school assignment meant to answer the question, \u201cDo Larger Seeds Yield Larger Plants?\u201d because she waited too long to plant the seeds, so we never found out.\nShe used sunflower seeds for the experiment. So we planted two seeds of equal size in the back yard just for fun. These were the kind of sunflowers that reach heights of up to six feet.\nThen came the end of elementary school.\nForget moons and solstices. Any exuberant kid can tell you that the first day of summer is the last day of school.\nClare showed up at our front door with her friend Margaret.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Clare, as they embarked on some unplanned adventure along a quiet, peaceful, tree-lined street in sweet home Alameda.\nA few minutes later I was in the attic sipping coffee, and looking forward to our trip to Eureka. I'd stayed up half the night before, creating a full color travel brochure for Clare while she slept. We'd see giant redwoods, which had captured Clare's interest when she saw two baby redwoods, small enough to be mistaken for weeds, growing on the grounds at Girls Inc. Then Clare's uncle Frank walked in.\n\u201cYes?\u201d I called down from upstairs.\nMy emotional reaction to this horrifying news was no emotional reaction at all.\n\u201cIs she alive?\u201d I asked politely.\n\u201cYes, but her leg may be broken. Just go on out to her,\u201d said Frank.\nNext thing I knew I was running up the street, but my legs felt leaden, just like one of those nightmares I had as a kid. It was like I couldn't remember how to run. I couldn't seem to pull my legs along, as desperately as I wanted to reach my daughter.\nIt seemed to take all day to run two short blocks, to the grassy green spot where my daughter was lying on her back, her leg bent most unnaturally, her head pressed against the ground, the blazing sun staring her in the face.\nWhat happened was that Clare and Margaret had seen an ice cream truck. Margaret had said, \u201cI'll go get the money and you go wait by the truck.\u201d Clare had bolted into the street without thinking, and was hit.\nI rode in the ambulance with Clare to Oakland Children's Research Hospital. The drive seemed like hours, but probably took ten minutes.\nThe doctors treated my daughter with no questions asked. Both the bones in her lower leg were severed. I cringed at her agonizing screams, which lasted for hours after she emerged from surgery, where they put metal pins in her leg to hold the bones in place so they could heal.\nI occupied a cot next to her bed for five days. Hospital staff kept talking to me, but I kept forgetting what they wanted, or didn't understand the words they spoke. Straining to pay attention, I overheard doctors using the word catatonic, so I held my daughters hand and looked at her. She was looking right back at me and obviously speaking to me, even if I couldn't understand what she was saying, so I wondered what they meant by catatonic. Then I realized it was me they were talking about. Emotional shock, they said.\nI eventually got my daughter home, and helped her up the steps to our apartment. We occupied the top part of a house. She'd have to stay mainly indoors for a while. I put her on the futon in front of the TV, grateful to still have a daughter I could bring meals to while she watched her favorite shows and played video games.\nBut Clare was inconsolable. She'd need crutches and a wheelchair. She would not be allowed to dance for six months. What's worse, she could not attend her last summer camp at Girls Inc. She would not get to grow the gorgeous green garden her mind had already sown. We were also not going to Eureka. Few girls have ever been more miserable than my daughter was throughout this long, lonely summer.\nFor a while, Clare refused to go outside, dreading the strange looks she had already experienced a time or two. But at some point, she got an idea.\n\u201cI wonder how my sunflowers are doing,\u201d said Clare.\n\u201cLet's go out in the yard and see!\u201d I chirped.\nI entered through the back yard gate, with Frank pushing Clare in her wheelchair a short way behind me. I looked at the sunflowers we'd planted. It was too late to stop her from seeing what I saw. One of the sunflowers was about twelve inches tall and doing okay, but the other one had tried to grow up too fast, reached a height of about two feet, then buckled under the weight of its own head. It now lay face down in the dirt, its pretty head beginning to wither and wilt in the staring sun, the stem sharply bent and all but completely severed. It reminded me of Clare's broken leg.\n\u201cFrank, take me back inside,\u201d said Clare.\nAs Frank wheeled her away, I examined that pathetic sunflower. There seemed no way to save it, but I couldn't stand to see it all bent and broken. I did what I could to stand it upright, splinting it on both sides with two sticks in the ground. The sticks were three feet high, so I rested the sunflower's head on one of them, and held the severed stem in place with a piece of twisted wire. No water had reached beyond the break in the stem. The sunflower was already turning a necrotic shade of brown.\nWe spent the next few weeks inside. Clare was obviously depressed. Even her favorite video games bored her before too long.\nOne morning I walked into the kitchen and looked out my east-facing kitchen window. All that is visible from this window is the beige stucco siding of the neighbor's house, and the top of a tall wood fence. I walked up to the window and looked down into the yard. The sunflowers were still there, both facing east to follow the sun. The smaller one had grown a bit. The larger one still stood upright, crucified as it was to the sticks in the ground. But someone must have pushed those sticks further into the ground, as the sunflower's head was now unsupported, and only had its own fragile stem to lean on.\n\u201cLet's go outside and check the sunflowers,\u201d I said to Clare.\nI fixed a snack for Clare, went to the living room, and checked on her cast. I forgot to go downstairs and tend the sunflowers.\nSome weeks later I walked to the kitchen window. I thought I must be hallucinating, because the larger sunflower seemed to have gotten nearer.\nReluctantly, Clare hobbled her way to the kitchen window, leaned on her crutches, and looked down.\n\u201cLet's go down and see!\u201d I suggested.\nWe made our way down that burdensome flight of cement steps beyond our front door, and around to the back yard. The larger sunflower was taller than I am, and I am almost six feet tall. It seemed to have reached its maximum height! The stem had now thickened, and the breaking point was now a healing scar. Even the smaller sunflower was four feet tall.\nWe went back upstairs and, as always, the next thing happened, so we forgot about the sunflowers once again.\nFinally came the day when Clare had her pins removed, and her cumbersome, thigh-high cast replaced with a much lighter one that ended just below her knee. It was a major milestone in her recovery.\nOn the morning we got home from that doctor's visit, Clare flopped down on the futon and grabbed the remote, as I walked into the kitchen to fix her a meal. I looked out the kitchen window and gasped.\n\u201cClare!!!\u201d I squealed, like a giddy little girl.\n\u201cWhat!!!\u201d came Clare's annoyed reply.\n\u201cLook out the kitchen window!!!\u201d I insisted.\nClare walked casually into the kitchen on her new cast, and there we both stood, gaping in stunned disbelief at the sight outside our sunny, east facing, second-story kitchen window. We both slowly approached the window, unable to quite believe what we were seeing - the face of a gigantic sunflower, about a basketball in diameter, staring right back at us through a 2nd story window! It should've been facing in an easterly direction like the other sunflower, but it had somehow twisted itself around to the west, away from the sun and toward we who are its friends.\n\u201cLet's go check the sunflowers!\u201d I said, but Clare had already bounded down the steps like her leg was never broken.\n\u201cCareful!\u201d I yelled out to her, wondering why I bother.\nI walked to the back yard, where Clare stood smiling broadly, her arm around her giant sunflower friend, which was now more than eleven feet tall! Her other arm embraced its twin sibling, about four-feet-six inches tall.\n\u201cHow did this one get so tall?\u201d she asked.\nWe still don't understand why that sunflower grew as tall as it did, or why it faced so willfully west, as if trying to see inside our kitchen window.\nClassic Short Stories And Poems Collection."

Soon bunches of vibrant green stalks will be popping up at farm stands and grocery stores. Whether you prefer your asparagus on the thick or thin side, it\u2019s important to trim the pale ends of each stalk because they tend to be woody and tough.\nYou might be accustomed to simply bending each stalk until it snaps in half, especially if you grew up snapping green beans. It\u2019s a simple method, and doesn\u2019t even require a knife. The stalk will break right where it starts to get tough\u2014or that\u2019s what you\u2019ve been told all these years.\nThe truth is that the bend-and-snap method can actually waste perfectly good asparagus. (Sorry, snappers!) The way a stalk breaks depends on the overall thickness of the stalk (skinny stalks are more flexible), how you bend it, and even how fresh the asparagus is (super-fresh asparagus tends to be more rigid). So although it might look like you\u2019re getting rid of the tough ends, you\u2019re probably also snapping off too much of the edible green stalks too.\nThe best way to trim asparagus is also the most obvious way: with a chef\u2019s knife and cutting board. Line up all of the spears in a row and slice off the ends all at once. You should cut right where the stalks turn from white into green.\nIf you\u2019re still not convinced, do a side-by-side comparison with two asparagus stalks of the same length and size. Use the bend-and-snap method with one stalk and see how it compares to a stalk that has been trimmed with a knife. The stalk that has been snapped will probably be a few inches shorter.\nAnd when you\u2019re talking asparagus\u2014which can be pricey, even when in season\u2014a few inches can make a big difference!"

What she served us reminded me so much of a much loved recipe that I used to make back when I first learnt to cook, one that I had inexplicably forgotten about , that I had to run home to make it again. My recipe has capers in it- which I love for an extra salty hit, Raffaella\u2019s was just as good without.

                            "text": "All you need is 7 everyday ingredients, a baking tray and 15 minutes to put together this restaurant quality Roasted Lemon Parmesan Asparagus. The perfect side dish for your Easter feast!\nSpring has well and truly sprung for the Northern Hemisphere and fresh asparagus bunches are everywhere whenever I visit a supermarket or fruit store. Not to mention the amount of recipes I\u2019ve seen popping up with asparagus as the hero ingredient.\nI love using asparagus in recipes like curries or pasta, but I think it\u2019s at its best when roasted. Of course, you can simply roast asparagus in some olive oil and salt and pepper. But there\u2019s just something magic when vegetables are roasted with parmesan cheese, don\u2019t you think? Add a little lemon and garlic to the equation and you\u2019ve got yourself a certified flavour explosion.\nThis Roasted Lemon Parmesan Asparagus is a restaurant quality side dish that couldn\u2019t be simpler to prepare. Impress your family and friends and pop this on the table this Easter.\nAsparagus is packed full of goodness including Vitamins A, C & K and folic acid. And 5 spears counts as 1 of your 5 serves of veg!\nYou probably already have them on hand right now, but if you don\u2019t you\u2019ll be able to easily use them for other recipes also.\n15 minutes fast. Probably shorter. I doubt it will take you 5 full minutes to prepare.\nWhy have regular old roasted asparagus when you can sprinkle it with lemon, garlic and parmesan and make it a flavoursome side dish?\nYou want to remove the tough woody ends of asparagus spears before cooking. There\u2019s two mains ways that you can do this \u2013 bend and snap OR chop. I\u2019m team chop.\nThere\u2019s many a tutorial out there advocating for bending and snapping the ends off asparagus spears, but this is one \u201chack\u201d I wouldn\u2019t recommend.\nWhilst it\u2019s super satisfying to hear the snap, there\u2019s no consistency in where the asparagus breaks off, and you could easily lose perfectly edible asparagus. And I just hate wasting food!\nInstead, simply place the asparagus bunch on a chopping board and cut where the spear goes from white to green, approximately an inch from the bottom.\nYou can also run your knife from the bottom of the stalk and cut where you find the least resistance. With this method, you easily get rid of the tough ends at the same time with minimal effort.\nPre-heat the oven to 200C / 400F.\nWash and trim your asparagus spears then on a baking tray.\nCover the asparagus with lemon juice, minced garlic and olive oil and mix well with your hands to ensure all spears are evenly coated.\nSpread the spears into a single layer, sprinkle with salt, pepper and grated parmesan (as shown in the picture above), then place in the oven for 10 minutes, or until the asparagus is tender.\nServe immediately, sprinkling over extra parmesan if you wish.\nChoose a bunch that has thicker stems. The thinner stems tender to be less tender and more chewy.\nIf you\u2019re serving this dish to impress, sprinkle some extra parmesan over before you serve and pop some lemon slices on top.

Social contractors were called in to build up walls around my heart that were guaranteed to keep out anyone that I didn't let in through the front door. All the same, I steered clear. Even after her family had moved away, I refused to drive within several blocks of her house for fear that I'd decide to drive by out of nostalgia and find myself lost in the past. There were enough ghosts haunting me as it was, no need to let another demon out of the closet. Maybe if we'd parted on bad terms or if we hadn't been such good friends. Maybe if we'd hated each other or maybe if the newness had worn away. Maybe if we'd ended things on a sour note I wouldn't think back and wonder if things could've been different. Maybe is a word we use when we can't admit to ourselves that the pain is still too much to bear, that the loss hurts more than you're willing to let on.\nStrange that we should pass each other on the street that day. I'd decided to drive down that old street on a whim, a fit of ill humor taking control of the wheel and guiding me down a road I hadn't traveled in years. As I came closer to her house, I noticed a familiar car parked across the street. It was almost as though the house had been calling out to us. I drove past her slowly. Tears were running down her face when our eyes locked. Memories flooded over the top of the wall, raining down hundreds of moments on my head in that brief moment. It's strange. A thousand years had passed since last I'd seen her, nearly as many since I'd decided to bury my memories of her. Yet here she was, just as I remembered her. My heart broke when I saw the tears. I'd have given anything at that moment to make them stop. I'd have promised her the world if it meant that my last memory of her wasn't of her in tears.\nI sat at the stop sign, staring into my rearview mirror. What was I waiting for? This was fate crying out to me to run back to her to take her in my arms and promise that I'd never leave her again. Wasn't it? Time stopped in that moment. My mind raced, scenarios playing out in my mind of what might happen next.\nAnd then I blinked. Her car was gone. It's hard telling if she was even there at all. Maybe my mind was playing tricks on me, revealing to me just how much I missed her in my life. Maybe I'd closed my eyes for longer than I thought and she'd sped away. Maybe maybe maybe."

One thing that always interested me was the fact that the sun was actually a star, stars a made up of big balls of as that take millions of years to shine down on earth and by the time we actually see them they could have burnt out and died, I love the whole idea of naming a star I know it gives a lot of people a piece of mind to see a star sparkling in the sky, when I was little my mum would tell me that it was a lost relative looking down on me (I know sounds like the Lion King) so I've always loved that notion. The idea to give someone a star named after them or something they loved has always been something I wanted to do either for myself or a loved one, I was actually given the chance to name my own star thanks to the Star name registry, at first I didn't know what to name it I thought long and hard about what my mum told me when I was younger and settled on the name Noah. This name means a lot to me, I was going to name my first child this but unfortunately, I was never able to, I always thought of the babies I don't have with me as my little stars and decided to name my star Noah, my little star in the sky. Some people may find that morbid but I find comfort it in, it makes me smile, especially when it's so close to Mother's Day, that's why I think naming a star would be a wonderful Mother's day gift. If you put an order in for one right now it will be with you or your loved one by Mother's Day, your star name will be registered within 24 hours of your order then take 1-3 working days to be delivered within the UK. My star is in the boundaries or the Ursa Minor constellation, it is also known as the Little Bear within the Northern Sky, Little Bear's tail can also be mistaken for a ladle and that's why it also has a North American name, The Little Dipper.\nI would name it Willow after my niece, and I would frame it for her. She's nearly 4, I think it would be cool for her to have it on her name so she could look at it and understand it more as she gets older.\nI'd name one for my daughter, she'd love that.\nI would name it MR G after my hubby, he would love it!\nLovely for my little boy Gregory Ian.\nthe Audsley star for all those in my family who we have lost over the years.\nI'd name it after our wee one!\nI'd name it after my sister Fleur.\nI'd let my kids name it."

She is sooo cute.\nI was originally going for a pitt bull. (Which is a breed that I still love.) But, the man bred the female pitt that I was going to get. And he refused to sell her til the pups were born. I was heartbroken. I had just lost my pitt named Molly a few weeks ago and while I wasn't looking for a Basset, something about Camry just popped up to me. I took one look at her and fell madly in love.\nWe went to pick her up and found out that she was actually going to be put to sleep. This beautiful, young, energetic (as much as you can imagine a Basset being) fur baby was going to be put to sleep! We immediately took her.\nShe's now got a place in the bedroom right next to the bed in her cozy doggie-bed and she loves it. I'd let her sleep in the bed but A: my fiance does NOT agree with sharing a bed with two girls and B: The bed's really high up and the veterinarian said it'd be hell on her joints to climb up and down it all the time. So we compromised and she now sleeps right next to the bed.\nIn the morning she wakes us up when she has to go out to do her business and when we go somewhere and put her in her x-large crate she doesn't make a single mess. She lays there looking as pitiful as possible (not hard for her) til we come home. Then it's like she's saying \"Where did you go! I thought I'd never see you again! Oh my gosh! Im so glad your back. Let's go lay down and cuddle!\" Lol. Which I don't mind a bit. I love her and she's going to have a home til her last day!\nComments for Welllll not my first choice. But I fell in LOVE!\nI also tried to get my bassets into my bed but my hubby wouldnt allow it....so now my bassets and dachshunds sleep in the spare room (their own bedroom). They also have beds in the family room - how spoilt are they? Don't be suprised, as bassets are very energetic. A lot of people think that they are always lazy but that couldnt be further from the truth. They are such loveable, sociable dogs and are wonderful with children too.\nI am so happy for you and your new family member! My husband and I just adopted our first Basset, Shortcake. She is 5 years old and a tricolor. I am so in love with her and she brings a new joy to our lives. I wish you and your new dog many years of happiness.\nReally sorry to hear that you lost your Pitt Bull.\nOn the other hand, congratulations on getting (and rescuing) a Basset Hound! Quite a change in breed. But, it sounds like Camrey fits right into your home and life.\nMy Basset Hound sleeps in his cozy dog bed right next to my bed too. He actually has two beds. One is downstairs. That's the one he uses when he wants to hang with us in the family room. The other is in my bedroom. When I go to bed, he wanders upstairs a little while after I do and sleeps in that one.\nEnjoy! Thanks for sharing your story."

                            "text": "Kaylee Baldwin: \"I Will Never Have Him Again\"\nAbout a year ago, I saw the saddest sight I have ever seen so far in my life. I talk about it a little more in depth here, but it was the sight of a friend carrying his son's casket down the aisle at church, all by himself, tears running down his cheeks, as he carried him outside to the waiting car. My heart broke for this dad and this family, who was now facing life without their precious son. Every painful year, day, minute, and even second, they would feel the loss of this little person who had filled their lives with love and joy. But, the family said, we know we will see him again. Because of Christ, we know that he will live again.\nLast night, while winding down after a long day, I turned on CNN to watch a few minutes of news before bed. Pierce Morgan was talking to the dad of a child who had been killed in the Newtown shooting.\nMy heart went out to this father, who was so dignified, so compassionate, and yet, at times, the pain would overwhelm his features as he spoke of his little boy. I still get tears in my eyes when I think about his parting words to Morgan about his son. As his face filled with anguish, the dad said: \"I will never have him again.\"\nI can't even write these words without crying--the saddest words I believe I have ever heard. I will never have him again. I cannot imagine the pain of believing that your child is lost to you.\nI thought about this phrase all night long, wishing I could tell this father that he will see his son again. That, though his body is dead, his spirit lives. That, though he is lost to him now, Christ came that lost things may be found again. Every lost thing.\nMy mind is heavy with thoughts of these families facing the holidays without their precious children--perhaps because I have a son who is five years old and in kindergarten and my mind keeps putting him in the place of these kids. Perhaps because I have seen friends go through the pain of losing a child and those feelings are still fresh.\nI have a favorite conference talk that I share with people often. I carry a copy of it around with me, and I've had the opportunity to hand it out several times to people who are struggling with the the loss of a loved one and share with them the most hopeful words I've ever heard. Here's the link if you want to read it in full, but I am going to include my favorite passage from it. Not only is it appropriate for what has happened in Newtown and for anyone who is struggling right now through unimaginable trials, but also for Christmas, when we remember the Light of the World and the great gift He gave us.\nAnd if you're thinking: Kaylee, this post is too serious and too long and I'm going to skip this quote... I get that. I know I've had a series of kind of heavy posts, and it won't always be this way over here, but sometimes life gets serious. And sometimes we need a reminder of hope.\nI've underlined the very best part of this quote, the life changing, hopeful part that I have memorized and think of whenever I get overwhelmed with this life, so if you are going to skip everything else, at least read that.\n\"I think of how dark that Friday was when Christ was lifted up on the cross.\nThank you so much for sharing this. I was baptized when I was 14, two weeks to the day before my mother died of complications from a brain tumor surgery. I don't know what I'd have done without the knowledge I'd gained from the missionaries. I've always said the Lord got to me just in time. It was hard enough even with my new testimony.\nThank you for posting this. It is a great reminder to everyone who is sad and in despair. And as we celebrate his birth in a few days we can remember his comfort and love.\nBeautiful thoughts, and exactly what I feel whenever I see people grieving. This isn't the end! I wish so much people could see that.\nHeartfelt and lovely, Kaylee. The quote is wonderful and so hopeful. I'm grateful I know what I do so I can focus on having a forever family.\nDefinitely not too serious or too long. It breaks my heart and brings tears to my eyes as well, but the quote brings a great light to it all. Glad you shared."

                            "text": "I first heard about Mind Hike one Friday evening. I was idly scrolling through Facebook when I noticed a link to Mind's website. I clicked on the events page, saw the Mind Hike and thought \"I could do that\".\nPerhaps I was a little impulsive. I filled in the application form without thinking too much about it. I briefly explained why the hike appealed to me - that my mum had taken her own life a couple of months before my son's first birthday and that I wanted to do something in her memory as well as raise awareness and money - but I didn't give much consideration to the hike itself. I have family near the Lake District so I'm familiar with the area, and hiking's just an endurance test really isn't it? I'd just need a bit of determination and some decent shoes, right?\nI thought about it more after submitting my application form, and I settled on two facts: 1) this was going to be really difficult - both physically (hiking 40 mountainous miles in 24 hours is no walk in the park) and from a fundraising perspective (there's a minimum sponsorship level of \u00a3650); and 2) I absolutely had to get a place. I wrote to Mind. I explained I didn't think I'd done a great job on my application form, gave them some more information about myself, and upped my sponsorship target from the minimum to \u00a31,000.\nNone of this will come as a surprise to people who know me well - I'm a big fan of making my life more difficult than it already is! I explained how I planned to raise the money: I'd set up a fundraising page, as recommended, I'd do bake sales, I'd ask for donations from corporations \u2013 I'd basically make sure I met my target.\nI really wanted to do it and I really wanted to do it properly.\nI'd thought that I'd share some information about what happened to my mum on the page, but what came out when I sat down to write it shocked even me. I think I was ready to open up. I wrote paragraph after paragraph about our relationship, her interactions with my son and what it was like to hear she'd taken her own life. It just poured out. I wrote it all in less than an hour.\nI was 31 when my mum took her own life. My son, her only and much awaited grandchild, was not even ten months old. Nothing could have prepared me for the evening in March 2013 when my dad arrived on my doorstep to tell me she was gone. We found out more later; she'd taken her life downstairs in our family home while my dad was upstairs working.\nI was devastated. And more than that, I was furious. I recall holding a glass and wanting so badly to hurl it across the kitchen. And then I remembered. I have a baby. I can't do that. I can't cover my kitchen in tiny shards of glass, put glass on his high chair, on his toys.\nI'm still angry. But not with her. I'm angry with the mental health problems that took her away from me, from her friends and family and from her grandchild.\nI wrote all of this on my fundraising page and then waited. Did I really want to share all this? I had to make sure my dad was ok with it, so I spoke to him. I talked to some of my friends and my husband. Did everyone need to know all of this?\nI pressed \"post\" after a good deal of staring at the screen, and I went and watched TV to take my mind off it. When I warily checked my page an hour later, I'd already raised over \u00a3300. I couldn't believe it! That was almost a third of my target! And I'd received so many messages of support. I was speechless.\nThe \u00a31,000 target I'd set was clearly way too low. It was smashed overnight within 12 hours.\nI'd vastly underestimated my friends' and family's generosity and empathy with the topic I was raising money for.\nAfter a few days, as the donations kept coming, I upped my target to \u00a32,500. That too has now been exceeded and I'm wondering where to go next with this. I don't want to stop raising money for Mind simply because the targets have been met. I want to raise as much as I can.\nI also want to normalise talking about mental health issues as much as possible. This isn't something that has just affected my family and those close to my mum. This can affect all of us. And help is out there.\nTo read more about Lynsey's story visit her fundraising page.\nOn Monday 26 June we'll announce the exciting new route for Mind Hike 2018, watch this space and book early for next year's challenge."

I was so excited to hear about Britney Spears on Jane the Virgin, even before I saw the sneak peek from her guest role. However, after watching the preview, I'm even more stoked. Spears is the queen of TV cameos, but this reminded me of one of my favorites \u2014 when the singer guest-starred on Sabrina the Teenage Witch.\nThe cameo to end all cameos came courtesy of some cross-promotion between Melissa Joan Hart's 1999 movie Drive Me Crazy and Spears' \"(You Drive Me) Crazy,\" which appeared on the soundtrack. As a result, Hart appeared in the music video for the song and Spears made a brief, but perfect, cameo on Sabrina the Teenage Witch. You can watch the clip below, but I'll summarize: Sabrina is lonely in Paris, her dad conjures up Britney Spears \u2014 straight from the middle of a concert, no less \u2014 and the two get some quality hang-time. Not only do we get to hear Spears singing a little bit (\"(You Drive Me) Crazy,\" of course), but the singer also dispensed some pretty good advice.\nWatching the teaser for Spears' appearance on Jane the Virgin, however, I couldn't help notice some similarities. Not only does the singer seem to be playing herself, but there is a dance scene. I repeat: We get to watch Jane bust out some Britney Spears choreography with the superstar herself. Oh, and they just happen to be dancing to \"Toxic.\" I'm officially overwhelmed by how great this is. The dance scene in particular reminds me of when Spears and Hart had a heart-to-hart (I couldn't resist) while doing some of the singer's choreography.\nAdditionally, we're also treated to Spears' sense of humor and her down-to-earth nature. It's been 16 \u2014 yes, 16 \u2014 years since her cameo on Sabrina, but it's nice to know that some things never change. You can check out the preview for Spears' guest appearance on Jane the Virgin below."

One of my nutrition professors frequently extolled the nutrition and health virtues of this favorite vegetable of hers. Indeed, asparagus is a good source of many nutrients, particularly folate and vitamins A & K. It also contains inulin, a soluble fiber that fuels the good bacteria you want in your gut. Asparagus is also rich in a number of phytochemicals (plant chemicals that work various disease prevention jobs in the human body).\nInitially I gobbled up asparagus because it made me feel like Popeye opening a can of spinach \u2014 sometimes when you believe a food is good for you, it makes you feel like you\u2019re pretty awesome just for eating it. Over time, I actually grew to love the taste and texture of this funny looking veggie. But it is definitely an acquired taste since it contains several bitter chemical components in addition to the one that gives it the lovely melting butter mouth feel.\nMy favorite way to prepare asparagus is to toss it with a little oil, salt and either parmesan cheese or nutritional yeast flakes\u2026then roast in the oven for 15 minutes at about 400 degrees.\nIf you\u2019re not in love with asparagus yet, consider giving it another try this year. Luckily, it is amenable to just about any preparation technique: boil, steam, blanch, saute, roast, grill, or eat it fresh. With the right recipe, you might find a new appreciation for asparagus. Since Spring is asparagus\u2019 (all-too-short) season, here are some delicious recipes for you to experiment with just in time. And best of all they are nearly all created by dietitians\u2013we love good food!\nAsparagus and Brie Grilled Cheese with Arugula Pesto by Kara Lydon, The Foodie Dietitian.\nAnd one of my personal favs is this Salmon Ni\u00e7oise Salad from Bon App\u00e9tit. Just replace the green beans with steamed asparagus\u2013divine! While it\u2019s technically a salad, it really makes for a full meal.\nHave a fabulous asparagus filled Spring! Let me know if you try one of these and love it."

With the claim of a friend who thought he might have indeed seen it on the couch, the realization hit me. I left it. On the couch. For the first time, I left something valuable. For the first time, I did not check and recheck."

                            "text": "This weekend while in Universal, I experienced an incredible feeling. We had just come back from one of the parks and I was sitting waste high in the pool, leaning against the edge. I closed my eyes and started thinking about the fact that this was the first time my eldest daughter Elle had not gone on a vacation with us. As my heart started to swell, I remembered all the first with her. The first time she saw a Disney character and clung to me for safety. The first time I played with her in the Boardwalk pool and we slid down the clown slide until we were both exhausted. I remembered convincing her to ride on all the rollercoasters and the look on her face as she ran to get back in line. The memories overwhelmed me and sadness numbed me with the thought that I would never experience those feelings with her again. I was suddenly jolted out of my trance when my youngest daughter \u201cBaby\u201d jumped on my back and said, \u201cTake me around the pool, I wanna ride you like a dolphin.\u201d I smiled , and began swimming around the pool, or at least attempting to swim around the pool with a 14yr old 110lb passenger. After her ride, I spit out the gallon of water I had engulfed to find myself suddenly attacked by Emma (middle daughter) who loves to tickle me at any opportunity that she can. The lunch we had ordered came and both girls jumped out of the pool, ran over to a pool side table and started eating. Once again, I found myself alone in the pool daydreaming about the past. I remembered all three girls clinging to me as we played in the pool. I remembered the double strollers we managed to make into triple strollers and race car driving them around the parks. When they were young, we jumped on beds, sung songs, went to character breakfast, watched fireworks, swam at night and everything else I ever dreamed a family would do together. Along the way we built a life lasting bond. Once I had snapped out of the past, I realized that the present was in my hands and it was my choice to do with it as I decided. We spent this weekend doing everything we could do.\nI enjoyed \u201cBaby\u201d and \u201cEmma\u201d for what I could do with them now. I thought of what a great woman Elle has become and how much I enjoy talking to her now as an adult. I truly had the best time I could have ever had, with the best life a person could ever ask for.\nNote: In all the time I spent daydreaming I never remembered anything bad about the trips with the girls. Bad memories come and go but the good ones last a lifetime.\nAre you TRYING to make me cry!?! (an easy feat on the first day of school for my 3 \"big\" kids.) Glad you had a great time. You deserve it!\nEnjoy them while they are the age they are and then enjoy them at the next age too.\nSo many people just go through the motions and never stop to appreciate all the little moments. Sounds like you've truly enjoyed your children!"

Classes were a drag, my work load was overwhelming, and with two jobs, I seemed to have no time for any writing. It may come as no surprise to hear that I wasn't looking forward to missing three days of classes for a convention I wasn't even excited about. Presentations make me nervous, and as February 26 drew closer, my anxiety was growing exponentially.\nI had to force myself to get on the plane in Dayton, OH, but the closer I got to Georgia, the more excited I felt. I thought about the snow I was leaving behind and the sunshine awaiting me. I ignored my growing anxiety over my presentation enough to enjoy exploring Savannah on Wednesday. By Thursday, I was completely relaxed and having a wonderful time. I attended different presentations and met new people who, it was clear to see, had the same love for English that I remembered once having.\nFinally, 2:00 p.m. on Friday arrived and I found myself seated in front of about 15 people, about to present my paper on epic heroines. For the past two days, I had been telling myself I wasn't nervous. Friday morning, I had admitted to myself that I was extremely nervous, but suddenly I realized I wasn't nervous. I was excited. The other panelists and I had been chatting, along with our session chair and moderator, and I realized that everyone wanted to be there. At that moment, I remembered my love for English in its entirety. I remembered how I had felt in my sophomore year of high school, when I first realized I wanted to do something with English for the rest of my life. I remembered how I felt every time I finished a really good book. I remembered how I felt when writing anything. I remembered how happy I was to receive my invitation to join Sigma Tau Delta because it meant I was even more involved in my English Department.\nAfter presenting my paper, I walked outside into the sunshine, and said a silent \"thank you\" to Savannah, GA, for hosting a beautiful convention that made me fall in love with words all over again, and for giving me the inspiration I needed to write my way through the rest of my junior year."

Due to its gold-colored, and thus prestigious-looking, faceplate, and simple operation for key financial calculations, it has been very popular over the years among financial professionals. It is in fact HP\u2019s longest and best selling model, in continual production since its introduction in 1981.\nCaption: The most powerful financial calculator made.\n1981, the first business \"personal computer\" was unveiled, Pac-Man was the blockbuster video game, and Chariots of Fire was a box office hit. When floppy disks were still floppy and 5.25 inches square, and a computer\u2019s memory was still measured in kilobytes instead of megabytes.\nThe designers HP-12c decided to lay out the calculator in a horizontal position, partly because it would accommodate all the keys and many adding machines were oriented horizontally. The gold-on-brown colors gave the little calculator an air of seriousness and value that made it a status symbol sitting on a desk. The HP 12c team concluded that they would design the calculations in the 12c to be so precise that the calculator could receive certification by the federal Bureau of Standards (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology). Hence, HP 12c\u2019s results were legally accurate for the banking industry.\nThe algorithms used to perform calculations such as bond interest and partial payments on home mortgages were critical if the calculator was to be trusted by the financial world and meet the U.S. standards. HP consulted with experts from various countries to be certain that the calculator would work in markets using different methods of calculation all over the world. HP worked with William Kahan, UC Berkeley\u2019s renowned professor of mathematics, electrical engineering and computer science, to develop and test the complex algorithms.\nTagged By: Silver anniversary dawns for HP\u2019s iconic calculator."

His hands shook a little as he slid them in his pockets feeling for the keys. His eyes glanced at something out of place behind the building, both dumpster lids were open. He walked to the dumpsters and looked inside them, the keys softly jingling in his shaking hands. He did not see any illegally dumped trash so he flipped the tops over which banged when they closed. His neighbor was outside by his car and jumped. He looked at the dumpsters and waved to Joe.\n\u201cThanks, see you later.\u201d Joe flexed his fingers, they didn\u2019t bend as well as they once did and he was glad his neighbor helped maintain the store. The neighbor waved and disappeared into his car. The gears ground their way into reverse and he backed into the street crunching dried Douglas fir needles on his driveway and left.\nJoe shook his head at his neighbor, he seemed he would never learn how to drive a stick. Joe labored to walk back to the store. He inserted the door key and turned the knob. Inside he flipped on a couple dirty light switches and headed towards the office. He looked down the aisles for anything out of place and everything seemed okay.\nInside the office, he pulled a creaky old chair back from a well-worn desk. His legs ached from the walk to the dumpsters. He dropped the keys on the desk and opened the cabinet next to him and pressed the stop button on the old VCR. The tape whined as Joe rewound it to see what happened last night to the dumpsters. When it finished and clicked off, he pressed play and fast-forwarded to when the dumpster lids opened. His face paled seeing what appeared on the tape and hit pause. He pushed crumpled receipts and old order sheets around his desk until he unburied a faded coffee-stained note with a phone number. He picked up the avocado green phone and called as quickly as the rotary dial would let him.\nRedhawk arrived a half hour later and knocked on the front door of the store. Joe shuffled slowly over from the office, unlocked the deadbolt and opened the door for Redhawk.\nJoe closed the door behind Redhawk and locked it. He smiled weakly, \u201cSomething we haven\u2019t seen since the tourists arrived. Follow me.\u201d Joe led Redhawk to the office as fast as his arthritis would let him. Once inside, Joe pointed to the monitor.\n\u201cI thought you would. I\u2019m guessing they were here because they\u2019re hungry. It\u2019s sad to see those kids looking for food in a dumpster, they must not know anything about magic yet. This is the only copy so don\u2019t lose it and don\u2019t let anyone off the reservation see it.\u201d Joe reached over and ejected the tape. He gave it to Redhawk who eagerly took it.\nRedhawk hid the tape under his coat before leaving the store and hopped into his Jeep. His fingers flew across the screen of his cell phone before thrusting it to his ear.\n\u201cGot it. I\u2019ll go check for feathers and be there fast.\u201d Redhawk hung up and started the Jeep. He stomped on the gas and drove back to the dumpsters. He parked and jumped out, leaving the Jeep running behind him. He looked quickly around them and found nothing, then remembered from the video the kids ran back through the trees before disappearing. He went back and searched the trees, checking the ground and the branches. Then, on a branch a few feet off the ground, he caught a glimpse of one long, blue feather. He carefully pulled it free and headed back to the Jeep. The engine raced as he peeled out of the parking lot."

This simple post by Buggy and Buddy is the easiest basic read I've found with simple ways to get started.\nNow how to get a hundred board?\nThere is an app for this which I downloaded back in her preschool days. Meh.\nNot as satisfying as working with the real thing.\nThis is where for the very first time I think it's worth a printable. I normally hate, hate, hate printables because they give me an inferiority complex of never actually getting around to print (much less laminate) the damn things. If you're like me, I promise this is an exception. Follow this link by Buggy and Buddy to a freebie template to print the grid and tiles at home.\nOkay, but I still cheated my way out of this effort.\nLuckily her math-whiz cousin happened to have one that we borrowed (for half a year, haha).\nDuring our floor time together after work, I'd bring out the hundred board and say we were going to play a sticker game. I give her an equation to solve and she marks the board with a sticker. We do one or two a night, and it went on for many nights.\nShe was mastering addition then so those were what I'd give her. Paired with our handy number sticks, it was a great way to squeeze in math practice every night without (ugh) worksheets.\nOur handy makeshift whiteboards are always ready. As are our number sticks - four years and counting.\nDepending on what you want your lovey to master, you can call out a number to practice place value for early preschoolers, all the way to a multiplication or division equation for the older child.\nYes, we do this in bed. Don't judge.\nI keep the hundred board on that clear tray with the stickers, whiteboard and marker.\nThese stickers are from her art shelves - we've had them handy since she was two.\nI kept this going for a good lazy month all the way to Valentines. One or two equations every few days or so. From simple addition mastery, I also used some days to see to whether she could handle dynamic addition.\nIt became a useful way to keep learning about my daughter. See, I grew up learning math the traditional way so I've found that sometimes I end up derailing her Montessori curriculum when I teach the way I learned. So these moments are good parenting practice for me to strike a balance of testing her, teaching her, and hanging back patiently to see how she would solve equations.\nThank goodness for number sticks as our common language!\nComing along midway point. One thing that keeps this going as play for us: she gives ME equations to do, too.\nThat way I'm not being a teacher, we're playmates.\nAnd here we are all done!\nOur spiffy new hundred board ordered from Montessori On Mars.\nFinally you can get the real stuff in the Philippines. Cost: 1,650 pesos.\nI am ridiculously excited to see how else we can keep playing and mastering math now that she's in first grade. I haven't found a lot of resources out there for elementary hundred board activities. It's a shame! I think it's still a wonderful hands-on math material to have around.\nFor a math-hater, I seem to be doing a lot of math posts! I guess this working mom is still learning a thing or two, too."

Every now and then I'd have emotional flashbacks to how I felt in the summer of 1998 and would often be angry and hurt or just feel, well, something similar to love. Why did she hurt me? Why couldn't I forget her? One time I was doing instant messages with Tammy from Toronto, Canada during one of these moments. She said,\"Why are you telling me this? Why don't you tell Ha?\" So I did in a letter. It was quite a relief to let out pain. I let out everything, including the anger. I felt like I'd finally brought some closure to the relationship.\nThe next day, September 11, after returning from the beach, I was just doing random chat as I often did (I used it to unwind) and saw a lady from Charlottesville--\"too far away\" I thought. But her profile said she wrote poetry. I loved writing poetry and was always looking for someone to trade with. So I contacted her and six hours later she replied. She looked rather cute in her photo and was very shy but we connected. This was Cathy.\nTen days shy of 24, she owned an antique shop in Ruckersville, Virginia and lived in a trailer with her parents, brother, and dog, Spike.\nAt the time I was 'burning' 22 days of excess vacation time and since I had no friends to spend time with, after chatting with Cathy for three days and phoning her, I asked if we could have a picnic together on Loft Mountain off Skyline Drive. I figured why not?\nThe next day she said okay so on September 14, I drove 2 1/2 hours to Scottsville, Virginia. By that time I had second thoughts and figured I'd just see her once. It seemed innocent but when I was ten miles from her place I had a strange premonition. Was I missing something? Was there more? I couldn't shake that but then she walked out of the trailer.\nMy first thought was,\"Okay, no more meeting women from the internet\". I didn't find her attractive at all and wondered what I'd gotten myself into. What if she liked me? My first impressions aren't always on. She had spirit and I was going to spend time with her no matter if I was attracted to her or not. She was very nice and deserved my best. We really had a great time together driving up and down Skyline drive, stopping at the overlooks, goofing around and laughing for eight hours. Before I left I was a torn...I didn't want a relationship with her but she was a very nice and fun woman and I thought we'd be good for each other. We had a chemistry and I sensed she was attracted to me. Should I see her again and risk leading her on? After being stuck in a painful seven-year marriage I didn't want to start the cycle again. I was thinking too much...I gave her a kiss and drove away. I wanted to send flowers to her work but again didn't want to tease.\nWhen I got home I went online and used a different name to talk to her, to see how she was doing. I wanted to stop talking to her so I wouldn't disappoint her but she was really relaxed about the whole thing so after an hour of posing as an Irish immigrant who \"drinks beer from the other side of the mug\" she figured it was me. We were friends--I'd found a friend."

He had been ill for a while, but had some good days when I thought there was a glimmer of hope, although I new deep down that I was facing 'that' decision none of us want to make. However, it was clear in the end, it was time to let him go, and so my vet came to the house and he passed peacefully in my arms. I had him in my life for all those 19 years, from a mischievous 'scruffyjoe' kitten, so I've been lucky he had such a long life - although it's never long enough is it? So this is by way of a tribute to the boy, and some memories of how he came into my life.\nI'd never even considered owning a pedigreee cat and had always owned moggies, many of which had been rescues, but after losing a couple of my cats on the road near where I lived, I decided enough was enough and looked into the possibility of building a cat enclosure attached to the house to keep the remaining cats safe. This was in the 1990s and I'd seen a few examples of such enclosures in a cat magazine. At the back of the magazine was a list of cat breeders and I figured that most breeders would either keep their cats indoors or they might also provide garden enclosures for their cats to enjoy the fresh air safely. As luck would have it there was a Persian breeder nearby, so I made contact with Audrey, and she kindly invited me over to see her enclosure set up. Of course I got to meet her many gorgeous Persian cats, but still never dreamed I'd own one. We kept in touch and became friends, I got my cat enclosure built and my cats were safe at last.\nFast forward to Christmas 1997 - I'd recently moved home along with my assorted moggies - the cat enclosure came too! and was reassembled pronto at the new house. I guess I must have talked a lot about meeting Audrey and her Persian cats to my mum (who sadly passed away a few years ago), because on Christmas day she presented me with an envelope, and I still have the slip of paper, with the words 'A Snushee Kitten of your Choice' (Snushee was Audrey's breeding cattery name) written on it. Now this was a huge surprise because mum didnt actually know Audrey - but somehow, she'd managed to find out enough information from me, without me realising, to seek her out, and together they plotted this surprise present for me! Mum must have managed to get enough info to get the road name, but not a number, so she'd walked up and down this road (of considerable length!) to find her, which of course she did - eventually.\nAfter Christmas I went to choose my kitten from a recent litter, and Joe caught my eye, so shortly after that I collected him - and the rest, as they say, is history! Several more Snushee Persians followed over the years, and I adopted many rescue Persians too, but it was Joe who started that passion for Persians and of course when I started my cat grooming service 16 yrs ago, he became the 'face' of the business.\nA New Website for Scruffy Joe's!"

I can't resist a raffle so bought \u00a35 worth of tickets (25 total) and was quite surprised to find I'd won quite a few of the prizes!\nFollowing on from last week, yes I'm still playing Minecraft and it's quite a lot of fun building stuff!\ncross it you have to get across the retracting pistons!\nraise so once you start you can't go back! Evil huh?\nall the way under the town and it came out here!\neven a waterfall doorway inside! Entrance path is where the arrow is!\nSaw this from \"Portal\" whilst on my travels!\nThis was built out of blocks and was HUGE!\nto see so many people turning up and leaving supportive messages etc.\nFor ages now I've kept seeing \"Minecraft\" popup here and there, either on rather weird YouTube videos or people just asking me if I play it (because they think it's something I'd like). Well I never got around to it... and now I have... and OMG IT'S SO MUCH FUN! :D Basically the world you're in (and even yourself and the other creatures) are all made up blocks so whilst it does make the graphics look rather retro, it pulls it off nicely!\nI started off in single player mode which is \"Survival\" and you have to build a house and monsters will attack so you have to mine for materials and then craft them into weapons or other such supplies (see where the name comes from?). At first I was like \"OMG!\", but it soon starts making sense because crafting is so easy and it's just really logical. Like for example if you want to make a pickaxe, you put two stick on top of each other to make the handle and then 3 stones across the top and boom that's it, you've made a pickaxe. A sword is one piece wooden handle and then two pieces of blade and it does the rest for you.\nI built a house and put a massive pillar on the roof so I'd see remember where it was!\nI made LOTS of tunnels!\nAfter I'd figured out the basics I thought it was time to go online (because multiplayer games are so much more fun!) so I Google'd for a minecraft server and the first one that came up was CityCraft. They have two different servers, one for just building where there are no enemies and another \"Survival\" server much like the single player game, but you work as a team etc. For now I'm just on the build server, but I liked playing survival so I'll probably do that at some point."

Her family, especially her sons, Princes William and Harry, have kept her memory alive.\nIn a documentary released by ITV last year, Prince Harry recalled feeling impatient and wanting to quickly get off the phone while talking to his mother.\nThe boys were at the Balmoral Castle in Scotland when they received a phone call from Diana from Paris.\nI can't necessarily remember what I said, but all I do remember is regretting for the rest of my life how short the phone call was.\nPrince Harry went on to express his pain about how that conversation went.\nIf I'd known that that was the last time I was going to speak to my mother, the things I would have said to her. Looking back at it now - it's incredibly hard. I have to deal with that for the rest of my life: not knowing that it was the last time I'd speak to my mum, how differently that conversation would have panned out if I'd had even the slightest inkling that her life was going to be taken that night.\nPrince William shared similar sentiments, saying that when they got that call, they were having fun with their cousins and did not really feel like having a long talk with their mom. They were simply in a rush to say \"goodbye, see you later.\"\nIf I'd known what was going to happen, I wouldn't have been quite so blas\u00e9 about it. That phone call sticks in my mind quite heavily.\n20 years after her death, the firefighter who was on the scene to help Princess Diana as she lay injured after the crash in a Paris tunnel has revealed the last thing the royal said.\nAccording to Sergeant Xavier Gourmelon, as the Princess of Wales was dealing with the shock from the accident, she said, \"My God, what\u2019s happened?\" This turned out to be the last thing she said before she passed away.\nDealing with the loss of a parent is never easy. And in this case, Prince Charles did not just have to cope with losing his wife, he also had to help his sons get through their grief.\nAnd according to William and Harry, Prince Charles did a great job.\nOne of the hardest things for a parent to have to do is to tell your children that your other parent has died... He was the one out of two left, and he tried to do his best and to make sure that we were protected and looked after. But you know, he was going through the same grieving process as well.\nClearly, this family found comfort in one another, and the brothers have shared a pretty close bond, which has lasted up to this day.\nREAD ALSO: Since There's A Princess Diana, Why Isn't There A Princess Kate Middleton?"

They never said anything about 28 days until a few weeks ago.\nThe chap i spoke to made no sense whatsoever From the start of the call he tried to confuse me or so I was thinking. He asked me for the 4th and 3rd character of my telephone banking pin no. Once I'd figured out what he was on about and we got through with no hitches he started to tell me it will be 6-8 weeks for payment. So naturally I asked why, he said it was because I set up a new claim. Again I'd explained this wasn' a new claim as I'd sent off the acceptance letter and I'd Been offered a large sum of money. He was adamant that it was 6-8 weeks. After he did some digging on his computer he then found my acceptance letter and said it had been recieved on the 17th of February and only been scanned in on the 3rd of March. I asked how a letter that they had received on the 17th of Feb only got looked at on the 3rd of March? He said it was put to the bottom of the pile.\nrang the same number the next day. The lady I spoke to wasn' really that well knowledged with ppi and had to pop me on hold.

If the item isn\u2019t picked up within 30 days, it will be Returned to Sender.\nDo I need to check for mail/package(s) if I do not get a notification?\nNo, you will only be notified when you have mail/package(s).\nWhat if I want to check for mail/package(s) anyway?\nYou can. When you swipe your Student ID Card at the Mail Center KIOSK, you will be informed whether any mail/package(s) have been received for you to pick up.\nIn addition, if you were previously issued a mailbox key, you can still utilize your key to check your mailbox. You would still need to utilize the KIOSK and proceed to the counter for packages.\nCan I have someone else pick up my mail and/or packages?\nYou can notify the Mail Center that someone else will be picking up your items. However, the Mail Center will not be held liable for any mail or package that you authorize someone else to pick up.

                            "text": "Abi K. asks: What does the postal service do when a package is mailed with no valid recipient\u2019s address and no return address?\nThis seems like a pretty cut and dry statement that leaves very little room for interpretation. However, there\u2019s always an exception to the rule and in the case of undeliverable mail that exception is things like periodicals, which are deemed to have little to no value after a certain point due to their timely nature and will be disposed of accordingly. That said, publishers can request to have such items returned to them if they so wish.\nSo what about the case of mail that is undeliverable and happens to have no visible or legible return address? The Postal Service has had measures in place to deal with these so-called \u201cdead letters\u201d almost since the service first began in earnest in the 1700s with the awesomely named position of Inspector of Dead Letters, being created by an act of Congress way back in 1777. The first Dead Letter Office, on the other hand, wouldn\u2019t exist until 1825, when the sheer amount of dead mail necessitated the creation of a dedicated service to deal with it all.\nIn any event, as noted on their website, the Mail Recovery Center generally doesn\u2019t accept anything worth less than about $25 or something that can\u2019t reasonably be traced back to someone like keys, cosmetics and food. In this case, the items will either be recycled, disposed of or in some cases, donated to charity.\nOf course, exceptions can and will be made, but this is handled on a case-by-case basis. For example, if an undeliverable letter or package contains something that clearly has sentimental value (such as photographs or, in one case, postal worker Lori Ferguson-Costa had the pleasure of processing a dead-package containing a jar that in turn contained a placenta) , it will be processed to try to track down the original sender or intended recipient, despite it having no real monetary value.\nYou might at this point be wondering what about if they find money and despite their best efforts they can\u2019t track down who sent the letter or where to send it to? It will simply be tallied up and given to the US treasury.\nSo what goes into the \u201cprocessing\u201d step? First, a Mail Recovery Clerk has to physically open the letters and packages to discern exactly what they contain, making people in this position just about the only individuals in the US legally allowed to open another person\u2019s mail without it being a federal crime. As you can imagine, this means security is tight and everything the clerks find has to be meticulously recorded and noted down to stop someone just walking out of the building with a pocketful of other people\u2019s stuff.\nBeyond just opening the packages and letters, the mail clerks in question will go to fairly extensive lengths to try and return or deliver dead mail. In one case noted in a Smithsonian piece on the day in the life of one of these workers, the worker at the center of the article, Vera, opened a package with no identifying marks whatsoever on the outside, but managed to use a phone number contained inside to ultimately track down the package\u2019s original owner.\nIn another case, the aforementioned postal worker Lori Ferguson-Costa got a call from a woman who\u2019d recently had her baby die of SIDS. (If you\u2019re curious, see: What Causes Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.) The woman, who was in tears at the time, explained that she\u2019d mailed a photograph of her baby that she didn\u2019t have any copies of, the last one taken before the baby\u2019s death, but the recipient (the grandmother) never got it. Lori then got a detailed description of what was in the photograph and after a pretty extensive search around the Mail Recovery Office manged to find it, despite going off of only the woman\u2019s description of the picture.\nEssentially, any clue whatsoever, even small ones, in the package will be followed up on until the clerk manages to find out where the package was intended to go or who sent it.\nAs for how long this all takes, the usual amount of time the Mail Recovery Office will hold things varies and is handled on a case-by-case basis depending on the item and the clerk\u2019s preference. For example, if the item in question is clearly worth a lot of money or seems like it probably holds significant sentimental value like a wedding dress or jewellery, the Mail Recovery Office will hold onto it for upwards of a year (and in some cases even longer, such as a jar containing the cremated remains of one W.C.G. McLeod who lived from 1891 to 1977, which postal worker Vera stated was there when she got the job and she intends to keep it around until she retires, hoping someone will claim it).\nHowever, since it just isn\u2019t feasible for the Mail Recovery Office to hold onto something indefinitely, in the vast majority of cases, after every avenue to return something is explored and they\u2019ve held onto an item long enough for someone to miss it and file a claim, they are left with no choice but to sell it at in a bulk auction, the profits of which are funneled back to the Postal Service.\nSo with all their efforts, how successful are they at bringing dead mail back to life? According to official figures, they are able to deliver or return 68% of the dead mail \u201cwith obvious value\u201c, a figure which drops to a lower, but not insignificant 43% when you factor in all dead mail. When you consider that only about 0.05% of mail is deemed \u201cundeliverable\u201d in the first place, that\u2019s a pretty remarkable overall delivery rate.\nYour story says, \u201cthe mail clerks go to fairly extensive lengths to try and return or deliver dead mail.\u201d Umm\u2026 not true.\nI shipped four cartons of new books (88 total) that were lost. Before they were even supposed to show up at their destination, they were sold at the USPS Auction \u2013 within 10 days of being shipped. Not only did they charge us $100 to for a service not delivered, they made $440 off my books, which haven\u2019t even been released to the public yet. And the guys who bought the books put them on the internet and made $3,100, again before the book was rolled out to the public.\nWe found the company selling the books, who agreed to give them back to the USPS if they could get their auction money back. The USPS refused to give us our $100 for the unshipped books and refused to even call the company that had bought them at auction. They also refused to give us the $440 they made at auction. It made all the major news stations in Denver.\nSo let\u2019s not paint the USPS \u201cRecovery\u201d Center as a bunch of good guys. It\u2019s a classic extension of the bureaucracy we\u2019ve all come to know and despise \u2013 the USPS. \u201cIt\u2019s not my job\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s their motto.\nGood article. What happens to letters that are undeliverable? Not packages and other merchandise. As an aside, what do they do with letters to Santa and the Easter Bunny, etc? Just Curious.\n\u201cthe mail clerks go to fairly extensive lengths to try and return or deliver dead mail.\u201d Yeah right!!!! I filled out a Mail Recover Center Search Request form at my local post office Sept 12th, 2014. I received a package from one of my best friends that was supposed to contain a birthday present for myself. It was opened and only a card was in the mailer. After talking to my girlfriend found out it was a tarot card deck purchased for me in New Orleans. I contacted the Atlanta office after my Mail Recovery Center Search Request was submitted. I informed them it was a Tarot deck in a gift bag with the word Hex on it per my girlfriend who sent it. She also filled a request out on her end. You know what I was told when I finally got in contact with someone? Why didn\u2019t I have a photograph of the gift & I had a very slim chance of getting my gift because my description wasn\u2019t descriptive enough! What a bunch of crooks. I\u2019m sure some employee opened the gift and stole it anyway. I\u2019ve now received a birthday package from my Dad for my daughter that was sent priority, arrived 2 weeks late, opened and money missing. Lovely.\nWord to the wise, always check your return address no matter WHAT.\nI had a fairly valuable ebay package sent to the address they specified, only they didnt include their apartment number, soooo it was returned. I called a day after it was returned and they said they think it had already gone to the dead mail center\u2026WTF??!! more efficient than the mail in the first place! I figured it would be there for at least a week. So now it is lost, with a request placed to find it.\nHi, I\u2019m trying to contact Mr. Smallwood. please email me \u2013 love to discuss how you wrote this story!"

HP 34c has a full complement of scientific and math functions, it was the first to offer root finding and numerical integration.\nThe Solve function could find real roots for any equation which could be expressed in the form f(x) = 0. To use the Solve function, the user keyed in a subroutine to evaluate f(x) which left the value in the X register. The user then entered two initial guesses to give the calculator a starting range and then pressed Solve and the label of the subroutine. The HP 34c calculator would then evaluate f(x) until it found the first root. Additional roots could be found by entering different initial guesses. The calculator would display an error if there were no roots. Before calling the subroutine, Solve would fill the entire stack with the value of X. Because pops copied the top of the stack down, this allowed X, to be retrieved from the stack as many times as the subroutine required.\nNumerical integration was also found on the HP 34c. As with the Solve function, the user keyed in a subroutine to evaluate f(x) which left the value in the X register. The user entered the lower and then upper limit of integration and then pressed the integrate key followed by the subroutine label.\nThe factorial function (x!) had appeared on many previous HP calculators, but on the HP 34c, for the first time, the factorial key really calculated Gamma(x+1). For positive integers, this was the same as a factorial, but the Gamma of any number could also be calculated by subtracting 1 and pressing x!. The HP-34C also included a full complement of scientific and mathematical functions.\nThe HP 34c had 70 lines of permanent program space. As programs grew larger than 70 lines, registers were converted into additional program space starting at R.9 and ending at R0. There were 20 registers (not including the I register) and each register converted into 7 lines of program space. Thus with all registers (except I) converted to program space, there were 210 program line."

See Ya!!!! \ud83d\ude00 Lilyana C.\nI played the game pentago and at first I was frustrated because I couldn\u2019t find a way to win, but going towards the end I started getting the hang of it and won 2 out of 3 times. It was a very fun game to play. Also the turning of the game board was part of the reason I got frustrated and annoyed while playing, but in general it was fun.\nI thought the Pentago game was a little confusing at first, but after my first round, I found this game required a lot of thinking and concentration. The second time I played I managed to win and found that having to spin the board to complete your turn, made the game a little harder. I managed to win 2 out of 3 times. Overall, I thought this was a cool game.\nI thought this game was hard because the computer kept on moving my balls the way I didn\u2019t want it to go because I almost got the 5.\nThis game looked really easy at first but then I played my first game against a computer and lost. The spinning of the boards made it really confusing but then I came up with a strategy to beat the computer. Overall I thought the game was really fun. Honestly it was like a really confusing game of tick-tack-toe.\nPentago was hard at first but then I tried to trick the computer by projecting where the turn would land me and one 4 of the 5 times after that. It is a great and challenging game. Really gets you thinking.\nI thought this game was very fun and it felt like I was playing tic tac toe.\ni thought that video was really cool even though i wouldn\u2019t sit and put all those domino\u2019s together!"

He told me that I asked him, I handed him the pad and the pen and told him to write down everything that I said. When I looked at the pad there was a song that I actually have recorded and a scripture on it. The scripture was the story of the prodigal son. I read it and I thought it was so close to my life. I didn\u2019t understand where it came from or why it came to me. The following day the same thing happened. Three days in a row the exact same thing happened. But it was three different stories and they were all stories where I just looked at them like \u201cwow\u201d. That happened for three days in a row, constantly. But mind you, he was a complete atheist. He didn\u2019t believe in God. He felt like science is the reason why everything happens.\nI thought he was crazy at first. I really thought he was crazy. He came to know the Lord. He was actually holding a bible study a lot of the times before I left.

Through an ornate bay window draped in shadow and flanked by slender pine trees, a man can be seen counting money. His mustached mouth moves silently as he plucks packets of bills out of a brown leather briefcase, flips through them hurriedly, and lays them down on the beige couch cushion next to him. From time to time he casts a furtive glance over his shoulder toward the front door, but most of his attention remains fixed on the bundles of cash in his hands.\nA fierce north wind picks up suddenly, the pine trees outside the window wave back and forth, and something metallic, perhaps a garbage can lid, crashes to the ground. The man jumps up from his spot on the couch and rushes to the window to see if someone is outside. After surveying the yard for a minute or two, he scurries into the foyer and checks the front door to make sure it is still locked. Apparently satisfied, he lets out a long breath through pursed lips, and returns to the couch and the piles of cash.\nSeveral minutes pass without any further commotion. Then, just as the man reaches into the case for the last packet of crisp, tightly wrapped hundred-dollar bills, there is a sharp clicking of heels on the front porch and then the unmistakable sound of a key grinding into the lock.\nThe man\u2019s head snaps around to stare at the door, and he scrambles to stuff the cash back into the briefcase before the newcomer enters the house. In his haste, he drops several of the packets onto the floor and has to bend down and fumble blindly for them even as his eyes remain glued to the front door.\nHe doesn\u2019t make it. He is still clutching three or four bundles of bills in his hands when a pale, freckle-faced redhead glides out of the black night into the lamp-lit foyer. She is wearing a shimmering green evening gown, stiletto heels, and a string of pearls around her throat, and her delicate china features bear a preoccupied and distraught expression. Even so, as she drops her keys back into her tiny designer purse and takes a few steps into the living room, her flashing blue eyes instantly light on the cash that the man is trying to conceal in his fists and the leather briefcase he is holding closed with his elbows.\nShould You Consider Home Security Cameras for Your House?"

Along its sides was a Native American motif reminiscent of days long-past. Its gold trim shined reflections of low-light sconces in the walls, through a room half-in shadow.\nThe old man\u2019s cheeks dimpled with a smile. His brows, thick and protruding like some ancient, oriental master, curled upward with the corners of his eyes.\nThe old kook smiled again, straightened. He stepped \u2019round the desk, his fingertips traced his path along its glossed mahogany, but came to rest as he leaned against its far side with the box at his left. He crossed his arms.\nHe raised an eyebrow. The young man nodded once with a squinted eye as his pungent cigarette came to a rest on the arm of the chair. The old kook gave a chuckle, paced back behind the desk, and sat to lean over the box. The young man\u2019s eyes followed, fell downward only to focus on the box.\nThe young man\u2019s eyes darted from the box long enough to convey their bemusement, but he remained silent. The old man\u2019s face sank with the sadness of a life lost to hardship, watched the other\u2019s eyes return to the box.\nThe young man\u2019s brow rose as his cigarette flared. Its ash grew longer, but the hand that held it did not stir. The old man had long since slipped away into recollection, his eyes no longer focused on the man before him. It was just as well; the young man was transfixed by the box, its vibrant trim a twinkle in his eyes.\nThe young man\u2019s face formed a question as if to ask \u201cSo, what,\u201d but his eyes were enthralled by the box.\nHe sank back with a moment of silence, as if waiting to bridge a mental gap. The young man simply watched the box, his mind reeling at its closed lid, while nicotine stained his fingers and the chair\u2019s armrest.\nThe old man let his fingers rest once-more upon the top-edges of the box. The young man\u2019s brow showed a moment of irritation that was alleviated by the kook\u2019s next words.\nThe old man\u2019s finger-tips slid along the box\u2019s forward edges to meet behind it. They interlocked with one another, settled atop the desk. The young man\u2019s curiosity piqued, he sat forward in anticipation paying no mind to the cigarette ash that shattered and drifted to the floor.\nHe swallowed, watched the young man\u2019s enthralled eyes; they barely moved, focused on the sole thought of what might be inside. He knew his voice was but whispers on the wind in a mind of thoughts that had no place for him.\nThe box slid to the edge of the desk with a nudge. The young man, at the edge of his seat, stumbled to reach. He took a deep breath, recollected himself, his mind taken by the vast riches that might be inside. He exhaled, heart racing, and place his hands on either side of the lid in ceremony. His eyes reeled with giddy at what might be inside.\nHe lifted the lid slowly at first, not daring to peer in until its innards were fully exposed. He felt the lid meet the final resistance that stayed it, tilted his head downward to take in his prize."

An overhead set of lights washed his alabaster skin clean of details until she got close. A thick bunch of tan folders were set neatly on top of the black surface.\n\u201cAdmiral Black, Sir.\u201d Becca refrained from saluting when she reached the far end of the table; she learned in the beginning they didn\u2019t do that here.\nObsidian eyes showing no whites, only an expanse of flat black set into white skin and topped with equally under-pigmented short hair, regarded her without expression. By some trick of the light, the immortal, soulless creature appeared strained. Could it be? She shook off the thought as impossible.\nHis towering six-foot-four frame stationed at the head of the table was even more daunting when she sidled up the table to take her usual seat on his right. She tried not to be obvious as she scanned the room for Michael.\n\u201cI have asked Michael to give us a few minutes alone, if you don\u2019t mind. We have not had the opportunity to speak without his company for some time.\u201d Tapping a long white finger on his pointed chin, he appeared to think for a minute. \u201cNot since you returned from the hospital, I believe.\u201d Those flat black eyes turned toward her and his thin lips tightened into what might have been a smile. On him it was more of a grimace. Then, gracefully, he folded and took his seat.\nThat simple act had her heart racing. Becca had never seen the man sit before, much less smile. It freaked her out even more than his hovering aloofness. Keeping herself from making direct eye contact for long enough for him to manipulate her mind, she glanced to his nose and back every few seconds.\nIf the admiral wasn\u2019t the admiral, Becca might have been tempted to laugh. It wasn\u2019t like she\u2019d had a choice in her place here. Once Black decided he wanted someone that was it. It didn\u2019t matter whether she liked it there or not. One thing was for sure, if she had to be around the chilling admiral as often as she had her previous commanding officers, she would have had a breakdown or at least developed a nervous tic or ten by now. Fortunately, she had Michael acting as a buffer between them. While that would have bothered her in her old unit in the Navy, it didn\u2019t so much now. The less time she spent with Black the better, and Michael was her immediate supervisor. That was another can of worms entirely and not one she could open while she was with Black. One stress case was enough, thank you."

He has written many books that have helped millions around the world so his wisdom will live on. He was my close friend and soul family and I greatly miss him. However, my experience with him, one week after his death October 19, 2012, made me acutely aware of how we help each other--even if we're not currently living in the same dimension.\nI was heart broken when I learned Andreas passed on. I couldn't stop sobbing and couldn't imagine him not being on this planet as him. I was also worried about his wife since they were so closely linked in all aspects of each other's lives.\nOne week after his death, I had an acupuncture appointment with gifted practitioner Joe, and set my intention that my grief surrounding Andreas would lessen. I silently asked that Andreas help me with the loss of his human self since I knew his wisdom would live on in the higher realms. I saw his Spirit appear and gratefully acknowledged his presence. He showed me his earthly home that I had previously visited when he was alive. He brought us to the back patio overlooking a beautiful nature scene. We sat down in two wooden chairs so we could have a conversation. He addressed my concern about his beautiful wife and told me that she would be okay and that a mutual friend would be instrumental in her healing process. We then came back to my present day time and he walked towards my head as I lay on the acupuncture table so he could work on me as I requested. I then conked out.\nI still see him around me helping with some of my clients. I also know that he's watching over his beloved wife making sure all is well with her."

Both Tsunade and Kakashi take it as their mission to break Iruka out of his bad habit.\n\u201cTwo.\u201d Kakashi discarded into the pile and slipped the new cards Azuma handed him into his hand. His luck was running foul tonight. So far the best he\u2019d managed was two pair and that was a world better than the cards staring back at him now.\n\u201cAnyone want a beer?\u201d Anko called from Genma\u2019s kitchen.\nKakashi raised a hand. His fingers closed around the beer that smacked into his palm seconds later. \u201cNice throw,\u201d he complimented without looking up and sighed. \u201cFold.\u201d He dropped his cards onto the table. There went another twenty.\nGenma and Raidou looked up as a soft knock sounded from the door, almost drowned out by the pouring rain.\n\u201cI fold.\u201d Genma tossed his cards onto the table as he stood.\nKakashi glanced surreptitiously around the room, wondering who they were missing. All the regulars were present, scattered around Genma\u2019s coffee table. Kurenai sat between Kakashi and Azuma, with Anko watching from the couch. Raidou sat on the opposite side of the table.\nThe door opened. Genma\u2019s body blocked sight of the visitor. Soft words were exchanged and then Genma moved aside, ushering his visitor in. Kakashi blinked. He almost didn\u2019t recognize Iruka as he walked in. The scar across Iruka-sensei\u2019s nose gave him away, but that was where the similarities ended. Loose, wet black hair hid most of Iruka-sensei\u2019s face, clinging to his cheeks. Iruka was drenched, his clothes dripping water onto Genma\u2019s hardwood floor.\nSo I found this through the LJ Kakashi/Iruka archives and I really like the first chapter. I was wondering if you plan on finishing it.\nI\u2019m planning to finish it this December, along with the Kakashi version of the KakaIru Christmas story."

                            "text": "Sarah smoked her cigarette in the chair beside our bedroom window. Occasionally she wanted to make love in the morning, but more often she woke before me and sat wrapped in a sheet, blowing smoke-prayers to the heavens. She gazed at the trees outside, but her mind\u2019s eye was watching something else. Once, when I asked her about it, she told me she was thinking about the best moment of her life \u2014 a sparkling memory like the champagne she had the night she gave her law school valedictorian speech. She was the best, and everybody knew it.\nI wished that she would quit the firm. \u201cWe have enough of everything, except time,\u201d I said.\nEvery time I heard her say that I wanted to yell at her. \u201cWhat happens then? The work never stops!\u201d I never did, though. Instead, I fantasized that I could take her into my arms and in one fleeting moment when she clutched the sheets and sighed my name, she would really be there with me, the way she was when we were students. Then, every morning, I woke up to the reality that we dreamed about different things now.\nSarah glanced over, almost imperceptibly \u2014 enough to see I was awake.\nThere were fine creases forming at the corners of her eyes, but her pale skin stretched tightly over the curve of her back, the facets of her spine like a train of pearls in cream. The spring of our twenties had come and gone, but that younger, happier woman was still there. I could see her, in the taper of Sarah\u2019s hands and the curve of her neck when she read the newspaper on Sunday morning, tapping her fingers on the coffee mug.\nThe next time Sarah spoke was from inside the closet. \u201cRemember, we have dinner reservations at seven tonight. Don\u2019t wear that maroon shirt, again, okay?\u201d Her tone was instructional. If she was irritated, it never showed more than a little.\nIn my bare feet I spoon-fed the coffee maker and rubbed the stubble on my face, in rebellion against the sun. Sarah emerged in a navy skirt suit and coat of makeup, taking up her mug in one hand and flipping document pages with the other. On her way out the door, she left the coffee behind on the kitchen table, the forgotten remainder growing cold in the bottom. I poured it out and sat down at my desk for the day.\nWhen Sarah came home I was clean-shaven, wearing a soft blue shirt with a tweed blazer. She looked me over silently and nodded her approval. She changed efficiently, and in brilliant turquoise and stocking feet, she padded across the floor.\nShe seemed not to hear me, and I suppose it didn\u2019t matter. The ones she chose for herself looked stunning, and we both knew it.\nSarah drove us to the restaurant, briefing me on recent developments in her firm, in preparation for the inevitable shop talk that would arise. She was ambitious, but not inconsiderate.\nI murmured an acknowledgement, enough to demonstrate comprehension but not so much as to disturb her flow.\nI forgot most of the evening as soon as it happened. Introductions, salad, business, steak, wine, theatre, cheesecake, coffee. Statements made by all parties evaporated into the air and when the table was cleared, there was nothing left but a full belly and the vague impression that a connection had been made.\nAt the end of the night, Sarah got in the passenger side of the car and collapsed against the headrest, handing me her keys without another word.\nI pulled into the garage and we entered the house in darkness. Sarah removed her high heels, and threw them in a corner. \u201cThank God,\u201d she sighed. She climbed the stairs wearily and flopped down on the edge of the bed. I unzipped her dress, and she accepted her night clothes from me with quiet thanks.\nI climbed into bed beside her. I remembered the countless nights I faced her back in the dim light, tracing her neck as it sloped into her shoulder, sprinkled with her fine blonde hair, watching as she fell asleep. How many days, like this, had vanished while she thought about other things?\nAlbert Allen is a psychiatrist working in Toronto."

She wasn\u2019t sure when or how, but he was going to do it.\nThere\u2019s no putting it off any further.\nBarbara stirred the melted butter and beaten eggs over and over in the pan.\nI will have to talk to Dad and Jeff today about Sarah. And I guess I\u2019ll have to talk to Sarah about it too.\nThe eggs fluffed up as she continued to stir them.\nI wonder if we can keep her without legally adopting her.\nThat sounds way too much like stealing. Plus, I don\u2019t know anything about her parents. They might still be out there, looking for her. I should make an honest effort to find them. But how do I go about that?\nIt\u2019s not like Sarah is a lost dog. I can\u2019t just put up a Found Little Girl ad in the classifieds. That just seems gross somehow. Not to mention, it might attract the wrong kind of responders.\nI could call the police. That seems to be a sensible starting point.\nBarbara shut off the stove and plated her food. She carried her plate to the table.\nSarah sat on the other side of the table. She was reading her book while devouring a full bowl of Oatliest Oatly O\u2019s cereal.

The table had been emptied, and Kien asked me for a cup of water (I thought it was for him to drink). I gave it to him. The water ended up in on the water table.\nClimbing through/in/out of the Barbie kitchen - and sometimes getting stuck in the process.\nFeeding each other homemade biscuits.\nBesides Jessica, whom Kien still mentioned today and wanted to watch video clips of her, his new found \"best friend\" was Tess.\nSarah was on it. Kien wanted it badly. BADLY. He behaved like it was the end of the world. I enticed him to playing on a ride-on car instead, but do you think he wanted to do that? So after much commotion and refusal for anything else other than the rocking horse, Sarah, being the sweet girl she is got off the horse to play on the ride-on car. Guess what? Yip, I don't even have to say it. It happened TWICE in a row. Same scenario played out all over again. The boy just wants to have his cake and eat it too. He learnt pretty quickly (or maybe not) that he couldn't have his own way all the time.\nWe were out the door by 8am to get to the markets and back in time for Kien to have a nap, which is BNE time was around 9:30am. It was sunny (and hot), and we all had our glasses on.\nOne worn wonky, the other upside-down.\nKien was hot and bothered, and boy can you tell.\nSarah, however was a cool as a cucumber.\nHe perked up again after he was able to get out of the stroller while we sat down for a coffee. It turns out that in Brisbane they make a large flat white the same as a latte with no foam. It surprised me when I ordered my latte and the barista said \"so you want a flat white then\" and I said \"no, a latte is different to a flat white because it has more milk and I want my latte with no foam\", and she looked at me funny. Yes, embarrassingly I told the coffee lady how to make a coffee. It wasn't until I questioned Justine and Bianca that they told me the small bit of trivia.\nWe got home and Kien went straight into the cot. 2 hour naps are the best. Peace and quiet."

I leaned casually against the casing, one hand toying idly with the green curtains my mother had so lovingly made for me.\n\u201cGreen to go with your eyes!\u201d she\u2019d teased.\nI smiled to myself, but then grimaced inwardly as I heard my fathers racking cough in the next door room. I heard the soft patter of my mother\u2019s footsteps as she rushed to his side, acting as nurse. Father had been terribly sick for the last week, with a raging fever and bone-rattling cough. I tentatively walked into the next room and regarded my mothers bent form for a time.\n\"Is he alright?\u201d I asked softly.\nShe whirled around to face me, her bronze- colored hair plastered to her forehead. \u201cHe\u2019s fine, Edward. I-I think he might actually be getting better!\u201d The ghost of a smile appeared on her white face as she regarded me.\nI folded my arms across my chest and sighed. Mother had been telling me this same lie\u2026she always wanted to protect me, to shield me from all the evil in the world.\nThe smile disappeared from her face and she sunk into a chair. \u201cDo you really want to know the truth?\u201d she asked warily.\nMy blood ran cold, the Spanish Influenza\u2026the deadly disease which had been seeping through Chicago\u2019s streets like silent death. My fingers tightened on the doorway until my knuckles turned white.\n\u201cWha-what?\u201d I asked shakily, fighting to regain my composure.\nMother got up swiftly and stretched to put her arms around my neck.\n\u201cEdward, you need to go call the hospital for me, sweetheart,\u201d she said slowly.\nI disentangled myself from her embrace and walked slowly towards our small phone. The hospital\u2026the hospital. I took a step closer towards the phone, but then it felt like my muscles were locked. A searing pain began to rip through my head, and I put shaky fingers to my forehead. It was burning hot.\nI felt my legs collapse beneath me, and felt the cool of the wooden floors underneath my cheek.\n\u201cEDWARD!\u201d I heard Mother scream.\nThen my world went black.\nGhosts and shapes, flitted through my vision like specters. A pain that seemed to weaken my muscles every time I gasped for air\u2026 My mother\u2019s fevered touch and the soothing, deep voice of a man. I would sometimes see his face through my hazy eyes\u2026a painfully-beautiful face with topaz irises. I wanted my mother\u2026I remembered screaming her name as a fresh spasm of pain overtook me in waves.\nThe beautiful and strange man, his touch like ice against my fevered skin.\n\u201cHold on, Edward\u2026\u201d he\u2019d say in his clear and mesmerizing voice.\n\u201cSave him! Save him!\u201d I heard my mother\u2019s voice call as it echoed through my brain.\nThen there was nothing but the pain.\nA guttural scream tore loose from my throat as fire enveloped my entire body. I heard the man\u2019s soothing voice, but I could think of nothing but the terrible fire. I should have been dead by now\u2026I craved the sweet release of death\u2026anything but this. I could hear my heart beating frantically, as if it would stop beating soon.\nThe pain spun around in my head, but instead it revolved around an image of a girl. She had pale skin, dark hair and beautiful, soulful brown eyes. Her expression was calm and I strained to focus on her\u2026only her.\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Edward. It\u2019ll be over soon.\u201d Her voice was like spring water and I basked in its radiant light.\nMy head thrashed wildly and I felt cool hands restraining me. I focused on my savior as the pain reached a blinding point. She stayed with me throughout my agony\u2026the only light in my darkness. I heard my breathing becoming short and rapid and my heart pounded in my chest.\n\u201cI love you. Wait for me\u2026\u201d Then my savior faded."

Certain types of music can provide a soothing experience for your pets. The positive effects of these soothing sounds are confirmed by both animal psychologists and pet owners. The sound of the harp can be exceptionally relaxing for your pets. There are several artists that provide these recordings for your pets. One is Aliana Boone. She says that the harp is considered to be one of the most healing instruments next to the human voice. Boone conducted a study of her own. In 2000, she performed for hospitalized canines at the Florida Veterinary clinic. The hour long performances immediately began to the dogs heart rate, anxiety and respiration.\nIf your dog or cat is stressed because of a particular situation or maybe, they are high strung by nature, try soothing harp music. If it doesn\u2019t calm them down right away, it will certainly calm you.\nIt\u2019s a 60s and 70\u2019s weekend on Edgewater Gold Radio-\u2013keep us on all weekend long and enjoy the all of the music you remember.

When we arrived at Just Fur Pets, one of the local rescue groups was there having a dog adoption day. Usually when there are lots of dogs and people around, Ray is SO happy, but this time he was oddly subdued.\n\"Wow,\" said Mirella, the owner of the daycare, \"Ray is really behaving himself today. Good BOY Ray.\" Ray was standing with his leash slack, his brow furrowed. Usually he's straining at the end of the leash trying to get some shopping done, or if there are dogs and people around, trying to meet and greet.\nI stood talking to the rescue folks for a bit. They were exclaiming how Ray looked exactly like a dog that they had adopted out the week before, except \"Larry\" was a tricolor (they thought maybe a Treeing Walker Hound). Everybody loved Larry and his foster mother really missed him. Ray stood still, looking concerned.\nWe went to the back of the store to pick up a bag of food and then to the check out, Ray continued to be a good boy. Then it dawned on me that maybe Ray had spent many Saturdays at adoption days like this one when he was at SQ Rescue and living with his foster mom. Maybe he thought I was going to give him away. We left the store, Ray trailing me a bit. \"Don't worry Ray,\" I said, \"I'm not going to give you away.\" I kissed him on the top of the head. Ray jumped up in to the car and we headed home.\nWhen we got there, we did some gardening. Ray helped me dig up a rhododendron that had been mostly uprooted in one of the snowstorms (well, technically, Ray dug it up again after I moved it to a new spot, then went back to the place that I had removed it from and enlarged the hole enough so that he could lay in it.) Every time I moved to work in a different part of the yard, Ray got up from wherever he was, and moved with me, lying down within ten feet of where I was working. I thought maybe he was still worried about being \"let go\", so I went over to where he was flopped over on his side. Ray rolled, exposing his underside for a belly rub. I stroked his belly and whispered to him \"Don't worry Ray, I'll keep you 'till the day I die or the day you die, whichever comes first.\" I don't know if I imagined it, but I swear I could see the tension leave my blind hound. I'm sure he believed me."

I didn&apos;t want to talk to Steve. I wanted to crawl out the window and run.

Steve was sitting on the couch, Tony was standing at the bar, a few others strewn about. Everyone looking nervous and sad. I felt like I had just walked into a room full of people at a wake. Everyone mourning and I had no idea who they were mourning. I scanned the room, he wasn&apos;t there. I knew it. I wouldn&apos;t see him again. I didn&apos;t even need Steve to tell me. I knew it.\nSteve noticed me and waved me over. I sat down.The room got quiet. Tony didn&apos;t say a word, not even a sarcastic comment.

Unless you WALK him in the rain, then he loves it, but don't ever think of putting him outside on his lead in the rain. That's just not happening. He chases the mailman (he's so stereotypical). He howls with the fire whistle (we live across the street from a first station so he howls. a. lot.). And he's a lab that can't catch, won't retrieve, and doesn't like the water. But he's a doll and we wouldn't want him any other way. Just look at that face, how emotive is he? He's clearly concerned that a. I'm leaving. or b. I'm going to make him come inside. He is the king of furrowed brow when he's worried. I'm pretty sure he's a human (at least in a past life) and I'm convinced he understands 98% of what we say but has selective hearing when it comes to commands. Anyway, he's awesome.

I remember a song (I think it was by Dion, but don\u2019t hold me to that,) that was called \u201cThe Wanderer.\u201d Well, I\u2019ve changed the name, and now I\u2019m \u201cThe Worrier.\u201d I know I wasn\u2019t always this way, so it could be a change in my mental attitude, or maybe it\u2019s just old age creeping in. Whatever, I seem to worry about little things these days.\nLast week, I worried because my SIL said they\u2019d hit traffic after they left our house. Would he be all right with the two little guys in the car? If someone is flying, I fret about the plane ride. When my family goes anywhere on vacation, I stew until they\u2019re home safely. If one of my children is doing something special at work, my thoughts are: make them be ok, let them come through it in good shape.\nAs I said, I wasn\u2019t always a worrier. I rarely thought about danger, I didn\u2019t give a second thought to traveling, and nothing really bothered me. Now, I\u2019m not myself unless there\u2019s a furrowed brow and a figurative wringing of hands. My kids laugh at me, and they, too, know I used to be a lot more carefree. \u201cStop worrying. Everything\u2019s fine,\u201d is there constant refrain. My husband, though, really gets annoyed when I start.\nExample: my boys are supposed to come for dinner tonight. There\u2019s a small snow event coming our way. Where does my mind go? Straight into worry mode. I texted them, yesterday, to see if they wanted to change the day to tomorrow. They probably laughed when they read it. But they\u2019re fine with traveling tonight. My husband kept reminding me that the roads would be plowed and salted, and it\u2019s only an inch that\u2019s predicted. Just to prove my point, I reminded him of the huge chain-reaction crash that happened on Sunday not far from here. He calmed me down by reminding me that it was a flash freeze, people were going too fast, and it was totally different.\nDoes all of that explanation calm me down? Not a bit! I\u2019ll be a nervous wreck this evening, and then I\u2019ll worry some more until they\u2019re back in their homes. Another interesting thing: I really could be concerned with the world situation, the threat of terrorists, or the decline of our society. That really doesn\u2019t bother me at all. I adopt a qu\u00e9 sera, sera attitude with the big issues. It\u2019s only the little ones that involve my family that concern me.\nI think I\u2019ve become my mother, who was a worrier. My dad was a panic freak, but my mother silently stewed. I guess those genes have finally shown themselves. There\u2019s nothing I can do about myself, so I\u2019ll just have to accept it. Now, I have to go make onion soup and a dessert. I hope I don\u2019t burn the house down.\nlook at it instead as what a caring person you are\u2026.and don't worry about it!!! hehehe, pun intended!!\nthe official name of the orchid on my blog is \"just add ice\" and i purchased it at stop and shop. with the coupon i had i think it was 10 bucks!!!!\nLove your punnies!! I'm going to look into those orchids -- if they're that carefree, I'd love them!\nThat's the thing -- I'm always getting these images of 'what if...' and they aren't good ones!

AGL has promised to end gas mining in Camden by 2023. Residents want them shut down now.\nThe NSW government has said that gas wells cannot be drilled within two kilometres of homes, but it is happy for Landcom, the government's own developer, to sell house and land packages within a few hundred metres of major gasfields.\nThe tour kicked off with a visit to Mount Annan where AGL gas producing wells Glenlee 11 and 13 are located inside the Mount Annan Botanic Gardens less than 100 metres from homes.\nThe tour visited Danielle Hodges, who spoke at a post-climate talks anti-fracking conference in Paris last December. Her house, part of a new development at Spring Farm, is located about 400 metres from 19 gas producing wells.\nDanielle, what health effects have you and your family suffered?\nMy family and I have suffered from horrific nose bleeds that can last up to 20 minutes, headaches that continue for months on end, nausea that continues for months on end and breathing issues with more serious asthma attacks. Everyone in the family has started to lose their hair \u2014 it comes out in chunks \u2014 and we've all had rashes.\nHow do you know this is connected to the CSG wells?\nWe never had these issues until we moved to Spring Farm. I have lived in the area my entire life. Until we moved here we lived five minutes up the road in Catherine Field and we never had any of those issues then. It's only since we've moved to this area, where we have a close proximity to the wells, that we've had these health issues. There are 19 wells in close proximity to my home, with the closest being about 400 metres away.\nYou have made complaints to AGL and various politicians. What has been their response?\nI've made complaints to AGL and politicians \u2014 local, federal, even Tony Abbott when he was in office \u2014 and I've always got the same generic response: go to our website, it's safe, we've done testing. They haven't actually done testing. So we just kind of get fobbed off.\nI want to see the wells in Campelltown closed down now, not in seven years' time. Seven years is too long. I want fracking and CSG mining and coalmining near people's homes to be stopped immediately.\nDanielle Hodges speaks out about the health effects of living a few hundred meters from coal seam gas wells in Spring Farm in Campbelltown in south-west Sydney."

About two and a half years ago, I went to France on a company sponsored trip.I was to work in the French head office of our company.Chores are shared, such as picking up kids from school, making dinner, etc. They both cared for eachother but he was in the army and was sent away. I welcome the idea of my wife have a second husband. We used to be very close but since high school we've drifted apart a little.We live together in a three bedroom home in Fresno, California.I've been in a polyandrous relationship for almost a year now. I've been with my legal 1st husband since I was 15 years old. We've had a very healthy relationship and I've never felt as though I was not receiving enough love or support... My husband and I met 7 yrs ago and have been together for almost 6 years now.I love him with all my heart and we have two beautiful children.\nMy brother is married to his wife for about three years now.\nI have always known that my boyfriend is bisexual, it was part of the reason I fell for him.\nAs a younger girl I always dreamed of falling madly in love with a good man, getting married, having children and all that good stuff. I'm married, happily, to L who is not a jealous type. Then the second husband would have rights to insurance, be able to be on a lease or deed, be able to be a beneficiary without going through additional paperwork, etc."

Why does being married matter when being a blogger?\nI can understand why being a married blogger might be hard for some. If your partner doesn't understand or want you to blog, it can be awkward. However I've never found it to be a problem!\nI started blogging almost a year ago now and can't say my marital status has made any difference to me!\nI suppose when you get invited to events and there isn't a plus one it could cause issues but I'm lucky enough for this to have never cause an issue!\nMy hubby is also a blogger, he started shortly after I did and we've both never looked back. I support his blog and the opportunities he gets and he supports my blog and mine. We've even been invited to the same events and PR days, so we've always had stuff to share. It's also awesome when we get items to review because we can get a second opinion too!\nOverall though, being married, engaged, in a relationship or single really shouldn't make a difference to your blogging. We blog because we love it and I know I'd do it even if I didn't have the support of my Husband, as harsh as it sounds!\nHas your marital/relationship status affected your blogging?\nI used to blog together with my husband, but have recently took it over as he found a rough time finding time to post. I think a supportive spouse is important and you have to communicate about when you want to share.\nI wouldn't say blogging has been effected, obviously the topics have as I'm a bride to be blogger so probably couldn't do that if I wasn't planning a wedding but overall no, my husband to be is supportive in anything I choose to do."

You can to use those 6 images of quotes as a desktop wallpapers.\nI never thought my marriage could be stronger, or I could be closer to Bill. We prayed on our own, but now we prayed together and you'll never know how much that means until you do it.\nI used to watch 'The Apprentice' all the time and I thought Bill was a fox. That was that, we didn't see each other for years, and then we saw each other and 45 minutes after the cameras stopped rolling, we were still talking.\nI would like to take the stigma away. 'Mastectomy' the word seemed so scary to me at first. After doing research and seeing the advancements, the surgery has come a long way from 20 years ago. The results can be incredible.\nI'm from Naples. I was born in a poor neighborhood and I always, in my heart, felt like it would be amazing to be able to adopt a child from Naples. I could give someone the opportunity I had. I would love to give back in that way and pay it forward.\nThere are thin girls with infertility issues, normal sized girls with infertility issues and overweight girls with infertility issues. Unless your doctor tells you your weight is affecting you in some way... once the doctor rules it out, that's really not it.\nTo me, natural, healthy looking skin is really beautiful. With a little concealer, eyeshadow, liner, gloss and bronzer, I love my lighter makeup look. I've saved so much money on facials!\nWe were married in Capri almost two years ago and we have made a pact with each other to visit the beautiful island and the church where we were married every year for the rest of our lives.\nWe're open people. I don't understand these Hollywood people who don't want to put their real life on TV, yet they want people to watch them and be fans with them.\nA lot of us think we're invincible... but we have to start putting ourselves on the to-do list.\nTo finally get that call from the doctor that you're pregnant and you're having a baby.... It was just another world.\nI thought I was dreaming. It was the most amazing moment of my entire life. Not only is Bill the love of my life, but he's also my best friend. I couldn't believe my dream guy was asking me to marry him!\nI love trainwrecks on live TV.\nMuch more quotes by Giuliana Rancic below the page.\nI wasn't prepared to get a mammogram until I was 40 years old, like I'd been told. I never in my wildest dreams expected anything to be wrong.\nIf you know me, you know that nothing embarrasses me. Anything could happen to me on live television, and I sincerely don't care.\nThere is a bigger plan for us. There is some reason we haven't had a kid. Our kid hasn't come yet for some reason. We really believe that.\nThrough my attempt to get pregnant through IVF, we sadly found out that I have early stages of breast cancer. It's been a shock.\nWe are really looking at all of our options. I mean, listen, whether it's IVF or whatever it is, we want to have a baby and we will have a baby.\nWe've gotten probably 40 women who have offered to be surrogates.\nWhen you do a reality show and host shows, it's hard to have secrets.\nFor me it was just more important to get the cancer out. With the double mastectomy I now have less than one per cent chance of getting it back, otherwise it was 20, 30 or 40 per cent chance and for me it wasn't worth it.\nI never thought I was pretty enough. I was kind of tall and lanky. I don't mind it now, but back in the day I hated it. I would tell myself that what I think is ugly at 17 is actually what's going to be pretty about me later."

This was a very united 220,000\u2026with huge power.\nThe allied army were all engaged in discussion, however while many elites were feeling unfair, with their position, they were only a generation of elites from the organizations, far from the position of universe level warriors! As for the 9th prince, with his mother\u2019s lineage and his own power, his position was much higher.\nIf it were outside and not the exam world.\nBu Luo Lin wouldn\u2019t even have any problem ordering the death of a universe level warrior! However this was the world within a world, Bu Luo Lin had to follow the given rules.\nWhen Bu Luo Lin entered the castle with his bodyguards, Luo Feng was already at the instruction of the castle\u2019s AI, entering into a cold ancient room within the castle.\nIn that ancient room, a dim light lit up the entire room, the scars and marks on the walls depicted the history of the castle, greenish black stone slabs on the wall, all with a lingering odor.\n\u201cWhat do you want to exchange for, punk.\u201d A serious voice resounded within the room.\nLuo Feng surveyed his surroundings, there wasn\u2019t anyone around.\n\u201cOf course exchange for treasures.\u201d Luo Feng said.\n\u201cDo you have thunder stones? These few days there\u2019ve been many who have come here on purpose but without any thunder stones to exchange.\u201d The serious voice continued.\nLuo Feng waved his hand and a pile of thunder stones the height of a person appeared.\n\u201cVery good.\u201d The voice said.\nFootsteps could be heard vaguely from the corridor outside, following which a fat, short and stout white bearded old man walked in, his body emanating light. Luo Feng could see from a glance that this old man was a living AI, similar to Babata on the Yun Mo ship from before, forming his own energy body.\n\u201cIt\u2019s rare for someone to exchange for something.\u201d The white bearded old man smiled as he looked at Luo Feng.\n\u201cHow are you old man, what should I address you as\u2026\u201d Luo Feng was very respectful.\nNo matter the case, the white bearded old man before him was a living AI, one that had followed sector lord Kabu and lived in solitude for over 10 million years. These sort of beings deserved respect! And according to Babata, having lived in solitude for ten million years, this old man must have been somewhat mentally perverted, he had better not get on his bad side.\n\u201cLittle punk, you can call me Lord Wu.\u201d The white bearded old man smiled, the light around him slightly swirling.\n\u201cLord Wu?\u201d Luo Feng was shocked.\n\u201cLord Wu, I want to exchange for treasures.\u201d Luo Feng said.\n\u201cWon\u2019t you keep me company and chat, what\u2019s the rush?\u201d The white bearded old man was disastisfied.\n\u201cHm?\u201d The white bearded old man seemed shocked.\nBabata had actually warned him much earlier before. In terms of surveillance, even though this white bearded old man\u2019s area was huge\u2026just like the earth\u2019s security defense system, which covered the entire solar system.\nHowever with such a huge area, the level of scanning was however much lower.\n\u201cLord Wu, do you have to ask something like that?\u201d Luo Feng was taken aback.\nLuo Feng felt incomparable anticipation within.\nThe 3 treasures were actually suggested by Babata. According to his plan\u2026the entire treasure list and prices were somewhat chaotic.\nFor example, the entire space technique crystal balls, those were priceless treasures! Price wise, it could be said to be 10,000 times or even 100,000 times the level 5 genetic energy weapon Fire Wheel\u2019s! However, the fire wheel only required 100,000 thunder stones while the crystal balls 3 codes only required 30 million thunder stones.\nIt was a total of 300 times only.\nFor example, the life fruit was 800,000 thunder stones, however it\u2019s true price outside was akin to a sector lord\u2019s life, more than even a hundred Fire wheels.\nThe prices weren\u2019t synced with the outside world prices. Buying itself required skill.\nThe level 5 genetic energy weapon Ice Soul Blade, in the outside world would be 5 to 6 times that of the Fire Wheel, the Pressure Void Cauldron was about ten times that of the Fire wheel! However in terms of exchanging\u2026the prices weren\u2019t too different.\nWithin the silent ancient room.\nThe white bearded old man covered entirely in light stood.\n\u201cThe total sum of the 3 treasures is 1.11 million Thunder Stones.\u201d The old man said.\n\u201cLord Wu, please keep it well.\u201d Luo Feng handed over a normal space ring, killing along the way had gotten Luo Feng many space rings.\n\u201cThis is the level 5 genetic energy weapon \u2018Ice Soul Blade.\u2019 The old man flipped his hand and immediately an entirely silver blue colored double tiered arc blade appeared, immediately, the entire room\u2019s temperature dropped and the entire space\u2019s humidity began to freeze, this peculiar blade\u2019s edge was incomparably sharp.\nLuo Feng felt like his soul was being sliced, extending his hand and keeping it in his space ring.\n\u201cThis is the level 5 spirit weapon \u2018Pressure Void Cauldron\u2019.\u201d The white bearded old man flipped his hand and a pure purple, like a copper cast little cauldron about 30cm tall floated before Luo feng, on it were large amounts of complex engravings, tens of millions of times more complex than the engravings on the soaring shuttle. It was similar to the golden engravings on the body of the golden horned beast.\nIt caused the surrounding space to feel like it was separated, even though it was only 30cm high, it made Luo Feng feel like it was incomparably huge, as though it was a mountain that couldn\u2019t be seen end to end, high than no mountain he\u2019d seen before, breathtaking.\n\u201cDon\u2019t look at it stupidly, a level 5 genetic energy weapon and a level 5 spirit weapon, they all have source engravings that are close to the universe\u2019s origin laws. Each have immense amount of power. However, only after becoming a sector lord, obtaining the universe source energy will one truly be able to use them.\u201d Babata\u2019s voice resounded in Luo Feng\u2019s mind.\nLuo Feng awoke from the trance, extending his hand to keep the Pressure Void Cauldron in his space ring.\nJust 2 level 5 weapons made him totally unable to resist. It was said that when sector lords battled, they would changed the land and skies, one move could destroy all life on an entire planet. It was indeed true!\n\u201cLittle punk.

Just this one fruit, sector lords would use an entire galaxy to exchange for, with countless Sector Lords willing to exchange!\n\u201cSniff!\u201d Luo Feng took a deep breath and that aroma filled his body, his every cell excitedly jumped up, as though they were eating a heavenly dish, changes began to naturally happen within his inherited genes, his entire bone structure letting out snaps, even his muscles began to change.\n\u201cIdiot, quickly close it. The moment you open it, the life fruit\u2019s life energy will constantly dissipate!\u201d Babata raged.\nLuo Feng quivered before awaking from the trance.\nHe closed to stone box.\n\u201cIdiot, your 2 breaths, you lose about a hundred breaths from that.\u201d Babata raged.\nLuo Feng excitedly closed the stone box.\nI didnt understand what Babata meant by that last line.\nI think he just meant that by opening the box he lost 100 breaths of the stuff cus it dissipated. Whereas he only breathed in twice."

I\u2019ve cautioned several times that reading too much into this number is a bad idea. Partly it\u2019s because the first estimate is liable to change\u2014a lot. But there\u2019s another really important reason: labor force participation\u2014who\u2019s actually actively working or trying to work\u2014is another crucial indicator of how we\u2019re doing. If the unemployment rate is only falling because discouraged job seekers are giving up, then we haven\u2019t solved any problems.\nIn fact, new research by my colleagues Austin Nichols and Stephan Lindner shows that while the labor force participation rate indeed fell, the story is not about discouraged workers giving up. Instead, fewer workers than before are entering the job market, and much of that decline is among young women.\nOn the face of it, this may not be a bad thing: perhaps young women are simply seeking out more education and better skills that will make them more employable later. It\u2019s also possible, though, that millennial women simply feel discouraged about the job market and aren\u2019t job searching right now. The upshot: many things influence the job market, and we really don\u2019t know enough to say for sure if things are looking up or down.\nPhoto from shutterstock.

Before coming to US, I have heard that economics phd is one of the hardest program to apply and to learn. Even worse, the job market for economic phd is also one of the worst among all the programs. If so, in the standing of the economic perspective, why do all your guys still choose economics phd to pursue? for the personal interest or the bad job market is just a rumor? Thanks!\nHey Jack. The job market for PhDs in economics is not bad at all, considering the employment rate of the degree is in the ninety(ith) percentile. The issues are in academic placement, where there is definitely a higher supply of fresh top-notch PhDs than the ideal slots that we all want.\nAnd a metric ton of economists have started to retire, the boomers. The market for academics is looking great.\nSame here, it is a no brainer. If I were looking for money I'd be posting on the MBA forum.\nPrivate sector is fine by me. Right now I'm excited to see the outcome of the Microsoft/Yahoo/Google royal rumble. I have a lot of potential research ideas locked up in those companies.\nI never really thought about the boomers retiring. Good point.\nI just love economics. Besides, there are many good jobs available (both in and out of academia). I'm not sure what I want to do specifically, I just know I want to spend the rest of my life studying the discipline in one way or another. Likely I'll either become a professor or an economic consultant.\nThere is a shortage of skilled economists in Trinidad if anyone is interested.\nLiving in the Carribbean doesn't sound so bad. Years ago I actually considered being a divemaster for a career."

Those early findings from Michigan State University\u2019s annual survey of employers are in accord with other statistics showing that the job market has gotten stronger since the recession.\nHowever, economists say the good news doesn\u2019t trickle backwards to people who graduated during the down years. For instance, the Michigan State numbers show salaries for new engineers will be about $6,000 higher than they were for 2009 graduates.\n\"There is no way that those people who came in at 2009 are going to be at that salary,\" says Michigan State\u2019s Philip Gardner, who conducted the survey. \"It would take some pretty nice wage increases.\"\nThe Michigan State findings echo other recent data, says Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless. So does the bad news for earlier graduates.\n\"There\u2019s no doubt that entering the job market\u2014either as a new college graduate or a new high-school graduate\u2014at a time of high unemployment is not the best career move,\" says Burtless.\nThose workers can see their wages stay relatively low for 10 years or more.\nShu Lin Wee, an economist at Carnegie Mellon University, has studied the process by which recession-era grads lose out, in a paper titled \"Born Under a Bad Sign: The Cost of Entering the Job Market During a Recession.\"\nHer numbers show that when jobs are scarce, young people don\u2019t get to hop around from career to career as much. Finding the first job is enough challenge.\n\"Even if you manage to find a job,\" she says, \"and you realize that you\u2019re not very good at that particular career, now you have problems switching jobs.\nSo you develop fewer skills and don\u2019t get experience with other fields that might be a better fit."

                            "text": "Magic On \"The Forest Path\"\nA boy walked through the forest. He was only 17 years old, the youngest Eeshkadu ever to become a sentinel. It was a great honor and a heavy burden. If he failed in his duties, it would prevent anyone like him from ever becoming a sentinel. \u2014 How can I fail, \u2014 thought the boy proudly. \u2014 The chances of my finding anything on my patrol are small, and I walk with Kad\u00fcve\u2019s blessing. \u2014 The boy continued, casually avoiding fallen twigs and leaves. The boy passed through the forest just as he was trained; he made no noise or trail by which he could be followed or detected.\nThe boy continued through the forest until he reached a clearing where a family of deer, including one rather large buck, grazed on the thick vegetation of the forest floor. On the far side of the clearing, he noticed a young woman dart behind a tree. \u2014 Well, well, a hunter. \u2014 The boy crouched down, as he continued to watch the woman slowly creep around the tree, preparing to draw her bow. \u2014 You\u2019re a peculiar one. . . hunting so close to the city, \u2014 the boy thought to himself. He considered stopping the hunter and saving the deer, but something prompted him to watch instead. So he sat and focused on the hunter. Her black hair contrasted starkly with her unusually white skin. Her technique with a bow was not perfect, but neither was it bad. The woman released her arrow, striking a doe as it moved into her view. The deer scattered; the large buck running into the forest just a few feet from the boy.\nThe boy pressed his palm to the ground beneath him before whispering, \u201cm\u00e4tawna de Kad\u2019ro\u00eb.\u201d The skin on the boy\u2019s hand began to turn a dark brown as he held his eyes closed. He saw the world around him in black and white, every sound illuminated a new object. He saw the doe running away from the clearing, her heartbeat skipping and struggling to pump blood through her wounded body. The boy could sense the arrow as it scraped against the doe's heart. The doe slowed to a strained walk as her heart began to fade. Then she stopped altogether, illuminating the forest floor for a brief moment as she fell.\nThe boy opened his eyes and lifted his darkened hand from the ground, as he did its color slowly returned to normal. He felt the fatigue from the magic he had used begin to set in. It was a simple spell so the drain would be minimal.\nDisappointment swept across the boy\u2019s face as the hunter celebrated her kill while she tracked it through the forest. \u2014 The death of an animal is nothing to celebrate, \u2014 he thought. Then he began to hear what she was saying to herself.\n\u201cNo potatoes and bread for dinner tonight! We\u2019re having a real meal.\u201d The girl\u2019s voice was indeed in the mood of a celebration, but not over the kill. It was a celebration over the meal it would provide.\n\u201cPerhaps the village elders would be lenient with this one. Her intentions seemed noble enough.\u201d The boy\u2019s voice was a whisper, barely audible over the hunter\u2019s footsteps. Although he could not have said what it was, the boy could sense there was something special about this hunter.\nAs the girl left the clearing, the boy followed. \u2014 It is a shame that deer will go to waste, \u2014 the boy thought, knowing it was his duty to arrest her and bring her before the elders for trial.\nThe hunter\u2019s demeanor changed when she reached the deer. She was no longer celebrating; she was calm and reverent. She carefully knelt by the deer and began to pray. The boy was shocked; he could not hear what the hunter was saying, yet he knew to whom she prayed. The boy could feel the presence of the god of earth, assuring him that the deer had been his gift to her.\nThe boy ducked behind a tree, bewildered. He had never heard of a city dweller receiving Kad\u00fcve\u2019s blessing.\nShe was finished praying now. The boy knew he should not address her, but his curiosity was overwhelming. \u201cIt is good that you honor Kad\u00fcve in your kill. I would have been obligated to arrest you for poaching otherwise.\u201d He would have tried to stop himself, but the words had escaped his mouth before he could register what he was saying.\n\u201cWho are you? Show yourself.\u201d The hunter\u2019s voice was shaky. He had startled her.\n\u2014 Now I have to introduce myself, \u2014 the boy thought, ashamed yet excited that he would meet the hunter.\n\u2014 Pretty young girls? \u2014 Bahn thought. He hadn't meant to sound condescending. This girl was no older than he was, and it wasn't like non-pretty girls were any safer. However, she held a nice figure. Her face was smooth and confident; her eyes were brown like most city dwellers, but something about them felt different. The hunter was studying him, deciding if she should relax in Ban\u2019s presence.\n\"Do you mind if I take from that doe what you cannot carry?\u201d The girl\u2019s posture seemed to relax slightly, and the look of anxiety cleared from her face. She felt the pouches of meat by her sides before replying.\n\u201cTake what you want; I have what I need. I know the way back to the city; the journey is easy enough.\u201d The hunter was nervous, stumbling over her words as she talked.\n\u2014 Am I really that intimidating? \u2014 Bahn honestly did not know the answer. This girl was impossible to read; the way she acted was utterly foreign to him. He continued to study her as he walked toward the deer.\n\u201cWon\u2019t you at least tell me your name?\u201d called Bahn as the hunter began to walk away from him. Bahn lifted his head towards the girl, and for a moment their eyes met.\nThe hunter\u2019s cheeks turned red as she looked away. \u201cMy name is Ayela.\u201d Her voice now was different than before. It was quiet, almost shy.\n\u201cA pleasure to meet you, Ayela. I do hope we meet again.\u201d Bahn stood, holding his fist over his chest before nodding his head at Ayela. \u201cMay the forest protect you on your journey.\u201d It was a standard parting gesture among the Shaforesi, but Bahn wondered if Ayela would take it as something more.\nAyela blushed again and quickly turned away before she walked into the forest, back toward the city.\nOnce she was gone, Bahn rose to his feet; he had never intended to take any of the doe, he merely wanted the hunter to relax. The rest of the day passed without event as Bahn continued through the forest, his mind continually returning to Ayela. He wondered how often she had been to the mountain forest without getting caught, then marveled at her seeming ability to avoid the other sentinels. Bahn still could not shake the feeling that there was something special about Ayela, that he was somehow meant to find her amidst the sea of trees. It was nearing sunset, and Bahn had begun to travel back to the village. His first shift was over, and he had not failed his duties.\nThe village was calm and quiet, just as it always was. The straw and wooden buildings blended into the wall of trees behind them. Bahn could see several other sentinels returning from their patrols, all of them tired from a day of walking through the forest. Bahn walked between the village buildings, in an attempt not to be noticed by the other sentinels. He wished to avoid their weary eyes. He was the youngest sentinel; he also carried a higher capacity for magic than most sentinels in the village. However, unlike any sentinel before him, Bahn also shared a small connection to dark magic. This fact made the older sentinels and seekers nervous. They feared that Ban\u2019s strength would overtake him and that he would become a servant of darkness.\nBan eventually reached his home, a small hut at the northern edge of the village. He could smell the sweet aroma of a fresh meal emanating from the house.\n\u201cWelcome home, Ban.\u201d The smooth voice of his mother was a gift to Ban\u2019s tired ears. He smiled and sat down at the dinner table. Bahn closed his eyes and took in the smell of the soup still simmering in the large iron pot in the center of the table. \u201cHow was your first day as a Sentinel?\u201d Ban\u2019s mother stood next to him. Her long light brown hair draped in a braid over her left shoulder. Bahn recalled how, in his childhood, he would stare into his mother\u2019s deep blue eyes, getting lost in the sea of emotions that flowed behind them.\n\u201cIt went well.\u201d Bahn could barely hear his own thoughts over the rumbling of his stomach. He opened his eyes and noticed his father across from him. His father was looking over a scroll laid out on the table. Bahn was almost identical to his father in appearance. They shared the same bright green eyes, black hair, and dark skin. This was natural, as both of them were Eeshkadu, earth elementals, whereas Ban\u2019s mother was an Eeshma, a water elemental.\nBan\u2019s father lifted his head toward Ban. \u201cDid anything happen on your patrol today?\u201d His father was distracted; it was unclear whether or not he was even listening for the answer.\n\u201cIt was uneventful.\u201d Bahn decided not to tell his parents about the girl in the forest; they would question him as to why he did not arrest her. Bahn felt he might not be capable of explaining his reasoning, as he could barely understood it.\n\u201cThat\u2019s good news, I suppose. However, it means you will not be as prepared for tomorrow\u2019s patrol.\u201d His father\u2019s voice was that of concern. This frightened Ban, as he had never before seen his father visibly worried about anything.\n\u201cWhy? Where are they sending me?\u201d Bahn was afraid of the answer, but he was also anxious for the chance to prove his strength and self-control to the elders.\nBan\u2019s mother filled a bowl of soup for each of them and sat at the table. The three of them joined hands and bowed their heads. \u201cOh, great Kad\u00fcve. We thank Thee. By your grace, the earth brought forth its fruit. By your grace, the stag gave its life for us, for this meal. With your blessing, we partake of thy gifts. That they may strengthen us and fill us with courage for our trials to come.\u201c There was a long pause after Ban\u2019s mother finished the prayer, only to be broken moments later by her voice. \u201cBan. We have trained you your whole life to resist the darkness. However, you have never been in a situation to test your resilience before now.\u201d Ban\u2019s mother grabbed hold of his hand and squeezed. \u201cWe are understandably nervous Ban. If you give into the power. . .\u201d His mother stopped, unable to finish her sentence.\n\u201cI will father, just as you have told me many times before.\u201d It was a sentiment Bahn had heard countless times from his father. Yet no matter how many times he heard it, the concept of not fearing the darkness was far easier said than done.\nThe next few minutes went by in silence as they finished their meals. Each of them felt the tension and anxiety that would make sleep impossible.\nBan woke to the bright rays of sunrise flooding his room. He was disappointed; he felt as though he had only just fallen asleep. \u2014 I have to prove myself without sleep? \u2014 Ban was possibly more nervous now than when he had gone to sleep.\nBan grudgingly clothed himself in his traveling clothes. He took extra care not to forget his thick leather armor for this patrol; the northern forest was densely populated by beasts of prey, and he needed the additional protection.\nBan walked out of his room into the living area. His usual breakfast of warm bread and honey sat on the table. He ate quickly, then headed outside. His mother and father would be in the garden, and he wanted to say farewell before heading to the elders for the usual parting ceremony. Bahn was surprised when he opened the door to find his mother and father on the other side.\n\u201cWe were just coming in to wake you.\u201d His mother\u2019s voice was calm and even and seemed to pacify the storm of dread, worry, and anxiety that swam through Ban\u2019s mind. \u201cWe are coming to the parting ceremony with you. Your father and I want to see you off.\u201d He was glad that his parents would accompany him. Bahn would be gone for an entire week. This patrol would be the longest time he had ever spent away from home.\nThe three of them walked in silence to the north side of the village, where three of the four village elders and a woman Bahn did not recognize stood waiting.Judging by her armor, the woman was a seeker, an elite of the Shaforesi Guard. The elders were in their usual ceremonial robes of bright green and blue; their faces were covered by their hoods, leaving only their eyes exposed.\nThe elder in the center nodded his head toward Ban. \u201cElder Koma refused to attend this ceremony. He believes it blasphemy to allow one with a connection to the darkness into the ranks of the sentinels.\u201d His voice was deep and rough; it carried a tone of irritation that Bahn assumed was directed at the absent elder.\nThe elder on the right stepped toward Bahn \u201cIt is our duty to send you into the northern forest on your next patrol. However, you must know that this is also a test of your strength and will. Toraw is a seeker of the fourth rank.\u201d The elder motioned to the woman whose eyes fell judgingly on Ban. \u201cShe is assigned with observing your patrol. Should you fail and give into the darkness, she will arrest you and return you here for trial. Toraw was chosen because even if you gave yourself fully to the darkness, you would pose no threat to her.\u201d Bahn shifted nervously as he eyed the woman, her expression unsettled him. For a moment Bahn began to question his own strength, but the thought was interrupted by the third elder's voice.\n\u201cWe do not expect you to succeed in resisting the darkness, but should you return victorious we will raise you to Sentinel of the Second Rank.\u201d The third elder\u2019s voice was high and rough. The first time Bahn had heard it, had had nearly burst into laughter. \u201cDo you accept the patrol, or will you give up on this foolish notion of joining the guard.\u201d The second elder leaned toward the one standing in the center. He whispered something that caused the center elder to grunt in brief laughter.\nThe small promotion was meaningless to Bahn as he did not care about rank. However, the mockery by the elders brought fire to his eyes. He had known they did not believe in him, but hearing it just made him angry. Bahn made up his mind; he would prove to these fossils that he was stronger than they thought; he would pass their test without breaking a sweat.\n\u201cI do.\u201d Ban\u2019s voice was that of confidence, inspired by anger and the desire to prove the elders wrong. \u201cI will return in one week with an even stronger resolve against the darkness than I already possess.\u201d Bahn fell to one knee and awaited the blessing of the elders.\nFor a long moment, nothing happened. . . \u2014 Well? \u2014 thought Ban. Then the elder in the center placed his hand on Ban\u2019s shoulder.\nDo you have a question or theory about this story that you would like to share?

                            "text": "The Amber God, some called him.\nIt was rumored that this god sometimes walked among the villagers. Whenever someone wore amber perfume or burned amber incense, their friends and neighbors would tease and ask, \u201cAre you the Amber God?\u201d The villagers fancied he was their guardian.\nOne day a stranger came to the village. His clothing was strange and it gleamed like black water. His face was strange, for it was milky pale but painted with black tattoos along his cheeks and forehead. He had a strange ring on his finger, made not of metal, but of wood\u2013sandalwood some said who had seen it. He settled in the village\u2019s only inn and no one could suss out what his business was.\nHe arrived with the new moon and though it waxed and waned and he did nothing further to disrupt life in the village, the villagers remained curious and wary. They watched and they wondered. Soon the rumor spread that the stranger had developed a rivalry with one of the villagers, a man who lived near the border between the village and the forest. This man was neither loved nor hated nor was he special in any way. He was known mostly for the old-fashioned cloak of coarse wool that he wore and the long bushy beard that he kept.\nWhen the stranger and this villager passed in the street, they would each stiffen and ignore the other. When the two came into the pub, they would glare at each other. The stranger would sit on a barstool by himself. The villager would take a table in the corner. How it started and what the feud was about, no one knew. But after a while and for no apparent reason, the villagers began to take sides. The stranger soon had a group of men and women who regularly join him at the bar. The villager had his own group of supporters at his corner table.\nSoon, some villagers began to mark their faces with black ink and fire soot to copy the stranger\u2019s tattoos. Others began wearing wool cloaks and growing beards, like the villager. Soon, it seemed that everyone was either favoring the stranger or favoring the villager. Those who wished not to be involved were coerced by friends or family to choose. The two rivals did nothing to stop such behavior. Even most of the village elders had chosen sides. The few elders who had not chosen sides worried that the village would fall to riot and ruin if the feud did not end. And so, the three elders who remained yet untouched by the feud met in secret to discuss what should be done. The three elders had noticed another change that disturbed them. The villager and his followers had begun to smell of amber. The stranger and his followers had begun to smell of sandalwood. The three elders feared that their village was in the grip of a struggle that was beyond their earthly power to control. And yet, they were the elders and they loved their village and their people. They resolved to act, to bring the stranger and the villager to their council and ask both men to leave the village. They feared the village might fail anyway, becoming abandoned as the people left to follow the man to which they were loyal. But they hoped that the spell of the feud would be broken once the two rivals left, and that the villagers would regain their reason and be unified once more.\nBut the morning after this secret meeting, the three elders found their fellow villagers in the streets. The villagers were armed with butcher knives, mops, wooden beams, and the like, and were arguing as one. In the center stood the two rivals, the stranger and the villager. The elders could see there were no children in the crowd, but before they could give thanks for that and before they could utter any pleas for reason and peace, someone was struck, someone yelled out, and the villagers surged toward each other.\nThe riot lasted till nightfall.\nBy some miracle, no one was killed. But there were broken arms and legs, and blood everywhere from stabs and cuts and bruises, and one woman could not move her limbs, and one man had lost an eye. A few buildings burned. And the three elders were thankful it had not been worse, for they had feared that by nightfall, there would be no one left in the village who was not a corpse.\nThe three elders found the stranger and the villager, and restraining their great anger and their great fear, they asked the men to leave.\nThe stranger and the villager declared that their feud was not yet over, but agreed that they would settle their differences without involving the villagers. They gave no apology and no reparation.\nAnd the villagers, their might spent and their senses stunned, went home to heal themselves.\nThat same night a storm broke out of a clear sky. A sudden gust unfurled a blanket of dark clouds that poured water and ice onto the village. The elders watched from the inn where many of the villagers had gathered to have their wounds tended. Lightning crashed around the village. Thunder boomed. The pelting of ice and the drumming of rain became the music of their days and nights. The villagers were hardy and their stores of food and fuel were vast. They took care of each other and rarely ventured out.\nSome claimed they could see figures in the clouds, and arms hurling lighting or giant fistfuls of hail. But most were tired of such stories and wanted only to see the blue sky and the yellow sun. The villagers had grown weary of the commotion and of their own feud. They longed for respite. And one morning, their longing was finally fulfilled. As suddenly as it had come, the storm vanished. A gentle sun rose and melted and dried and warmed the village.\nThe villagers rebuilt their village and went about their lives. To the approval of the three elders who had refused to take sides, the villagers had learned to be kinder to each other, gentler with each other, and slower to anger. Sometime later the villagers ventured back into the forest. And in the middle of the forest, they found the stone hut. Untouched by the storm.\nAnd from that stone hut came the scent of sandalwood.\nCopyright \u00a9 2013, by Nila L. Patel. All rights reserved."

                            "text": "The flames licked around the limbs of the dead, a young man named Siaki. He deserved to be chosen. He had proven himself and brought much honor to his family as he perfected his skills and mastered his use of tools and weapons alike. In many ways, he reminded the Shaman of his own son.\nThe smell of charred flesh stuck to the Shaman\u2019s hair and clothes and crept down his throat. In the bitterness of the morning, he questioned his loyalty to the village and to the gods. What would happen if they learned that Siaki never reached his promised paradise?\nThe fire died down, leaving greasy blackened bones and gristle on the ashes. One armful at a time, he took the bones to a hidden area of the palm forest where the ants hunted. They could be trusted with cleaning the bones before they could be ground to powder and mixed into the sand of the beach.\nHe placed the last bone, Siaki\u2019s skull, at the base of the tallest palm and cradled it into a depression in the sand. There, he knelt and offered one last prayer for the safe passage of Siaki\u2019s soul to the afterlife.\nThe stink of death clung to the Shaman\u2019s skin, forcing him to wash himself before taking up the totems and ceremonial dress once more. He lifted the beaded and feathered chestpiece and set it on his shoulders, feeling the weight settle against his bare skin, a weight meant to represent the solemnity of his office. The feathered headdress pinched at his temples, a constant reminder of his duty to be an example of humility and devotion. He hated the last piece the most. The staff of crooked driftwood bore rows upon rows of elaborate weavings and beadwork. Each duty he fulfilled, each birth, each successful harvest, and each winter ritual added another narrow band of color.\nHe lifted the staff to his shoulder. The walk back to the village from the secluded beach pressed harder against his heart with each passing year.\nSiaki\u2019s family would be waiting for him. He would reassure them that their beloved child had indeed reached the golden shore. The lie became harder with each year.\nOnly one person took the sting of his duty away, at least for a time. Makana with the silken shoulders, his wife, waited under the lip of the rise, as she had each year since the day they had been joined.\nLying to her hurt most of all. To speak the truth would rob the sparkle from her eyes. How could she love one who allowed such a horror to continue?\n\u201cHe is in his new home now. May his soul find happiness there.\u201d The lie brought with it a taste of ash and bile in his throat.\nLiko held a collection of two-pronged spears and stood on the edge of a rock as he studied the water. With one smooth motion, he flung the spear and pulled out a brilliant silver wriggling fish.\nThe Shaman rubbed at the tense spot between his eyes. For the last several years, Liko had been asking to come along with him and learn how to give the ceremonial offerings on behalf of the one traveling to the island.\n\u201cHow long did he stay awake waiting for me?\u201d he asked.\nMaintaining a serene face, despite the raging storm of emotion that threatened to overwhelm him, took energy that the Shaman did not have. Facing the family of a boy that he knew was dead would test him once more. He could not let them lose the hope that their son lived on in paradise. Having a child chosen among all the youth brought the family great honor.\nThe sight of the family, so content, so at peace, made the Shaman wish the gods would allow at least one of these youth to reach the golden shore instead of claiming them all. It was by the grace of the gods that they knew of the Golden Island. It was by their hands that the sun shone through the narrow pass between the twin sleeping volcanos and made the promised island appear and shine like fire.\n\u201cWe shall see. No one knows what the future holds.\u201d The Shaman gave a short bow and turned before Siaki\u2019s father could continue talking of the future.\nWhen the Shaman returned to his hut he found Liko pacing back and forth deep in thought. He cleared his throat, making the boy jump.\nThe Shaman selected one of the leaf wrapped morsels from the basket in the center of the small space. \u201cI am sure you have eaten.\u201d He opened the leaf to find a piece of beautifully cooked fish.\nThe Shaman arched an eyebrow. Ever since he had earned his first feathers, the boy had tested his limits. At least he never tried to fight. Showing disrespect would lower his standing in the tribe\u2019s eyes.\n\u201cSince when do you get to decide when to learn parts of your trade?\u201d He proceeded carefully, each word measured and delivered with quiet precision.\nThe ache to tell his son the truth squeezed at the Shaman\u2019s heart. If the boy knew, all his uncertainty would disappear. He would stop this crazy quest to be the best and learn to enjoy life one day at a time.\nThe son gave another bow, so formal, too formal. The Shaman wished he could hold Liko in his arms like he used to when the boy was small. There would be so few chances left to spend time with him. The next winter equinox would come far too fast and with it, the return of the island.\nThe Shaman recovered Siaki\u2019s skull, now grey and picked clean and could not help but think that the next skull would be that of his own son. He pushed the thought from his mind. Grieving something that was not certain would only poison the remaining months before the contest. With a sharp stylus, he inscribed the bone with Siaki\u2019s life, his name, his deeds.\nWhen the tide dropped low, he walked out into the water and ducked under the waves to the hidden entrance of the cave. He pushed through the darkness, feeling the familiar pain of air burning in his lungs. Inside the cave, a dim light filtered down from a small opening high above. Dozens of skulls lined the walls, too many. The Shaman could not bring himself to count them, as if knowing the exact number would make him personally accountable for each death.\nKnowing that his father before him had done the same grim task alone for so many years before he had come of age to help, eased the burden.\nWith a sigh, he set Siaki\u2019s skull high on a ledge where the light would touch it from time to time. He allowed himself to imagine the future when Liko would be entrusted with the same secret about the contest and would learn how to prepare the dead as a sacrifice to the gods. He would no longer have to bear the terrible burden alone.\nDays and weeks passed, fast and steady like the tide. For the children reaching their 17th cycle, this was the last chance to prove themselves worthy of taking part of the yearly contest. Liko stood tall, a rare pearl among the oysters, his great shoulders a testament to the many hours spent swimming across the bay and diving deep for abalone.\nThe nights grew cooler and the sun\u2019s rays at sunset crept closer and closer toward the notch between the two mountains. Each evening when the sun dipped low to the horizon, the Shaman measured the path of light and shadow. As much as he wished it, he could not stop the sun from moving, just as he could not stop the wind or waves.\nThe announcement brought a chorus of cheers from the assembled families. Runners leapt up from around the fire, like flying embers, to notify those living on other parts of the isle. Makana and Liko cheered along with the rest while the Shaman held his silence. At times like these the Shaman was grateful for the solemn nature of his position. Nothing could have felt more wrong than cheering for the death of yet another child.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, giving her hand one last squeeze. She did not know that as Liko\u2019s father he was not allowed to speak on his son\u2019s behalf, a fact he was very grateful for. Not being forced to choose and debate over his son\u2019s life relieved a small portion of the anguish that had already wormed its way deep within.\nThe council debated long into the night, as they had done each year. Only the best of the youth could be chosen. Allowing those who had not shown enough devotion offended the gods. Those early hours weighed heavy on the Shaman. Liko numbered among those chosen, as he had known he would. The boy had earned it. It was his right and privilege to honor the family.\nWhen the council adjourned, the Shaman could not rest. He wandered the island until he found himself on the sacred ground of the isolated beach. There, he fell to his knees and offered his strongest prayers to the gods that his son not be taken from him. Not yet. There was still honor in being chosen and not winning the right to swim to the Golden Island.\nWhen the morning came, the Shaman returned home. He could not bear to watch while Makana readied Liko. She rubbed his skin with fragrant oils and braided his hair into neat rows adorned with beads and feathers. He excused himself from their hut, pleading that he needed to offer another prayer for Liko\u2019s sake.\nMorning progressed and more and more people gathered on the beach. Small knots formed around the youth in their elaborate costumes. A cluster of children stood in awe around Liko along with a sizable group of girls who had already passed their seventeenth year.\nAnother conch sounded and the twenty-seven youth stepped forward and stood in a line waiting for the elders to make their choice. Their skin shone, brilliant in the morning sun, and the beads in their hair rustled in the ocean breeze.\nOne by one the elders walked the line, pulling those chosen forward. As they approached Liko, the boy\u2019s eyes met those of the Shaman. He had expected to see fear there, as he had seen in so many of the other boys and girls. Instead, Liko\u2019s gaze was firm and steady. His face remained calm as the elders pulled him forward, showing nothing of what he must be feeling inside.\nIn the crowd, tears of pride ran down Makana\u2019s face. If the Shaman did not give some sign of his approval, she would never forgive him. He met Liko\u2019s gaze once more and gave him a nod. Thoughts of having to burn his son\u2019s body made it hard to do anything more. Still, when Liko saw it, he smiled wide enough to show all of his gleaming white teeth.\nWith the selection finished the council wasted no time organizing the first event, a race around the perimeter of the island. The twelve selected youth toed the line drawn in the sand. All eyes locked on the elder who stood out front, a stout walking stick stretched high before him. The crowd went silent, waiting for his signal.\nThe stick fell. When it touched the sand, the twelve ran, churning up clouds with their bare feet. Younger brothers and sisters ran to the steep sides of the closer sister volcano to watch as their siblings made the circuit, calling out who was in the lead to those waiting below.\nThe Shaman did not strain his ears like the others to hear, like his wife did, but he could tell from the happy glances, from the encouraging shouts that Liko was in the lead.\nMakana glared at him when she noticed. \u201cWhy can you not be happy that he is doing well?\u201d she said between her teeth so those standing near could not hear.\nHer revelation yanked an involuntary gasp from his lips. All these years he had withheld his approval in hopes that Liko would rebel and spend his energy in anger instead of excelling at whatever task he was given. Learning that it had the opposite effect, that it was what pushed him harder and longer than the other children, made the Shaman\u2019s hands shake.\nA shout arose from the far edge of the beach as competitors rounded the final corner. Liko led the pack with another boy following close on his heels. The last stretch returned the runners to the soft sands of the beach. The Shaman silently willed Liko to trip, so that anyone other than him would win.\nFate has a funny way of working against one\u2019s desires. The stronger the Shaman pleaded for his son to fall, the faster his son moved until he seemed to soar like a long-winged albatross. The other boy had no chance against Liko\u2019s swift strides.\nOther events such as swimming, fishing, and wrestling came and went filling that day and most of the next. The Shaman struggled to bring himself to watch, knowing that each victory brought the boy that much closer to his death.\nAt the end of the afternoon, Liko stood with his head held high. He had won.\nPeople, hundreds of them, swept around Liko, eager to congratulate him on a job well done. They pushed past the Shaman who could not bring himself to move. It was no surprise Liko won. However, he had prayed so many times for it not to happen that he could not help but feel betrayed.\nA frail hand tugged on his elbow. Elder Iana, the eldest of the council, was so old and bent that his white tufted head only reached the Shaman\u2019s shoulder. He beckoned him to come away from the crowd.\nA shout came from further up the beach. The Shaman did not need to look to know that the Golden Island had appeared in the distance. The tribe would be waiting for him to perform the farewell ceremony.\nThe Shaman wrapped his hand around his staff, feeling each of the bands under his palm, each death, each birth, each sickness. How could he be a spiritual leader if he did not believe?\nThe crowd parted to either side, letting him pass through to the clearing where Liko and Makana stood.\nThe Shaman held his arms out wide and the noise of the crowd quieted. The ceremonial words came unbidden to his tongue and flowed from his lips. So many years he had stood in the same place, saying the same words, all the while knowing it would be the last time he would see that year\u2019s champion alive.\nHow dare his tongue make saying those same words to his son effortless!\nWhen they released each other the crowd surged again, forcing them apart and urging Liko into the waves. After one last goodbye wave he dove into the water and was gone.\nThat night it was not his place to break her heart. He slipped away and over the ridge where the village believed he did everything in his power to protect and guide the victor in his journey. He could hold on to his secret as long as he needed to, there was far more happiness in thinking that their son had left to a better place.\nBack on the isolated beach, accompanied by the whispers of the sea, the Shaman constructed the funeral pyre one heavy log at a time. The last thing he could offer his son was a steady strong fire to consume his body and send his soul rising and spiraling up into the heavens.\nWhen the pyre was finished, he wiped the fibers of the coconut husk kindling from his hands and knelt in the sand of the beach. Even with his faith broken, he would continue to pray on behalf of his son as he waited and watched for the boy\u2019s body to return. It would be hours yet. The night darkened and the stars made their slow march overhead. Each year for the past thirty years the body had always returned in the hour before the rising of the sun.\nHowever, when the morning light spilled over the edge of the sea there was still no sign of Liko. The thought of the gods accepting his son when they had rejected so many should have brought him happiness. Instead, it filled him with horror. The boy should have died and his body returned safely to shore. The Shaman\u2019s prayers had gone unanswered for so long that he was convinced the gods had stopped listening ages ago. He continued to try. The people needed his devotion to fortify their own.\nThe Shaman walked the length of the beach, searching the rocks and around the base of the cliffs for any sign of his son. He would never forgive himself if Liko\u2019s body was out there and he overlooked it.\nHe paced the length of the beach once more allowing another, and another, hour to pass. The village expected to see the smoke from his fire to signal that all was well, but with no body to burn, the Shaman questioned whether he should wait longer or go ahead and light the blaze.\nHis thoughts drifted to Makana waiting for the sign, waiting for him, on the other side of the ridge. Whatever fears haunted him, he knew hers would be worse. Every moment he delayed caused her greater pain. She needed to believe all was well, that Liko had reached a better place. Perhaps he had.\nThe Shaman set his flint to the base of the pyre, setting the logs ablaze. Soon, thick smoke rose into the sky. Only then did the Shaman allow himself to mourn the loss of his son. With all of the other children he knew the certainty of their fate. He took great care that their bodies received the respect they deserved. Not being able to do the same for his son left him hollow inside.\nThe heat from the fire dried the tears that would not stop flowing. For so long, he had prepared his heart for the day where he would be the one to burn his son\u2019s body and commit his bones to the sand of the beach. He could never have prepared himself for this.\nThe fire burned to ash. The emptiness remained. He wanted to curse the gods for burdening him with these new doubts. Had they been waiting all this time for the proper sacrifice? Why his child? Why not any of the others?\nElder Iana and his own father had always taught that this life was a test. Had the gods been testing him all this time? If it had been a test, what was he supposed to learn? His son was gone and he was not sure where.\nThe totems of the Shaman\u2019s office rested in the sand at the base of the ridge that separated him from the village. He took up the heavy chestpiece, the headdress that pinched, and finally the staff. Another band of color would be added to join the dozens of others: Liko\u2019s band.\nJodi L.

                            "text": "Do you ever look back? Back at all the twists and turns of this road we call life? God has shown me this past year, how important it is to look back occasionally. Not with a longing for what\u2019s been left behind (like Lot\u2019s wife), but rather for a reminder of our personal story of redemption.\nBy looking back, we not only find ourselves in awe of a God who loves us so\u2026 so passionately, but we can also use those stories to encourage others. That\u2019s what my friends, Bryan and Jenny, have done and today the three of us have worked together to help tell their story (from Bryan's point of view).\nBryan and I grew up going to school together and he was like a fourth brother to me. This past year of he and Jenny\u2019s lives have been amazing to watch. Theirs is a story \u2013 not about religion, but about finding a relationship the One Who offers to exchange a life that is worthless for one filled with hope and joy.\nIf you or someone you know is at a place where your marriage seems hopeless, read this. It is an amazing example of what God wants to do with broken lives.\nIt was 2005 when Jenny was first diagnosed with Bi-Polar. That was the beginning of... well, almost the end. The effects it had on Jenny physically and mentally were devastating. Jenny felt that she had lost her identity, and that her old \"self\" was lost. She was ashamed and embarrassed. She didn't want anyone to know. She had to leave her job since she felt she was no longer useful. She thought of herself as being a drain to the company - unable to perform productively. At the time she was angry at God for allowing this to happen to her. It took a long time for Jenny to finally accept her diagnosis.\nThe Bi Polar was hard on our marriage, and it affected every aspect of our lives. I had to apply for FMLA time at work to be able to help care for Jenny. After a couple of months, I ended up losing my job. The costs of Jenny\u2019s medications were astronomical without insurance, thus adding more stress to our struggling marriage. I didn't think it could get much worse. Instead of turning to God as I knew I should, I just dove deeper into a bottle, trying to numb the stress through my addiction to alcohol.\nAs our lives continued spiraling downhill, we were faced with yet another devastation. A former friend of mine began telling Jenny that I was cheating on her. She didn\u2019t believe him at first, but over time he was able to break down her trust in me. In the end, he convinced her that the best way to retaliate was by having an affair with him.\nThe damage an affair has on a marriage and family is indescribable. I lost all of my self-esteem, my self-worth. My trust and respect for Jenny was gone. She, on the other hand, was filled with guilt and shame. She felt betrayed knowing he had taken advantage of her at a weak time in her life. Not only that, she felt hatred towards herself for being, as she called it, \u201cstupid enough to believe his lies\u201d.\nAs she struggled with her private pain, I struggled with mine. I lost all trust for others and began to build walls of self-defense in an effort to block every one out of my life on a personal level. I couldn't trust anyone and I felt betrayed and alone. My anger raged inside me, and the only thing that kept me from doing what I instantly wanted to do, was God intervening. He kept reminding me of my boys and that killing that guy \u2013 or even hurting him, was not worth the risk of losing my boys.\nI thank God still that He was intervening even then in the midst of all of our sin. He had a plan for us and He was laying the ground work through all of this, to bring us back to Him! Looking back, I can't believe the grip my alcoholism had on me and I continually sought comfort in it instead of God.\nIn the meantime, Jenny continued to struggle. As the burden of guilt and shame began to weigh her down, so did the pain from the realization that her actions had had a profound impact on our kids, our family and our friends. She didn't realize the pain would ripple through all aspects of our lives like the tidal wave of a tsunami.\nWe look back now and see two people who had little to live for. Our world had crumbled into a wasteland of ruins. We had hit bottom.\nI knew all along what we needed to do, I had turned my back on God since I was 18 years old, yet even after all the sin we had committed, God didn't give up on us! It was while living in that wasteland of devastation and despair that God came knocking. Out of the blue, my two childhood friends, Tobey Schwartz and Joel Troyer began inviting me to go to church with them. At first I turned them down, but eventually their persistence paid off. I\u2019ll never forget the first time I entered that building. The Spirit of God overwhelmed me when I walked through those doors for the first time. It was as if He ran to embrace me, His prodigal son, as He welcomed me to a new life of hope and joy.\nIt was January 23, 2011 when I rededicated my life to God. My life had been redeemed!! I was able to let go of my hurt and anger and in my relationship with Jesus, I found peace like I had never experienced before.\nI began begging God to work in Jenny\u2019s life - to save her also from the chains that the devil had us bound in for so many years! I wanted this redemption and freedom for her as well!\nOn March 13, 2011 Jenny couldn't take anymore. She had seen what God was doing in me and wanted the same for herself. That day for the first time in our marriage, we walked through the doors of FFM with the same desire - for God to save her and our marriage.\nJenny carried with her that day a great deal of fear and shame of her past, and was afraid what people would think of her She worried that she wouldn\u2019t be worthy of God\u2019s forgiveness. As soon as we walked into the sanctuary, she said she felt God\u2019s hand reaching down to her. She thought that if she could just raise her hand to His and ask for forgiveness and salvation, perhaps He would set her free from the burden she\u2019d been carrying for so long.\nDuring the worship service Jenny felt the presence of God reach down and take her hand. She lifted her arms in surrender to Him and in that moment all the chains fell off! The burdens\u2026 the shame\u2026 the guilt were all washed away!!! She recognized the love that He had for her \u2013 the desire to give her a life worth living. That day she accepted God\u2019s gift of grace and mercy. She no longer was worried what people thought of her, she knew she had been redeemed!\nSince that day, our marriage and lives have been blessed in so many ways! God has been there for us to lean on. Later that summer, Jenny was baptized. Our marriage isn't perfect, but compared to where it was and where God has brought us is nothing but a divine miracle.\nGod has helped us in our ability to forgive each other and work through our problems and disagreements. Jenny's motto for us is \"Forgiveness is an unnatural act, but by the grace of God we have become supernatural\".\nGod has healed our broken marriage and restored our family. We still have trials and short comings \u2013 we\u2019re certainly not perfect, but with God in our lives, we have His power to help us overcome so much more. We grow daily in Him and He sustains us through it all! We are blessed beyond measure!\nIf you would like to share your story or request prayer for your marriage, you can contact me here. I will forward your words of encouragement on to Bryan and Jenny as well."

                            "text": "She was exhausted. She had been sitting in her chair for hours; listening to couples pour out their hearts, talking about their problems, their differences and their fears. After the session with her last client she finally stood up and stretched. Her shoulders were aching and the backache had returned as well. She walked to the bathroom and opened the medicine cabinet, gulped down a painkiller with a glass of water.\nShe looked at the mirror, a tired woman in her late thirties stared back at her. She removed her wrist watch and rolled up the sleeves of her white shirt. She splashed cold water over her face; she felt better as the cold water relaxed her tired nerves. She decided to extend the relaxation area to her shoulders and neck. She unbuttoned her shirt and took it off; hanging it on the hook on the door she picked up the face towel and held it under the tap. Placing the soaked towel on her aching shoulders she closed her eyes and tried visiting her happy place. The cold water felt better than hot water that most of the people preferred. She repeated the process on the other shoulder and her neck. Feeling rejuvenated she put on her shirt and walked out of the bathroom. Visiting her happy place had elevated her mood despite the bad sessions she had.\nTwo of her clients were on the verge of getting a divorce. They had finally confirmed their decision despite her attempts to try and mend things between them. The truth was, it was not possible for her to help them if they did not want to help themselves. It made no sense trying to do the thinking, figuring out and convincing on their part. The couple had to interact and actively participate in the session. On one hand she was glad in a way that one of the couples were finally getting a divorce. Their relationship was beyond repair; they deserved to be happy but sadly it was not with each other.\nOn the other hand she felt sad for the other couple who were getting divorced \u2013 the husband was a PTSD patient, a war hero. He had done all that he could to save the relationship but his wife had given up on him.\nPerhaps the stress she felt in her shoulders was a result of her involvement with this client. Usually, she tried her best not to get too involved with her clients but it was different with this man. She felt sorry for the soldier; the man deserved to be happy but she could not blame his wife, either. She deserved to be happy as well. His nightmares were making her nervous, her patience had finally snapped when he had tried to strangulate her in his sleep as he was having a nightmare.\nSome relationships are not meant to be. She thought about this advice her friend had given her. While she was a successful counsellor she could not save herself from the experience of a failed relationship. For a long time she had allowed her marriage to wear her down. She had given everything she could to the relationship. Instead of accepting that they were not compatible she had tried her level best to come up to the mark, make herself compatible with her husband. The failing relationship had started affecting her work. When she had talked to her friend regarding her marriage, her friend had told her that her relationship was one of those which were not meant to be. It did not make sense holding on to something that was going to slip away eventually. The only best part of the relationship was her six year old daughter. The little girl was her happy place. Whenever she felt stressed she thought about her little girl.\nShe knew that getting a divorce would be easy since her husband wanted out as well but she was worried about her daughter. She was afraid of the custody battle and the effect it would have on the innocent girl. Thankfully, even that had been a smooth ride. When she had asked for custody, he had willingly agreed to it. He did not want any part in the responsibility. Even though she was happy to have complete custody of her daughter; she hated the man for giving up so easily on their daughter.\nIt had been two years since they had been officially divorced but it seemed like yesterday whenever she thought about it.\nBeing in this profession had not allowed her to get rid of her past easily. Whenever she came across cases where divorce was inevitable, it reminded her of her own failed relationship. Today was one such day.\nShe tried to convince herself that her divorce had been a happy event in her life.\nShe cleaned her desk and kept the case files in the top drawer. Picking up the keys she walked towards the door. It was time to go home. She closed the office and walked to her car in the parking lot. She inserted a CD in the music system and started the ignition. She reached home after a twenty minute drive. She slowed down as she reached her bungalow and looked towards the window on the ground floor. She saw a silhouette standing at the window and as she parked in the driveway she saw the curtains being closed and a moment later the main door was opened even before she could climb out of the car.\nHe walked a few steps towards her. She got down from the car and smiled at him. Walking closer to him, she thought how lucky she was to have been given a second chance. She wrapped her arms around him and kissed him. They walked back inside the house together. Her daughter who was watching her favourite cartoon got up and ran towards her. She got down on her knees and gave her daughter a tight hug. From the corner of her eyes she saw him staring at her. She loved the way he stared at her. She could read his expression and she was glad that she could. These expressions made it possible for her to stay strong and not get weighed down by the sessions with her clients.\nHe was her second happy place.\nShe had met him a year after her divorce and he had been her life support. He understood her, he accepted her mood swings, he handled her anger, and he managed bringing her out of the depression of her failed first marriage and most importantly he promised her a better future."

Telling him that he doesn\u2019t need to be parted with her once he divorces Li Xiuying. Truth to be told, he was felt sorry for the woman that has been his wife for five long years. He felt sorry for Li Xiuying who still think that they\u2019re still happily married.\nStanding in front of the door, Mu Jianyu hesitated for a moment, asking himself one more time if this is the best thing he should do. Shaking his head to push the doubts out of his mind, he opened the door.\nHe was right. Li Xiuying was waiting for him as usual. She was sitting on their living room, watching a comedy show, still wearing her work clothes that reek with the smell of paint. Li Xiuying was a well-known artist, with most of her earnings ending up to charities and orphanage.\nHer hair is a mess. The scent of paint lingers on her clothes. She looked so plain unlike his Lin Meirong. She always smelled good and beautiful in his eyes.\n\u201cWelcome home, honey!\u201d Li Xiuying happily greeted him when she saw him at the door. She came towards him and helped him removed his coat. \u201cHow\u2019s your meeting?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright. Nothing special happened.\u201d Lies.\n\u201cAre you hungry? I can reheat the dinner if you want to. Why don\u2019t you take a shower first while I do that?\u201d she said with a smile.\nMu Jianyu said nothing to her. He wasn\u2019t hungry. He already had dinner with Lin Meirong earlier and he couldn\u2019t tell his wife that he was sick of pretending everything is okay whenever he sees her smile.\nBut still, he said nothing and did what she told him to do. For the last time, he accompanied his wife for dinner. They ate in silence, something both of them already get used to. As soon as he finished his meal, he left her on the dining table and went to their bedroom.\nHe came back with a folder in his hand.\nMu Jianyu found her cleaning the table and had put the dirty dishes on the sink. She lifted her gaze on him when he came back. Noticing the seriousness written all over his face, Li Xiuying sat back on her chair.\nSeeing her concern, Mu Jianyu faltered a bit. How could he ask her for a divorce like this? She was there, waiting for him to say something and yet he knew that once those words had been said, she will be left broken. He felt like there was a lump stuck on his throat and he couldn\u2019t utter a single word.\nHe forgot that he was still holding the divorce papers in his hand. It was then he realized that Li Xiuying took the papers from him without his permission.\nMu Jianyu watched his wife\u2019s expression changed from being happy to shock. The smile she had earlier vanished instantly as she read the contents of the paper.\nAt that moment, Li Xiuying thought her world has fallen apart. She felt like someone just stabbed her directly in her heart.\nHe cannot back out anymore. His wife already knew his intention to divorce her.\n\u201cI don\u2019t love you anymore.\u201d Mu Jianyu said without hesitation."

She thought of days when she hung her bag across her shoulders and gleefully ran across the lawns to the block of classes. Days when she raised her hands at every single question whether she knew it or not, all because she wanted to compete with Dan Usman, the bright kid from the next village. Her mind remembered days when she played with the others from her colony before departure to their various homes. She cherished all of that and not this prisoner\u2019s experience she was passing through.\nShe tried to get up and gain some balance but pains at the lower part of her abdomen coupled with that of strikes of belt on her body reminded her of something she never wished to remember. Fresh hot tears began wetting her eyelashes again and she sunk into the bed, letting out the cry of agony bottled within her. A glance at the clock made her wish it would just stop working and grant her the pleasure of enjoying her bitterness for that moment before her nightmare begins to think of her. Little did she know he was closer than ever, only this time, harmless.\nA crack from the door jerked her out of her sleep. Ralia looked puzzled for a minute at the figures standing few metres from her bed. Uncle Danjuma she knew, Aunty Moni she also knew, but who are the two others in uniform gripping uncle\u2019s hand from behind? A beckon from aunty Moni sent cold shivers down her spine and she reluctantly stayed put. But a second, this time, garnished with a smile made Ralia look into uncle\u2019s face for approval but she got nothing but a hard, stern looking expression from him. Ignoring it, she got out of bed and dragged her feet towards aunty Moni. Oh! What feeling of paradise she got as aunty Moni coiled her hands around her and gently caressed her cheeks as she was led out of the building. She felt loved! She felt accepted! She had never felt this way all her life. Her feeling of pleasure was heightened when Aunty Moni began to say sweet words to her, assuring her of her eternal freedom.\nTruly, she never knew what Aunty Moni, the seemingly distant next door neighbor had done for her until she saw Uncle Danjuma whisked in handcuffs into the white police van. It was truly a season of fresh hopes and aspirations for her afterwards. It was a period of freedom from Uncle\u2019s constant abuse and whips of the belt, she then began to feel like a human being again and not an object of sexual gratification and constant torture.\n#I stand with NO to child marriage!\n#I say, stop child abuse!"

There, thanks to a shortage of space in the midst of a flood of violent injuries, they share the same bed.\nSospeter Odipo, a Luo, said he doesn\u2019t mind sharing a bed with fellow flower-farmer Peter Ndungu, a Kikuyu, but he says he can no longer live alongside Kikuyus. He plans to return to Kisumu in his western tribal homeland.\nOutside the hospital gates, their communities fire arrows and chuck rocks at each other in the latest post-poll clash.\nA month or so ago, few could have believed the tension exposed by elections in a country best known for tourism would prompt conflict that has killed 1,000, displaced 300,000 and been called \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d by the United States and others.\n\u201cIt was there the whole time but people didn\u2019t want to acknowledge it,\u201d said Paul Brennan, a missionary who has worked in Kenya for the last 30 years.\nThe trigger was disputed polls that returned Kibaki to power. Odinga says Kibaki rigged it. But the seeds of the conflict were sown long ago.\nPolitics, land and ethnicity have combined before to spill into violence. Clashes in the early and the late 90s also caused the deaths of hundreds, mostly Kikuyus, in the Rift Valley.\nResentment of the Kikuyu stems even further back, to perceptions that they were favored by colonial power Britain and \u2014 as shrewd businessmen and women \u2014 then emerged from the country\u2019s 42 tribes as the most influential, analysts say.\nCrowded in central Kenya and encouraged by the independent nation\u2019s first president, himself a Kikuyu, they moved on to and bought land from other groups in the Rift Valley.\n\u201cThey say we stole their land. We didn\u2019t. We bought it,\u201d said Jane Nyaga, 55, a retired Kikuyu teacher, as she sat on her only remaining possession, a sofa, near a police station sheltering refugees. A mob from another tribe, the Kalenjin, burnt her house.\nWhat started as the opposition\u2019s rejection of the election has spread \u2014 fuelled, many say, by politicians or elders mobilizing gangs to protect their local interests.\nProtests in urban areas were as much about the gap between rich and poor as they were politics, some Kenyans say. But they were met with a tough police response, igniting resentment.\nWhen the violence reached Naivasha \u2014 just north of Nairobi \u2014 last week, it was mostly Kikuyus who were retaliating for attacks on their own in western Kenya after Kibaki\u2019s victory was announced.\nHundreds of youths from the Kalenjin and Kisii tribes battled last Sunday in Chebilat, near Kericho town, shooting arrows and slingshots as each side accused the other of chasing them off their land.\nThe result, said Francois Grignon, Africa Director for the International Crisis Group, has been the collapse of state legitimacy. \u201cThe institutions of the state are being rejected. They are not playing their role so people are resorting to violence,\u201d he told Reuters.\nMany Kenyans, disgusted by the bloodshed, pin their hopes on talks between the two leaders\u2019 parties in Nairobi.\nMeanwhile, in Eldoret, also in the west, a successful Kikuyu businessman who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals said he was tearing up plans to retire there and heading home generations after his family arrived.\nWhen clashes permit, buses, trucks and cars load up at makeshift camps, piled high with furniture before crisscrossing the country, ferrying thousands of Kenyans back to homelands.\nKikuyus from the west are heading to Central Kenya. Luos, Luhyas and Kalenjins and heading back westwards.\nAs much as the displaced may consider these ethnic tribelands home, Grignon warned they may face more struggles if many return to overpopulated regions where unemployment is high.\n\u201cIt is going to be a major issue that will require some serious political negotiations and people with large tracts of land giving some up,\u201d he said."

                            "text": "Parshat Matot seems to consist of a number of non-sequiturs.\nIt begins with a discourse on the laws of oaths. The heads of the tribes -- roshei matot -- are gathered together to receive these laws, hence the name of the portion.\nNext, the Torah calls for vengeance against the Midianites, for their crime against the people of Israel. The wrath of Israel is centered around Balaam who attempted to curse the Children of Israel and who, we are told, \"died by the sword.\" The Torah goes on to describe the ensuing battle, and the spoils of war with which the victorious army returns.\nThe subsequent section tells about the tribes of Reuben and Gad, who requested that they be allotted the grazing land outside of Israel, on the east bank of the Jordan River, in order to accommodate their very large herds. Moses chastises them for this request, and an arrangement is reached whereby these tribes will aid their brethren in the conquest, and only afterwards return to their lands across the River. The Torah adds that half of the tribe of Menashe, son of Joseph, will join them.\nThe connection with the laws of oaths, brought at this particular junction, is not immediately clear; however, this specific issue may be the link between the various topics covered in this Torah portion. As we shall see, the importance of one's word -- or indeed the power of the word -- is the common denominator.\nIt seems quite strange that two tribes are willing to form an allegiance and avoid entering the Land of Israel.\nThis last episode, involving the tribes of Reuben and Gad, deserves further attention. It seems quite strange that two tribes are willing to form an allegiance and avoid entering the Land of Israel. Yet these tribes have a number of things in common.\nFirst, they are both first-born to their respective mothers, Leah and Leah's maidservant Zilpah. Second, they have a common marching formation -- the two were in the same group, and when they marched they surrounded the tribe of Shimon. According to the Midrash, these two tribes were exceptionally wealthy, and therefore preferred to remain in the greener pastures outside the Land of Israel.\nFurthermore, the Midrash sees the section dealing with the spoils of war as directed against these two tribes, as if to say \"if it is money which you seek, God has many ways of providing.\"\nThe message is subtle but clear: Owning cattle is fine, but do not for a second place material wealth above one's children. How could these people have their values so confused?\nThere was a disproportionate frequency of bloodshed in this territory on the east bank of the Jordan.\nThere is a tradition, brought down in the Talmud (Makot 10a), that there was a disproportionate frequency of bloodshed in this territory. The obvious implication is that there was some sort of moral breakdown in that society. Something was wrong with the educational setup if people did not know how to take precautions which could save lives.\nThis is a further indication of the bizarre value system, which favored possessions over children. By the time the fighters from these tribes returned from the years of conquest and division of the land, an entire generation was raised without the benefit of their fathers. No wonder basic safety precautions were not taken. No wonder human life lost it value. After all, it was only people -- not cattle.\nWe can see how the moral breakdown echoed in the request of the two-and-a-half tribes affected the future, but what was its origin?\nIn Genesis we see Reuben standing out on a number of occasions. One such instance is at the sale of Joseph, where he heroically jumps into the fray and attempts to save Joseph from his tormentors. At that particular point in the text, Reuben's motivation escapes us. Only later, when Joseph was sold by the others and without Reuben's knowledge, we find out.\nWhat may have seemed like a noble gesture turned out to be merely an expression of Reuben's responsibility as the eldest son. If something happened to Joseph, he felt that he would surely pay the price.\nLater, as the story unfolds and the Egyptian vizier demands to see Benjamin before providing more food, Reuben offers that his own sons be killed in the event that Benjamin is not returned unscathed to Jacob.(See Genesis 42:37.) Needless to say, Jacob rejects this bizarre offer, but one can not help but wonder what type of effect this had on these children, knowing that their father was willing to exchange them.\nPerhaps we can take this question one step further: What motivated Reuben's offer? Perhaps he suspected that because of his various indiscretions, he stood to lose the double portion of the first-born, and this offer was a gamble which could win that double portion back. He was willing to place his own children on the table as \"markers\" in this game of \"high-risk poker.\"\nReuben does not seem to have placed a very high value on the lives of his children.\nWhether or not this is the case, the fact remains that Reuben does not seem to have placed a very high value on the lives of his children. We therefore should not be all that surprised when Reuben's descendants prioritize in a similar fashion, i.e., possessions before children.\nPerhaps these three, once united, commiserated on the inequity of losing the rights associated with being the older brother. Perhaps their pact was solidified around the decision to remain outside of the land which should have been theirs, more than anyone else's.\nAfter striking of the rock, Moses knew that he could not enter the Land of Israel; thus was the will of God, the word of God. But even so, could God not break his own vow? The portion of Gad and Reuben was not part of the land, but one day it would be. Therefore, if they were to stay on the east side of the Jordan -- where Moses was permitted to enter -- and go on to fulfill their side of the deal, then their portion achieves the same status as the rest of the Land of Israel, and effectively God's vow is nullified, because Moses had in fact entered the land.\nMoses teaches the laws and intricacies of oaths. One important part of these laws is that oaths can be challenged and rescinded.\nOnce the tribes of Reuben and Gad hear this, they devise a plan for Moses to join them in Israel. If the vow precluding Moses' entrance to Israel could be reversed, then perhaps the loss of the double portion of Reuben can also be reversed.\nMoses, for his part, does not seem interested in subterfuge. He continues his mission -- what is to be his last task. He takes immediate steps to fulfill the Divine order to seek vengeance against Midian.\nDelaying the battle and, as a result, his own demise, would have caused the Children of Israel to linger in the desert. Instead, Moses sets off on his final mission, even though its completion will drawn his own death nearer. Even one unnecessary day in the desert was too high a price to be paid; the welfare of the nation always came before personal considerations, and Moses immediately, heroically, sends Joshua to battle the Midianites.\nAccording to this Midrash, Moses himself makes the suggestion that he remain in the portion of Gad and Reuben. God explains that such an arrangement is impossible. If Moses were alive and remained in Jordan during the major holidays, who would go to Israel when they could be with Moses?\nA person like Moses can not simply retire and slip out of the public eye. God explains that ultimately such an arrangement would destroy the Torah.\nMoses surely does not want to be party to any suggestion which would have a negative effect on the people or the Torah. And therefore, he carries out God's order without delay whatever the consequences to himself.\nMoses's approach differs from that of Gad and Reuben in that Moses does not seek to harm the integrity of the Torah, or the Jewish people, whereas Reuben and Gad's suggestion ultimately harmed their own children.\nThe earlier indiscretion of Reuben himself, when he intimated that his children were expendable, reemerges to harm his descendants.\nBe it motivated by their love of money, or their twisted love for Moses, the result of parents letting their children know that they are not their most valued \"possession,\" proved disastrous for these tribes. Children inevitably learn from the actions and values of their parents.\nTherefore, the east bank of the Jordan River became a place of violence and bloodshed, and the children of these tribes were the first to be exiled.\nThank you for this fantastic insight into these topics. It was fascinating to see the psychological link between the tribes' actions and their ancestors experiences. I enjoyed reading this excellent article.\nAbsolutely wonderful article with the most amazing insights!\nI often wonder why, when Reuben and Gad made their request of Moses, why he did not go to God for a solution. When the daughters of Zelophehad approached Moses regarding their father's portion, Moses saught God's intervention. Could things have been different had these two and a half tribes gone over the Jordan along with the rest of the tribes?\nI think the two circumstances are very different. Rashi (if my memory serves), comments that the answer to the B'nos Tz'lofchad's question was hidden from Moshe, because the daughters were worthy to have the Parsha written in their name, and were demonstrating love of Eretz Yisrael. The two tribes, however, were--at least on a superficial understanding--were demonstrating (again, Apparently), an unwillingness to go into the Land. In this situation, Moshe had to act immediately to assure that a rebellion, similar to what happened with the return of the Spies from seeing the Land, and who spoke derogitorily about the Land.\nHow did Reuven and Gad amass so much cattle? And why did other tribes not do so? Wouldn't we assume that the booty of Mitzrayim, from Yam Suf and from Sichon, Og, Balak etc was shared equally? How then did these two tribes (and perhaps, that of Menashe as well?) have a disproportionate share?"

Now, Tavi must find a way to overcome the centuries-old animosities between Aleran and Cane if an alliance is to be forged against their mutual enemy. And he must lead his legion in defiance of the law, against friend and foe-before the hammerstroke of the Vord descends on them all.\nWhile Tavi had no experience in military before joining the First Aleran, now it would be hard to find anyone that people would trust as much as him. Though the Canim represent a significant threat, Tavi knows that there is a way to end the fighting and bloodshed. The trust between a leader who goes with their men and the warriors is accurately represented here, and many who have been in a situation with a trusted leader would likely agree.\nUnfortunately this book was very heavy in fighting without as much interaction that wasn\u2019t in the field. There were a lot of frustrating moments when things go wrong, and the sadness Tavi feels over consequences of his tactics can be felt by the reader. Nevertheless, one cannot help but want to know exactly what happens to Tavi of Calderon."

                            "text": "For those who remember the sometimes ugly incidents over Native American Great Lakes fishing rights in the 1970s, the recent agreement on hunting, fishing and gathering on inland areas ends what has been a long, but relatively peaceful, struggle to define the extent of treaty rights.\nThe treaty of 1836 offered inland rights to area Native Americans when it came to hunting, fishing and gathering. The question became, what are the limits?\nFor decades, the tribes believed that these inland rights were still valid and that they did not need to adhere to state hunting and fishing laws and regulations. Some tribes adopted their own hunting and fishing regulations for their members. It made for a few skirmishes between tribal members and state conservation officers, with, frankly, no one wanting to go to court to set the limits there.\nSo the United States, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and the five recognized tribes in the treaty area - Bay Mills Indian Community, the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians and the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians - hammered out the agreement.\nThe agreement covers 13,837,207 acres of lands and inland waters within the boundaries of the 1836 treaty area. In that treaty, the tribes retained the rights when signing away ownership of the 1836 treaty lands, about 37 percent of the land in the state.\nOf special note is tribal members may engage in hunting, fishing, and gathering activities on tribal lands and lands that are open to the public for those activities. The decree does not open private land for such activities without permission of land owners, which over the years was a fear of many.\nThe agreement also bans gill nets and snagging on inland waters, and no commercial fishing is permitted in inland lakes.\nThere are some who may complain about longer seasons and larger bag limits for tribal members, but on the whole, the agreement is a well-reasoned pact that should be viable for years to come.\nWork well done by all."

                            "text": "For more than 10,000 years the Takelma peoples lived in a vast area of southern Oregon encompassing Table Rocks. Their close neighbors were the Athapaskan, Molalla and Shasta tribes who they traded and had political relations with. The region of these tribes included the Table Rocks area (Rogue River Valley) which was the traditional homelands of the Takelma tribe. The Takelma were divided by the upland Takelma and valley Takelma. They were the original Rogue River Tribe who lived along the Rogue River and Illinois rivers. They became one of the \u201cRogue River tribes\u201d along with the Athapaskan (Chasta Costa), and Shasta who joined together in a confederacy to defend their homelands from newcomer settlers and miners who did not respect the previous tribal claims to the land. From the late 1840s until about 1857, there were numerous conflicts and battles in the area between the Rogue River tribes and the newcomers. The culmination of the early conflicts were the treaties of 1853 and 1854 with some of the Rogue River tribes that ceded millions of acres of land to the United States in exchange for peace, safety, and a permanent reservation.\nBefore a permanent reservation was organized, the Rogue River tribes were temporarily removed to the Table Rock Reservation. The reservation encompassed Lower Table Rock, half of Upper Table Rock and a wide expanse of the valleys and canyons in between along the Rogue River. Settler militias chose to continue to attack the tribes on the reservation in an attempt to exterminate all Indians in southern Oregon. Some of the most powerful tribes chose to form a confederacy and leave the reservation to protect themselves, and fought a series of pitched battles through the Siskiyou Mountains where many people on both sides were killed.\nIn 1855, the United States Army under General John E. Wool (Commander of the Pacific) and the Indian Superintendent of Oregon, Joel Palmer, acted to separate the combatants permanently and the Grand Ronde Indian Reservation was opened in the western Willamette Valley in January of 1856. The first tribes to arrive were the local Kalapuyans, and the Umpqua tribes arrived in late February. The peaceful tribes who remained on the Table Rock Reservation were marched in the dead of winter, over 300 miles to the new encampment \u2013 the Grand Ronde Indian Reservation- between February and March 1856. The tribal story tells of how seven people died on the removal, while seven babies were born. The tribes were harassed by settlers all the way to the reservation, and while at the reservation they were settled along the South Yamhill River. These removals are known as the Grand Ronde \u201cTrails of Tears.\u201d In the summer of that year, the remaining tribes surrendered and were shipped to Grand Ronde and locations along the coast. In 1857, the Grand Ronde Reservation became a permanent reservation by presidential executive order.\nIn 1857, about 2/3rds of the Rogue Tribe were removed to the newly opened Siletz Agency on the Coast Reservation. To Grand Ronde remained some 27 other tribes from the Willamette Valley, the Columbia River, the Umpqua valley and the Cascade range. Many descendants of the western Oregon tribes are at two reservations, Grand Ronde and Siletz, and they possess native ancestral bloodlines from five or more of the tribes of Oregon.\nTecumtum (Chief John), was a Rogue River Indian leader in the mid-1800s who lived at nearby Deer Creek. Tecumtum was the Principle Chief of the Etch-ka-taw-wah band of Takelma. He was known to the area\u2019s miners and settlers as \u201cChief John\u201d, \u201cTyee John\u201d and \u201cElk Killer\u201d. Tecumtum signed two treaties with the United States as Principle Chief of his tribe, the Treaty with the Rogue River 1853 and the Treaty with the Rogue River 1854. Tecumtum, after a brief removal to the Table Rock Reservation was forced to defend his people and flee the reservation after attacks by area settlers. Tecumtum and his band remained in the Coast Range fighting pitched battles and was the last of the area\u2019s Native headmen to surrender to the U. S. Army near the confluence of the Rogue and Illinois rivers in the spring of 1856. Tecumtum and his band were marched overland along the coast trail to the Coast Reservation in the summer of 1856.\nAfter their removal, and some years had passed, Tecumtum found that many of his people were dying of white men\u2019s diseases and the promises made by the Americans had not come to his people on the reservation. It appeared to be that the tribes responsible for leaving the reservation and fighting the Americans had been removed to Siletz, that the government believed they had breached the terms of the treaty, to remain peaceful, and therefore no longer were owed treaty payments. But if this is so, the Americans did not recognize the pressure the tribes were under at the Table Rock Reservation, when the volunteer militias continued to attack and kill the Rogue River people in a series of attempts at extermination. It remains to be determined which party violated the terms of the treaty first. However the tribes at Siletz did not have treaty funding and they had to depend on the annual appropriations of Congress for funding for the Reservation of over 2000 people. So, Tecumtum used powerful oratory to plead (unsuccessfully) to his fellow Tribal peoples to be allowed to return to his \u201cDeer Creek home\u201d by escaping in the night. His son killed a shaman and because of the agitation on the reservation by his family, he and his son were arrested to be sent to prison. In 1862, after a long imprisonment at The Presidio in San Francisco, Tecumtum returned to Oregon to live at the Grand Ronde Reservation with his daughters who had appealed for his release. Tecumtum died on June 6, 1864 at the Grand Ronde Reservation.\nFrom time immemorial, the native peoples have live here and utilized the environment to live a good life. The Takelma of the Rogue valley lived within the acorn culture, where they would gather and process acorn mush every year. They also gathered camas, manzanita berries and huckleberries and weaving materials. The tribes were weavers and hunters and fishers and lived a very good life. They would utilize plankhouses and river canoes for travelling. They primarily hunted with a bow and were expert marksmen.\nDuring summer, families traveled to the cooler, forested uplands and harvested berries, dug camas, hunted and fished. When autumn arrived, people returned to the winter plankhouses and begin harvesting acorns from the plentiful oaks. During winter, men hunted for deer and elk and fished for steelhead trout. The people lived off the dried and stored abundance of the summer\u2019s harvest. Spring was a time for gathering, Weaving materials were ready for harvest and animals and fish were newly arriving for the season.\nWhen the tribes were moved from their lands, they changed their lifeways forever.\nThese essays were written for another project with the Medford BLM. They have since been edited."

                            "text": "Ethnic diversity in what is now the southeastern United States did not begin with European contact. When Europeans first began to build permanent settlements in the Choctaw region (roughly 300 years ago), it was already a multi-ethnic place, occupied by complex, numerous, and diverse Native American tribes. Our ancestors were a product of this diversity, many of them spoke multiple tribal languages, knew multiple tribal customs, and had family members from other neighboring tribes. Formalized relationships with these tribes were carefully negotiated by Choctaw leaders and helped to define the course of Choctaw and southeastern history. This month, Iti Fabvssa takes a look at some of the tribes that were our neighbors 300 years ago, and briefly examines where they are today.\nChickasaw - In 1700, the Chickasaw were living about 100 miles north of Choctaw territory. Both Chickasaw and Choctaw oral stories indicate that the two tribes were once part of the same group. It is no surprise that the Chickasaw and Choctaw language are mutually understandable and the tribes are close culturally. Yet, by 300 years ago, the Choctaw and Chickasaw had become bitter enemies. The Choctaw (allied with the French) and the Chickasaw (allied with the English) fought each other regularly. Lasting peace was made in 1759. In 1837, the Chickasaw moved in with the Choctaws in Indian Territory (Oklahoma). In 1855, the Choctaw Nation ceded lands for the establishment of the Chickasaw Nation to our west. This is where Chickasaw Nation is still located today.\nAlabama - 300 years ago, the Alabama lived to the east of the Choctaw, on the Alabama River. Several generations earlier they had lived in what is now Mississippi. Like the Chickasaws, the Alabama have a language and culture that are similar to the Choctaw, and according to some oral traditions all three tribes were once a part of the same group. The Alabama tribe's name may come from the Choctaw phrase \"Alba Amo,\" meaning \"Vegetation-Gatherers\" (Halbert 1899:65). During the French colonial period, the Alabama were often allied with the English and regularly fought against the Choctaw. Today the Alabama Coushatta tribe of Texas lives near the town of Livingston, and the Alabama Quassarte tribal town is located within the Muscogee \"Creek\" Nation in Oklahoma. Tohome/Naniaba- In the early 1700s, the Tohome and Naniaba tribes lived to the southeast of the Choctaw, on the Tombigbee River, above its confluence with the Alabama River.\nTohome/Naniaba language and culture were similar or identical to Choctaw language and culture of the time period, although the Tohome were said to have darker skin than the Choctaw (Waselkov and Gums 2000). These two small tribes were closely allied with the Choctaw, and allowed Choctaw people to stay in their villages when they were processing salt from nearby springs. In the 1760s, the Tohome/Naniaba joined the Choctaw tribe, so today, some Choctaw tribal members are descended from the Tohome and Naniaba.\nMobila - The Mobila were a slightly larger tribe that lived on Mobile Bay in 1700. Under Chief Tvshkalusa, they had fought and crippled an invading Spanish army under Hernando DeSoto, 160 years earlier. The Mobila language was very similar Choctaw, and they had a close political alliance with the Choctaw. The name \"Mobila\" may come from the Choctaw word \"Moieli\", meaning \"To Paddle\" (Halbert 1899:68). Mobile, Alabama, derives its name from the tribe. In the 1760s, some of the Mobila tribe joined the Choctaw, others moved on to Louisiana. Some of today's Choctaw people are descended from the Mobila.\nPensacola - The name \"Pensacola\" comes from the Choctaw phrase \"Pvshi Okla,\" meaning \"Hair People\" (Swanton 1952:136). This tribe lived around Pensacola Bay in the Florida panhandle. The Pensacola spoke a Muscogean dialect, and in 1700 were fighting against the Mobila and later against the Choctaws. A few years afterwards, the Pensacola moved to the Pearl River and then vanished from recorded history (Waselkov and Gumm 2000:21-23).\nPascagoula - The Pascagoula lived to the south of the Choctaws. The two tribes were on good terms and their connectedness is shown through similar pottery designs. The name \"Pascagoula\" comes from the Choctaw term \"Pvlaska Okla,\" meaning \"Bread People.\" In the late 1700s, the Pascagoula moved west, and today some of their descendants are among several Oklahoma/Texas tribes today.\nBiloxi - The Biloxi are a Siouan-speaking tribe that may have originated in the Ohio River Valley. In 1700, they lived on the Pascagoula River, south of the Pascagoula tribe. Some Biloxi descendants moved to Texas and Oklahoma, others amalgamated with the Tunica tribe. Today, their descendants make up the Tunica-Biloxi tribe of Louisiana.\nHouma - The tribe's name comes from the Choctaw word \"Homa,\" meaning \"Red.\" The Houma are linguistically and culturally related to the Choctaw. In 1700, they lived on the east bank of the Mississippi River, across from the mouth of the Red River. In 1706, after an attack by the Tunica, the tribe moved to the New Orleans area. Today, thousands of Houma descendants live in Louisiana.\nAcolapissa - The tribe's name comes from the Choctaw phrase \"Haklo Pisa,\" meaning \"Hears and Sees.\" In 1700, this tribe lived on the Pearl River, to the southwest of the Choctaw. Culturally and linguistically related to the Choctawan groups, after a series of movements, they merged with the Houma.\nNatchez - The Natchez lived on the Mississippi River to the west of the Choctaw. They spoke their own language and were noted for their centralized political structure After repeated affronts by the French, the Natchez attacked and routed the local French settlement in 1730. In retaliation, the French, and their Choctaw allies decimated the Natchez tribe. Survivors were sold into slavery or fled to English-Allied tribes for asylum. Today, some individuals living among the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, the Muscogee \"Creek\" Nation, and the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma identify themselves as Natchez.\nTunica - The Tunica were living near the mouth of the Yazzoo River in 1700. In 1706, they moved in with the Houma and attacked them. In the late 1700s, Tunica moved to the Marksville area of Louisiana. Today, their descendants make up part of the Tunica-Biloxi tribe of Louisiana.\nYazoo - The tribe lived on the Yazoo River to the northwest of the Choctaw. They spoke a language that was related to Tunica (Barnett 2012:77). Interestingly, in the 1700s, two Choctaw towns were named \"East Yazoo\" and \"West Yazoo.\" Their relationship to the Yazoo tribe is unknown. In 1730, the Yazoo attacked the French along with the Natchez. Afterwards, the Yazoo tribe was decimated by the Quapaw. Survivors were sold into slavery in distant places or may have joined the Choctaw and Chickasaw.\nChakchiuma - \"Chakchiuma\" comes from the Choctaw phrase \"Shakshi Homma,\" meaning \"Red Crawfish.\" The Chakchiuma are said to have broken off from the Choctaw, moved to present-day Arkansas, and then to have been forced back into present-day Mississippi between the Choctaw and Chickasaw. Reportedly the Chakchiuma began raiding both the Choctaw and Chickasaw. Finally, a Choctaw/Chickasaw coalition destroyed the Chakchiuma tribe, with survivors joining the Choctaw and Chickasaw. Several Choctaw chiefs, including Coleman Cole were Chakchiuma descendants (Cushman 1899).\nTaensa - In 1700s, the Taensa were living in present-day northeast Louisiana. Through the 1700s, they moved down the Mississippi River to near New Orleans, and then over to the Mobile, Alabama, area, where they presumably mixed with Choctawan people. In 1763, they moved to the Red River in Louisiana. Today, a formal Taensa tribe does not exist, but their descendants are among the Choctaw, Chitimacha, and Alabama tribes.\nQuapaw- The Quapaw are a Siouan tribe, closely related to the Osage, Kansa, and Omaha. In 1700, they were living at the junction of the Arkansas and the Mississippi River. At times, the Quapaw were Choctaw trading partners. At other times, Quapaws attacked Choctaw hunting parties for trespassing on their lands in Arkansas. Today, Quapaw Nation is located in northeastern Oklahoma.\nBarnett, James F. 2012.

The Raven had no warm place to land and play, so he asked the Sun to warm it up.\nThe Sun then rose upon the Land, and it warmed up, and the ice started to melt.\nUpon this land a great River formed, which thousands of years later would be known as the Yu-Kon. And on this River was the village in which people lived, and it was called Eee-man-ghuk.\nThe people were happy, and the River provided abundantly. But there was one taboo: that they could not go downriver. They could hunt, fish and play upriver, but downriver belonged to the Raven and no one could go there.\nAs things happen, there was a disagreement between two people, and the disagreement got worse, and the village divided. Those that were with one group lived on the Sunrise side, and those that agreed with the others lived on the Sunset side. And much hatred and enmity ensued between the two sides. Only the Shaman could speak to those on either side.\nTwo of the children, a boy named Pee-tuk, and a girl named Ma-tiq had been friends since childhood. They always played together, and were together all day. But when the families of the village split, they ended up on opposite sides. Still, their friendship persevered, and when Womanhood came to the girl and Manhood came to the boy, they were still friends and wanted to be together, but the village would not approve because they were from opposite sides.\n\u201cWhat is downriver?\u201d\ufffd, asked Ma-tiq.\nSo the lovers were very sad, and they tried to meet in secret now and then, but their hearts ached for each other, and one day their resolve steeled and they decided to take a boat and risk going downriver. One night, when the moon was setting, and the owls were singing, Ma-tiq and Pee-tuk met on the riverbank and took a small boat and paddled downriver.\nBut the Raven saw them, because the Eye of the Raven sees all. And the Raven was angry and jealous, and planned his revenge.\nMa-tiq and Pee-tuk paddled downstream, and the River got wider and bigger, and the water started to taste bitter, and they came upon the Big Water that the Shaman had spoken about. After they entered the Big Water, the Raven flapped his wings and a strong gale blew, and the boat was taken away from shore. The waves were big, and the little boat was so small. Ma-tiq and Pee-tuq were very afraid and they feared for their lives. Meantime, the Raven squawked overhead, in glee and joy.\nBut the Sun took pity on the lovers. He shone stronger and stronger for them, and the waves did calm down, and the wind died out. After many days adrift on the boat, the sea was calm, the Raven could not be seen, and the boat drifted. Ma-tiq and Pee-tuq were very hungry and thirsty, for the little they had packed had run out. They could not paddle, for they could not see land, and did not know where to go.\nBut one day, as they weakened, a land did appear, and they paddled towards it. And in time came to a shore of beautiful birds, furry animals, fruit trees of every kind, and clear, crystal streams of pure water. The Sun shone on them and blessed them with many children.\nAnd when Pee-tuk and Ma-tiq got old, and their children, grandchildren and great grandchildren gathered around them, the lovers would tell them that they came from the First People, and that they were from the village of Eee-man-ghuk, that the Sun blesses all and that the Raven now must eat what people throw away."

which can be terminated in 2024 - Cawston and fellow tribal leaders want to be formally represented in talks.\n\u201cWe have no representation even though our people have lived for thousands of years in this region,\u201d Cawston said, adding that the river\u2019s 15 U.S. tribes had seen their requests for formal representation at the negotiations rebuffed.\nThree Canadian tribes have also \u201crequested direct participation in the negotiations but to date have not reached agreement with Canada on that issue\u201d, said a spokeswoman for Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, chair of the Okanagan Nation Alliance.\nCanada meets with the three Canadian tribes before each round of talks and debriefs them afterwards, said a spokeswoman for the British Columbia Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum, which serves on the Canadian negotiating team.\nThe dams built along the Columbia River helped make Washington into a leader in apple production and were viewed as an important way to sustain agriculture in the area.\nApples are the state\u2019s top agricultural crop, representing some $2 billion to $2.5 billion in sales each year, according to the Washington Apple Commission.\nBut Cawston said the upstream movement of fish was blocked by two dams along the river, Chief Joseph and Grand Coulee, the latter of which folk singer Woody Guthrie called \u201cthe mightiest thing ever built by a man\u201d in his song \u201cRoll On, Columbia\u201d.\n\u201cSalmon was up to 70 percent of our diet,\u201d Cawston told the Thomson Reuters Foundation from the tribe\u2019s fish hatchery in the reservation, 128 miles (206km) northeast of Seattle.\nTo mitigate for the loss of endangered salmon along the Columbia, federal agencies maintain and fund fish hatcheries, restore habitat and cull invasive predators.\nFor example, one quarter of the reservoir of the Grand Coulee Dam has been set aside for local tribes to fish and hunt.\nAnd the tide is turning for fish losses this year thanks to favorable ocean conditions, with 1.3 million salmon and steelhead expected to enter the Columbia River in 2019 - according to the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife - compared to 665,000 in 2018.\nThe 1964 treaty sets a protocol for managing how much water Canada will release annually from the river\u2019s headwaters and how much the United States will pay in return.\nTribes hope the revised agreement will prioritize fishing by adding a third pillar alongside hydropower and flood control, the so-called \u201cecosystem-based function\u201d.\nThis would \u201cprovide the right quantity of water at the right time to help fish migration and improve river conditions,\u201d said Greg Haller, executive director of environmental group Pacific Rivers.\nHe cited the abnormally hot summer of 2015 when more than 250,000 Columbia River sockeye salmon died, an event scientists fear may become more common due to climate change.\nEnvironmentalists said there was a tradeoff in managing the river between interests like flood control and better conditions for fish, but argue they can coexist.\nDemand for hydropower has decreased in recent years as California, once its biggest customer, adopts more solar and wind power, according to the Bonneville Power Administration, the federal agency that administers Columbia River hydropower.\nA 2017 study by environmental consultancy Earth Economics estimated improved management of the Columbia River could produce economic gains of $1.5 billion annually.\nNeither the U.S. nor Canadian negotiating teams would comment on river management in the revised treaty with talks ongoing.\nDespite the lack of formal participation, Cawston remains cautiously optimistic he might one day experience what his forefathers did.\n\u201cWith the renegotiation of this treaty, I really look forward to seeing salmon passage behind Chief Joseph Dam and Grand Coulee Dam,\u201d he said."

                            "text": "The traditional owners of these lands in this area were the Taungurung people. They shared a common bond in moiety affiliation with other neighbouring tribes. Their world was divided into two moieties: Waang (crow) and Bunjil (wedge tail eagle). Members of the tribe identified with one or the other of these moieties and it was that which determined the pattern for marriage between individuals, clans and tribes and transcended local allegiances by obliging clan members to find spouses from some distant clan of the opposite moiety, either within or outside their own wurrung (language group). The Taungurung people consisted of nine clans. These included the Buthera Balug, located on the Goulburn, as far down as Yea and Seymour, the Look Willam Clan roamed the area on the Campaspe River, near Kilmore and Mitchellstown, the Nattarak Balug lived on the Coliban and upper Campaspe Rivers while the Nira Balug \u2018Cave People\u2019 bordered the Great Dividing Range near Kilmore, Broadford, Pyalong and westward towards Mt Macedon.\nAround Yea and Alexandra though, it was the people of the Warring-Illum Balug Clan (Warring being the name for the Goulburn River) and the Yarran-Illam located on the east side of the Goulburn River, below Seymour. The Yeerun-Illam-Balug inhabited the area around Benalla and the Yowung-Illam- Balug lived at Alexandra, Mansfield and the Upper Goulburn River.\nSadly there are descendants of only five of those clan groups that survive today. The nomadic nature of the Taungurung people enabled them to utilise the resources available in their vast country. They had an intimate knowledge of their environment and were able to sustain the ecology of the each region and exploit the food available.\nThe Taungurung people travelled south during the warmer months and north when the weather cooled.\nWhen the European explorers Hume & Hovell first crossed the River here in the wetlands on 4-5 December 1824 they named it Muddy Creek (later renamed the Yea River) the area was already occupied by Aboriginal people. Within 15 years of that crossing most of the land in the area had been taken up by graziers.\nFrom that time, life for the Taungurung people changed dramatically and was severely disrupted by the early establishment and expansion of European settlement. Their traditional society broke down and soon after, Aboriginal mortality rates soared as a result of introduced diseases, denial of access to traditional foods and medicines and conflict.\nAt various times, Aboriginal settlements were established in the area by missionaries and governments at Michellstown, Acheron and Coranderrk (Healesville) however despite relative success were eventually dissolved. The Taungurung and other members of Kulin Nation were deeply impacted by the dictates of the various government assimilation and integration policies.\nToday, the descendants of the Taungurung form a strong and vibrant community. Descendants of five of the original clan groups meet regularly at Camp Jungai\u2014an ancestral ceremonial site. Elders assist with the instruction of younger generations in culture, history, and language and furthering of their knowledge and appreciation of their heritage as the rightful custodians of the Taungurung lands in Central Victoria."

There was always music playing and you can image that all types of people were playing all kinds of music. It extended my knowledge of music. As much as it was a challenge, I turned it into a positive.\"\nZameka said she always loved singing but had to put her dreams on the back burner while she was at school because her parents were not convinced it was more than a hobby.\n\"I guess this is a career I grew to discover. My parents always felt it was a hobby rather than a career. So they would always tell me to stick to my studies. I studied marketing at UNISA and tried music at the same time. When I was done with my qualification, I showed my parents what I had achieved and then threw myself into music full-time.\"\nShe rose to fame as the voice behind Prince Kaybee's hit Story Teller on the DJ's debut album.\n\"Prince Kaybee taught me to persist and have courage to follow your dreams.

God had allowed this, because the Isrealites had not been faithful to Him and had (once again) turned away from the Lord and worshiped false gods.\nBut, God is merciful and He did not let His punishment go on forever. That\u2019s where Gideon comes in\u2013God is going to use him to deliver the Israelites from the grip of the Medianites.\nNeither does sneaking out in the middle of the night to tear down the altar of Baal and the Asherah pole, because he was too scared to do it during the day (See Judges 6:25-27). Nope, definitely not mighty warrior stuff, in my opinion.\nAnd, what about the whole fleece thing? Gideon\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, Lord, before I do that for you, I\u2019m gonna need You to prove what You\u2019re saying\u2013not once, but twice.\u201d (See Judges 6:33-40) Kinda wimpy.\nBesides seeing that my own wimpy behavior is not at all unique, this is the part that encourages me greatly-God saw what He would help Gideon become way before Gideon was that in reality. God saw, not what Gideon was at the moment, but who God Himself would shape Gideon to be.\nThat must mean that God could do the same thing for me, right? That even though I mess up constantly and am very much a work in progress, God calls me by the name of who He is shaping me to become.\nWhat, then, does that mean for me and for you?\nNow, I\u2019ve never heard Him speak to me audibly like Gideon, so I don\u2019t know if I have a name specific just for me and I can\u2019t begin to fathom what that might be, but I know some names He has called me.\nGideon couldn\u2019t have become the Mighty Warrior God saw in him without God shaping him into it. In the same way, I would not be able to be the things God calls me without His amazing grace and mercy in my own life. I am so amazed that God looks at this person I am, who I feel is so inadequate, and sees what He would have me become. Could I be a Mighty Warrior? A Great Encourager? Or, maybe, a Powerful Victor?\nI don\u2019t know what my specific calling is, but I do know that my ever faithful God will shape me, just as he did Gideon. And, I can stand with power and obey my God in whatever great plan He has for my life, because He has called me by name and will be faithful to make His Words come to pass.\nHe made Gideon into that Mighty Warrior. What will He shape me into?\nMy precious Lord, I am humbled that You called me at all\u2013let alone that You have called me such wonderful things. Help me to see myself the way You see me, so nothing will stand in the way of me accomplishing Your plan in my life. Help me to hear the name You call me by and please shape me to become nothing less than who You say I am. Amen."

Sleepers should get the softness and cloud-like feel, without the drowning feeling.\nThe other benefit of such a soft surface is the lack of horizontal movement. Sleepers should can toss and turn without waking their partner. The negative of such a soft top is the lack of response. It requires more energy to move around on the iKrema Mattress.\nThe Ikrema\u2019s top layer is a cool memory foam designed to wick heat away from the sleepers. They also have a breathable top fabric to aid in cooling.

                            "text": "While we sleep, our bodies move into and out of many different positions. But who knows how long it stays that way?.. Until you wake up and something hurts.. like your neck or back.\nHere are 5 quick and easy stretches to start off the morning BEFORE you get out of bed.\nBelow you can watch a quick video of me performing each stretch. Hold each stretch for 8 to 10 breaths. In the video I just went quickly through each stretch.\nAlso, read detailed descriptions below the video on how to perform each stretch.\n1. \u201cGood Morning\u201d \u2013 Lying on your back, reach your arms up over your head, arch your back as it lifts away from the sheets, lengthen your legs and take 2 nice, long, deep breaths in\u2026 and out. This stretch is used to wake up your body, lengthen your spine, and lets your body know you are getting ready to move.\n2. \u201cKnee-d a Hug\u201d \u2013 Lying on your back, draw your knees up toward your chest, wrap your arms around the top or behind your knees and give them a hug.. relax your neck and shoulders. Slowly and gently, rock from side to side. Press your lower back into the mattress and take 5 slow, deep breaths, in\u2026 and out. This stretch is great for releasing tightness in the lower back.\n3. \u201cSupine Spinal Twist\u201d \u2013 Lying on your back with legs extended, draw your right knee up toward the chest and hug it in. Use your left hand to help guide your bent right leg across the left side of the body and let the knee relax down. Open the right arm and turn your head to the right, and take 5 slow, deep breaths in\u2026 and out. Repeat for the left side. These stretches feel amazing to the hips, lower back, and chest even!\n4. \u201cHamstring Stretch\u201d \u2013 Lying on your back with legs extended, draw your right knee up toward the chest. Wrap both hands around the back of the leg (either above or below the knee) and extend the right foot up toward the ceiling. Pull the leg closer to the chest, and begin to rotate the ankle around in big, slow circles. Taking 5 long, slow, deep breaths.. ease deeper into the stretch. Repeat for the left side. These stretches are important to help loosen up your lower back, hamstrings, hips, knees, and ankles.\n5. \u201cNice Neck\u201d \u2013 Follow this sequence in a slow, smooth fashion to avoid any injury. First, sit up tall with your legs draped over the side of your bed, and sit on your hands. Then, tuck your chin to your chest and slowly look down, extending one cervical vertebrae at a time. Slowly lift the head back up. Next, lift the chin as you look up to the ceiling, but do NOT let your head fall all the way back. Second, turn your head and look toward the right, aiming to peer behind the right shoulder. Take 5 deep breaths here, and slowly repeat to the left side. These neck stretches will help to relieve the pain from sleeping on pillows either too big or too small.. and will start to improve your range of motion in the cervical spine.\nPlease, try these stretches to best of your ability, and if you feel any sharp pain.. you may have gone too far. Let your breathing be your guide, and take it slow! The rest of your day may be filled with the rush, so take this time for YOU. And if it is your first time stretching before you get out of bed, let me know how you feel afterward!"

                            "text": "He turned slowly back to the room. A duvet wrinkled, the threads rubbing together. Jimmy rubbed his hands together similarly. The look of terror and desperation cracked apart between a wide smile. His face remained flush. Jimmy knew the blood was gushing somewhere else. The underwear slid down his sheened legs. Connie, her naked flesh glistening in the glow of the ancient lights.\nJimmy smiled wryly, slinking back into the bed. She moved her hands under the covers, making sure that he was ready to carry on. As her hand touched him, his smile opened. He was ready, and in a few brief, intense minutes the passion was out of them both as they sunk again into the mattress. The pocketed springs gave a last, long groan, and the couple finally fell into a happy, relieved slumber.\nIt was but a brief respite. Outside, the hazy sky filled with thunder and a storm buffeted the construction of the house. The spittle of rain on the clouded-up bedroom window became steadily more intense, more regular.\nIt also hid the sound of the lock clicking, padded footsteps pacing in through the bedroom door and the steady scrape of sharpened metal on the treads of the staircase.\nIn quick succession: THWACK! THWACK! THWACK!\nConnie quickly gasped. She shuddered, suddenly feeling a chill. Her eyes opened, and she saw the rain on the window. The frame was rattling in the wind. She took a breath, beginning to sit up. Rubbing her eyes, her ears now focused on the sound outside the door.\nHe murmured again, and sleepily gestured her away. As if to say not right now.\n\u201cYes, now!\u201d she hissed, her foot finding his leg. He shook, then got up out of bed. He found the door handle in the darkness. The handle rattled but didn\u2019t move. There was an electrical buzzing and, as he noticed the lights in the room had extinguished, his head turned.\nBefore Connie could answer, the bedroom door seemed to fall open by itself. Jimmy\u2019s head turned, and, with a grunt of surprise, he saw Mrs. Chaldean, standing in the doorway.\nConnie laughed as Jimmy retrieved his clothes from the heap on the floor. He stood up, just as a muffled but distinct voice came through the door.\nJimmy didn\u2019t answer. He stared at Connie. His eyes returned to Mrs. Chaldean. In the gloom b y her legs, a black plastic sack, like those used for rubbish, flapped and crackled. Their gaze met. Jimmy said nothing about the sack.\nSome low, light thuds echoed through the building as Mrs. Chaldean climbed the stairwell to the third floor, where her quarters were. Jimmy, breathless, looked to Connie. He climbed back into the bed.\n\u201cWe\u2019re out of here by eight tomorrow, alright?\u201d He growled. His eyes rolled to upstairs, as he heard a wheeze of a mattress, much quieter than the racket that Jimmy and Connie had connived to bring about. Then silence.\nJimmy gave a sceptical glance to the room, as if he could see something in the darkness, but shook his head. He felt drowsy and the pillows on the bed next to Connie looked much more inviting now.\nFinally, it seemed that the ghosts that lurked the corridors of Holman Hall would let their guests slumber. Jimmy slipped into the bed. The sheets crinkled. He felt Connie\u2019s warmth close by, and a hand wandered from his side toward hers, tenting the linen subtly, then meeting the taut flesh. She hummed, and he hummed too, taking a deep breath of her essence.\nEyes closed, Jimmy smiled, and his tented hands fell flat on Connie\u2019s thigh, and wandered further in a well-rehearsed dance of the five fingers. He took another deep breath, about to make the final flourish of his act, but the breath stirred him in a way he didn\u2019t expect. In the dark his eyes screwed up and his naked shoulders rolled restlessly. He withdrew, feeling a tingling sensation in the back of his mind. Somehow, his eyes open now and glistening, he felt he was being observed by a force of powers unimaginable.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Connie murmured, feeling the disturbance in the bed and the removal of Jimmy\u2019s hand.\nHe waved, making a noncommittal noise, and let the drowsiness descend onto his dewy eyes, and fell into a perturbed, slumber, his arms like those of plastic figurines, cast closely to his self. They stayed there, stiff and immobile, all night.\nA cold draft rattled the loose window frame again. It roused Connie. She\u2019d been awake for a good while already but maintaining the pretence of sleep with closed eyes. Maybe this strange house would melt into her familiar surroundings if she wished it hard enough?\nShe opened her eyes after the rattling carried across the room. She took a shallow breath. Cold stale air. Connie sat up, and the chill caught her skin, bringing out goosepimples on her naked breasts as the duvet fell with the same raspy sound that had kept her awake with every subconscious movement.\nNext to her, Jimmy murmured incomprehensibly as he stirred, his eyes opening slowly. He smiled, seeing her sitting in bed, gazing sleepily across the top of her goose pimpled frontage.\nBefore she could reply, there was a clatter outside and the door to the room flung open. Quickly, Connie wrenched the cover up. Mrs Chaldean leant in.\n\u201cSix-thirty, loves. About time you young things were up and out of that bed, I should think!\u201d Mrs. Chaldean trilled, drawing the door closed with a muffled thump.\nConnie threw the bedcovers off, despite the coldness that brought up her skin like a Christmas turkey. She looked out of the window, seeing sunshine in the sky but not feeling any of its warmth. Turning back, she saw Jimmy propped up in the bed.\nJimmy finished dressing by pulling on a cardigan from the bottom of his backpack over his shoulders and opened the door. \u201cLadies first,\u201d he said playfully. Connie, despite her scorn, couldn\u2019t fail to smile, just a tiny bit.\nThe dining room looked brighter than it did the night before, and as the couple trooped down the staircase, the sound of clattering cutlery against porcelain grew steadily louder, and the warm scent of a cooked breakfast wafted, meeting Jimmy and Connie midway down. They paused for a moment, savouring it.\nJimmy did so, but Connie paused for a moment. Her eyes were drawn to the locked door of the reception room. In the morning sun the hallway was full of motes of hanging dust, disturbed only by the passage of the two guests toward the dining room. Her gaze on the door was broken only by the rattling of the dining room handle under Jimmy\u2019s hands. Shaking her head, she followed.\n\u201cTwo, what do you\u2026\u201d he began to protest, but felt a pain bolting across his shin. He corrected course quickly, for the second time in as many minutes.\n\u201cYes, lets,\u201d the landlady replied with a sigh. The conversation petered out, replaced with the sounds of breakfast being eaten.\nAs they ate, Mrs. Chaldean excused herself. The kitchen door clattered closed. Pulling back her shawl, she checked the watch on her withered wrist. Wordlessly she acknowledged the tiny movement, then made a tiny movement herself, gliding across to the sideboard by the door. The register opened under the lightest of touches, the pages flittering past, propelled by a mystical kind of hurry.\n\u201cLet\u2019s change that, shall we?\u201d Mrs. Chaldean hummed to herself. \u201cPut that right.\u201d She crossed the latest two entries in the register."

                            "text": "This is the big moment! It is a good idea to take a small carton with you to the kennels, in which to bring your precious puppy home. If the weather is cold, line the carton thickly with folded newspaper, but be sure to leave air holes at the top. Over this lining, put a lot of torn-up shreds of newspaper. Carry the puppy in this box, whether you take him home by car, bus, train, or subway. He may get scared and become carsick, and it will be much easier to clean the box than to clean your clothes!\nOf course you will have a bed all ready for your pup when you bring him home. This can be an old wooden chair with a back and the legs sawed off to about three inches from the floor, or a shiny new dog bed right from a store. Or it can be a bed you\u2019ve made yourself from a box or crate, with three high sides, an open front, and, if you can manage it, small legs to keep it off the drafty floor.\nIts mattress can be one you bought at a pet shop, or a scrap of clean old rug folded over several times, or a lot of shredded newspaper. It had better be something that the pup can\u2019t chew up too easily. A burlap sack filled with cedar shavings will discourage fleas and keep your dog smelling as fresh as a newly sharpened pencil. Any mattress or blanket for a dog should be aired at least once a week. And don\u2019t think a mattress will make a \u201csofty\u201d of your petl The reason for a mattress is to keep him from catching cold and to prevent the hair from being worn off the back of his legs. Both can happen if he sleeps on bare wood.\nOnce you have a bed and mattress, you must then decide where to put them. Even if you live in the country and get a dog of a large breed that will eventually stay outdoors in his own doghouse, the chances are that he will sleep in your house while he is still a small puppy. So be sure to put his bed in a place that is out of drafts. NOT in the basement; NOT at the top of a flight of stairs; and NOT right next to a hot radiator. If your kitchen is large enough, a corner there is a good place. Be sure there is no rat or roach poison anywhere in the house where the puppy can get at it, unless you are positive it is a kind that won\u2019t harm animals. And also be sure the pup can\u2019t get into the garbage pail or any place where food is kept.\nIf it is possible to fence off a small space in one room, where your pup can run and have his bed and drinkingwater bowl, this will save much wear and tear on the rest of the house. At least until the pup is housebroken!\nWell, let\u2019s say you have his bed in the kitchen, with a bowl of fresh water near. Next spread newspapers over the floor as the pup\u2019s temporary toilet . . . more about this in the Housebreaking Section. And here you come through the door, carton in arms, to introduce your puppy to his new home!\nNow, you must remember that this new member of your family will be frightened and bewildered by his strange surroundings. So take him out of the box very gently. NOT by the nape of the neck, like a kitten. And NOT by his two front legs. The correct way to pick up a puppy is to put one hand under his chest and front legs, the other between his hind legs and under his belly. Then let him rest on one forearm against your body, so he won\u2019t fall. Keep a firm hold on him in case he wriggles.\nPlace him on his bed. Let him get up and wander around his corner, sniffing at the newspapers. Make him stay on them until he urinates. Then you can let him examine the rest of the house, but keep a sharp eye out to see he doesn\u2019t get into mischief. He is still too young to know what is right and proper.\nDon\u2019t pick him up or pet him much just yet. Don\u2019t let your family or friends crowd around him making a lot of loud noises. Watch the puppy carefully, talking to him in a low voice to tell him everything is all right. Give him a toy, such as an old rag knotted together or a hard rubber bone, and let him play a while. Then give him a drink of water and some of the food he had been used to eating at the kennels. If he curls up on his bed and goes to sleep, leave him alone. This is a good sign that he is getting used to his new home.\nBut no matter how thoughtful you have been, nor what you have done to make him comfortable, you can be pretty sure that your puppy will be miserable on his first night in his new home. And he will let you know itl He will whine, cry, and maybe even howl, because he is homesick. After all, this is the first time he\u2019s ever been away from his mother and his brothers and sisters. The world will seem like a terribly big, dark, and lonely place. If you have ever been homesick, you will know exactly how a puppy feels.\nTake an old-fashioned earthenware jug and fill it with hot water. Cork it tightly and wrap it carefully in an old bath towel. Put this in a corner of the puppy\u2019s bed. He will curl up next to it, as if it were his mother\u2019s warm body. If you haven\u2019t such a jug, a warm brick is good. But a regular hot-water bottle is dangerous, as he may chew right through the rubber and get burned by the hot water.\nThen take an alarm clock and put it under the blanket or mattress. Its ticking will sound like the beating hearts of his brothers and sisters.\nBut if he cries in spite of these comforts, let him sleep in your room (out of drafts) for one or two nights only. After that, he should be so used to his own bed that he will go quietly to sleep there. If he doesn\u2019t, you\u2019ll have to be firm and let him howl until he gets tired. Your family may complain, but you can assure them the temporary noise is worth putting up with in order to have a welltrained dog.\nWhen you read these next pages, you may suspect that you\u2019re going to be awfully busy with this wetting, chewing, hungry little animal that you\u2019ve brought into your house. Well, the truth is that until he\u2019s full-grown, you will be. But this busyness will also be fun, if you take the problems one by one. Don\u2019t try to learn to do everything at once.\nMost important, don\u2019t become frightened or nervous if you should forget to do a few of the things suggested here. Raising a dog should be a pleasure, not a burden. Your puppy is healthy, and he\u2019s very happy with you. If you skip one of his meals, or forget to give him a dose of cod-liver oil, don\u2019t worry too much. He may be a little hungry, but he won\u2019t get sick. However, don\u2019t make a practice over a long period of time of forgetting too many things, or your pup will not grow up to be the strong dog you want him to be.\nOne person in the family should do the teaching, so Beans doesn\u2019t get confused. Since he\u2019s your dog, that person should be you. Don\u2019t let everyone start to scream \u201cBeansl\u201d at the poor pup. Instead, you pet him, saying \u201cGood little Beans\u201d as you do so. Call \u201cHere, Beansl Here, Beansl\u201d when you feed him his dinner. Give him one end of a toy to pull while you pull the other, saying \u201cThat\u2019s it, Beans! Pull, Beansl\u201d The trick is to say his name every time you do anything with or for your pup. Take a bit of biscuit in your hand and hold it out, calling \u201cBeans!\u201d at the same time. When he comes to you, give him this biscuit right away as a reward. Make a fuss over him. Call him by his name every time you praise him, or every time you have to scold him. But don\u2019t yell. A dog\u2019s hearing is much sharper than ours. A loud voice only frightens a puppy. He will get the idea that you are either praising or scolding him from the tone of your voice, not from how loud it is. This is an important thing to remember for all future training."

I had been sixteen on The Day, and my family had taken vacations, so I remember hotels. This one was five stories tall and relatively well-preserved. The fires had spared it, and although the lobby was open to the elements the rest of the building was undamaged, pristine.\n\"Holiday Inn, maybe. Maybe a Days Inn? I don't recognize the color scheme.\"\n\"A hotel. People from out of town would pay money for a safe place to sleep.\"\nShe wore the face that said, you are making very little sense right now, but I will let it go because you are older and know things. All she actually voiced was, \"Oh.\" It was quickly followed by, \"Will there be food?\"\nWe found the kitchen, but the pantry had been thoroughly looted long ago. There were a few items that no one in the early days would have bothered with: spices and other non-perishables. I gathered some of them into a like-new saucepan complete with lid, and slid it into my pack. She looked impatiently at me. \"Old Bay. You'll like it, trust me, next time we catch a fish.\"\nWe made our way back out to the lobby and I went behind the front desk. If the hotel had used door cards they wouldn't work without power but... there: the key cabinet, and there were plenty still there. \"You still have the sack? The big one?\"\n\"Blankets. Sheets. Pillows. We'll check the linen room but we may have to go room to room.\"\n\"Oh. Oh... there's beds.\" Now she understood what the building was.\n\"Show me!\" She was excited, wide-eyed. In the village, there were only three beds: the Mayor's; the Mayor's son's; and the infirmary bed, which was occupied either by the Doc, late-term pregnant women, or the very ill.\nThe first room for which he had a key was 127. He handed her the shotgun and took the fireman's axe from across his back. Holding it in his right hand, he used his left to quietly slide the key into the lock and turn the knob.\nThe room was clear, clean, frozen. It was a time capsule. The beds were made and the sheets turned down, the gossamer-thin white curtains were closed but the blackout curtains were open enough to let light spill across the room. There was no dust. The bathroom was equally immaculate, with tiny soaps wrapped in paper, small drinking glasses wrapped in plastic.\nHe gently closed the door behind them. She stood halfway into the room, waiting. \"Well, go ahead,\" he said.\nShe grinned, laid the shotgun carefully on the desk beside the little card detailing what the television channels would have been, and then moved to the foot of the nearest bed.\nHe started to answer, caught himself, and then chuckled. \"No reason. It's just what people used to do. Keeps dirt from your shoes off the bed.\" Her boots were filthy, but there would be no maid coming tomorrow to clean the room and think them slobs.\n\"Oh.\" She was used to doing as she was told \u2014 it had kept her alive more than once \u2014 and she did so now.\nHe moved to the curtains, checked outside: the room faced the pool area, which was clear of zombies. At least two exit points. Safe enough. They could stay here a while, if they needed to. He pulled the chord, closed the blackout curtains almost completely, and when he turned back, she was sitting at the foot of the far bed, pushing her hands down into the softness of the comforter. \"It's wonderful.\"\nHe smiled. \"I'll bet.\" He dropped his pack into the armchair by the window, and climbed onto the other bed, kicking off his shoes as he went. The bed seemed to envelop him as his weight settled onto it; gather him up, cradle him. He closed his eyes, but only for a moment.\nWhen he opened them again the room was dark. She was in his bed, next to him. As soon as he stirred, she whispered. \"Why haven't you ever tried to have me?\"\nHis mind was foggy. \"How long did I sleep?\"\n\"It's dark, so, a while. Why not?\"\nHe swung his legs off the bed, went to the window, peered out; still clear, still safe. He opened the blackout curtains a bit more, to let light into the room. \"I'm sorry I fell asleep. That was stupid of me.\"\n\"It's fine. Why not?\" She hadn't moved from his bed, her head propped up on one hand, staring at him, the moonlight flickering in her eyes. \"I know you want to. So why?\"\nShe snorted. \"I'm the oldest with no babies. The younger men won't touch me because they think I'm yours.\"\nHe answered instinctively, \"You don't belong to me; you don't belong to anyone: you belong to yourself. Don't ever\u2014\" It was all too strident. She never took too well to that. \"Listen, you don't owe me. I saved you because it was the right thing to do. I've kept you with me because, I don't know, that was right, too. You don't understand: people used to look out for each other. At least, sometimes. Especially kids, even other people's kids. You were just a kid.\"\nHe couldn't think of anything to say. He sat down, with his back to her. She was in his ear, whispering again: \"You're smart, and careful, and deadly. You've taught me to be the same. Let's have smart, careful, deadly children and one of them can be Mayor.\""

Try these 24 tips for lifestyle relief.\nDo you have aching, creeping, crawling, or prickling sensations in your legs when you lie down or sit still? Those are the classic symptoms of a common disorder called restless legs syndrome.\nAn estimated 5% to 15% of adults have restless legs syndrome (RLS), and up to 19% of pregnant women develop RLS symptoms during pregnancy. Restless legs syndrome does not cause serious health problems, but can interfere with sleep and lead to severe fatigue. Here are tips for a symptom-free lifestyle.\nGet moving at lunchtime: Take your sandwich with you for a walk to the park or around the block.\nGive your circulation -- and you -- an afternoon boost; jog in place for a few minutes.\nWork out the kinks at work: Take a 5-minute break every hour -- get up, stretch, walk around.\nDo your body a favor and ease RLS symptoms -- start and end your day by stretching your legs.\nRoad trip? Whether passenger or driver, stay alert and loose. Stop often for a good stretch.\nEase mind and body -- and restless legs -- with a gentle leg massage.\nJetting off on a business trip? Request an aisle seat when you fly. Then give your circulation a boost by getting up frequently.\nGot the 3 o'clock slump? Skip the coffee, get up and do leg stretches for 5 minutes.\nOn a conference call? Watching TV? Use that time to give your legs a gentle massage.\nUnwind with a hot bath. It relaxes body and soul -- and for some it soothes RLS symptoms, too.\nChill out: Ice packs may calm those restless legs.\nAre you getting enough iron? Iron deficiency is one cause of RLS. Talk to your doctor.\nBottoms up? Go easy on the alcohol. It can make RLS symptoms worse.\nEase symptoms -- and get a better night's sleep -- avoid heavy meals close to bedtime.\nRelaxation techniques, such as meditation or progressive muscle relaxation, may reduce RLS symptoms.\nCertain drugs can cause RLS. Take medications, including herbal remedies, only as directed by your doctor.\nRegular, moderate exercise may help you sleep better. Take a walk with the kids, the dog, or a friend.\nWarm up to bedtime. A heating pad may soothe away symptoms of restless legs.\nTake it easy! Moderate workouts can relieve RLS symptoms, but excessive exercise may cause them to spike.\nSleep a little better tonight by avoiding nicotine and caffeine close to bedtime.\nYou'll sleep better, and feel better, if you maintain a regular sleep schedule.\nGet a better night's sleep; avoid alcohol close to bedtime.\nAvoid napping during the day for better sleep at night.\nCount sheep, daydream, or just close your eyes -- but whatever you do, try not to make bedtime worry time.\nSOURCES: EmedicineHealth: Restless Legs Syndrome -- Self Care at Home.

Then I snooze (and snooze and snooze\u2026) until 8:30 am Monday, Wednesday and Friday. On the weekends, I\u2019ll log an easy 12 hours per night on my pillow.\nA lot of mornings, I wake up, crawl to my kitchen, pour a mugful of coffee, then crawl back into bed with my laptop for two to three hours of work before finally getting out of bed to wash my face and make some eggs.\nTrust me, I\u2019ve tried to revamp my morning circus routine. But snoozing is sort of a hobby of mine and my past attempts have pretty much failed.\nSo when my editor asked me to try wake up at the exact same time every morning for two weeks, I took it as an opportunity to revamp my mornings... could this time be for good?\nI\u2019m lucky that I don\u2019t have any responsibilities that actually necessitate my waking before the sun rises, like a baby, early-starting office job, cat or partner. But I wanted the experiment to jump-start a lifestyle change, so I talked with a sleep specialist first.\nAccording to Chris Winter, M.D., medical director of the Sleep Medicine Center at Martha Jefferson Hospital in Virginia [in the US] and author of The Sleep Solution, it didn\u2019t matter what time I decided to wake up every morning, as long as it was consistent and allowed me to get a full night's rest. So I settled on a 7:20 am wake up time. That would give me enough time to take an 8 am yoga class on Tuesday and Thursday (an hour later than my usual go-to), while getting me up slightly earlier the other weekdays.\n\"It didn\u2019t matter what time I decided to wake up every morning as long as it was consistent\"\nI asked Winter for some tips for easy wakeups and how to stop hitting snooze. He recommended a regular bedtime and suggested that I try some meditation or movement in the morning. So I made a few rules to make it easier.\nFirst, I would get to bed earlier. It sounds pretty simple, but if you want to wake up at a set time, you have to go to bed at a set time, too, Winter explained. I typically aim to get seven to eight hours of sleep per night, so I aimed for an 11:30 to midnight bedtime.\nNext, I would need to follow a morning routine that\u2019d keep me out of bed after the alarm went off. That meant that I needed to ditch the in-bed article-writing, Insta-scrolling, email-answering, and phone-talking. My new morning routine, set forth by Winter, included exercising within an hour of waking. Not only did Winter suggest it, but some research suggests it could also help guide me toward a more balanced, active day.\nFor example, one study published in Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise found that women\u2019s brains reacted less strongly to photos of food (suggesting it was less tempting) following a morning sweat sesh. Plus, they were more active throughout the rest of the day. While I already typically log two-to-three hours of exercise per day, I figured morning movement couldn't hurt.\nWith a plan set in stone, I was ready to kick my routine into gear.\nOn the first day, I set multiple alarms. At 6:50 am, the first alarm went off and, knowing that I still had 30 minutes of earned rest, I fell back into a deep sleep\u2026 until 7:00 am when the buzzer went off. And so on and so forth... until 7:20 am rolled around and it was time to get out of bed and into some yoga gear. I had to get moving if I wanted to make my 8:00 am vinyasa flow.\nBy 9:30, I had completed my first workout, showered, had an on-the-go breakfast burrito and was stationed at the coffee shop around the corner from both my apartment and yoga studio ready to get down to work. I would rate my Monday morning a solid 8/10 on the wellness guru scale.\nMajor bonus: I didn\u2019t find myself fading mid-day the way I guessed I might \u2013 and my 7:00 pm workout was strong. So I went to bed pretty confident I\u2019d be able to repeat the results on Tuesday.\nI hopped out of bed at 7:20 am because I had to pee. But the walk to and from the bathroom made my feet cold, which felt like a valid excuse to climb back between the sheets. Half an hour later, my \u201cjust in case you were a knucklehead and didn\u2019t wake up\u201d alarm went off. It was a little rattling, but a quick shower and spoonful-of-peanut-butter breakfast meant that I was back at my go-to java-shop by 8:30 am, even earlier than the day before.\nAt 4:00 pm, I felt myself fading, but a cup of matcha helped me power through a two-hour weightlifting session. Sleeping in too late to flow in the am was a botch, but I got in a solid sweat in the pm so I\u2019d still rank the day a solid 7/10. But because I hit it (or should I say \u201cHIIT\u201d it) so hard in the gym that evening, when I got home I conked out by 10:30 pm. So much for a midnight bedtime.\nAfter getting nearly nine hours of sleep, waking up was a breeze. I heard my alarm, jumped out of bed and got to yoga with enough time to foam roll before class started. I had high energy levels for the rest of the day, only needing one cup of coffee, crushing my Crossfit WOD and generally feeling like an A+ early bird.\n\"I heard my alarm, jumped out of bed and got to yoga with enough time to foam roll before class\"\nThere was a company-wide meeting at 8:30 am, which meant I needed to be walking to the subway by the time my alarm would usually go off. I was up at 6:45 am and by 7:20 am, I was showered, fed and had even made my bed. Because the goal of this experiment was to wake up at the same time every morning, not to become a morning person, I felt like I had cheated. But, hey, work called.\nAfter a 10-hour work day, by the time I got to the gym, I felt like a zombie and basically slept walked my way through the workout. But instead of going home for a calm evening of chamomile tea and romcoms, I got a second wind and went out to dinner with my CrossFit friends. But I didn\u2019t get home until 11:45 pm. While I was in bed by midnight, it took my body another half hour to wind down from the day.\nI usually sleep in on Fridays, but not today. Today, I actually had a morning deadline, so I knew I had to wake up with my alarm or risk missing a deadline. Crisis averted.\nAfter a choppy and un-athletic five-minute yoga flow, I packed my bag and hit the coffee shop to get to work. Today was the first day I didn\u2019t make or buy a protein-packed breakfast, so by 1:00 pm, I was starving. But I blame that on my skipped-breakfast, not my wake-up time. On the bright side, my late lunch meant I was well-fuelled for my workout. I conked out within minutes of hitting the pillow that night and was asleep by 11:30 pm.\nI woke to my alarm at 7:20 am, but happily snoozed until 10:00\u2014the absolute latest I could snooze and still make it to CrossFit. I felt delightfully well rested, but by the time I geared-up for the gym, I knew I\u2019d need to take an Uber to the box on time.\nI\u2019d rank my first Saturday of this experiment as a total fail: I overslept by almost three hours and had to pay to get to my workout on time.\nBefore falling asleep on Saturday, I moved my alarm clock across the room. Which meant that I\u2019d physically have to get out of bed to turn off the tunes.\nWhen 7:20 came around on Sunday morning, I learned that this simple trick was also an effective one. After getting up to turn it off, I was up. I poured myself a cup of coffee, set up shop and was replying to emails by 7:30 am.\nBy the time I got to CrossFit at 11:00 am, I had responded to 10-plus emails and drafted an article. Total weekend win.\n\"By the time I got to CrossFit at 11:00 am, I had responded to emails and drafted an article\"\nBy the end of my first week, I felt exactly the same. I appreciated the extra hour or so I had to respond to emails on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, but I had to switch which yoga class I went to on Tuesday and Thursday and sorely missed my usual instructor. Plus, because I\u2019d cheated the experiment and slept until 10 on Saturday, I was still able to log 12 hours of sleep one night of the weekend.\nI hopped back on the phone with Winter. Because I mentioned it was easier waking up when I had yoga to look forward to, he suggested that I find a yoga flow I can follow along with from my apartment when I didn\u2019t have a studio class scheduled.\nHe also suggested that I try sleeping with the blinds open to see if the natural light would help me rise. \u201cThe goal is to help get your body into a routine, one sleep-in day doesn\u2019t make or break the experiment, nor will it get in the way of you reaping the benefits of mostly waking up at the same time,\u201d Winter added.\nGoing into the second week, my goal to try to kick things up a notch with his advice.\nThe night before, I only closed my blinds part way (instead of shutting them altogether) so that the light could help wake me up in the morning, as Winter suggested. I\u2019m on the second floor, so you can still sort of see into my room from the pavement, so I was hesitant about turning my room into a peek-a-boo adventure in the name of my experiment. Half-way open felt like a good compromise.\nWinter was right, I actually woke up naturally at 7:15 am. to the sunlight.\nI downloaded Sleep Cycle, a sleep app that works by monitoring your sleep and waking you up during the lightest phase of your sleep within a time frame that you get to set. My physical therapist Grayson Wickham, D.P.T., C.S.C.S., founder of Movement Vault, recommends that app for all his athletes, so I decided to give it a whirl.\nWaking up with the app was definitely easier, though it had me up 10 minutes before I really had to be up. If I hadn\u2019t checked my email and seen a few high-priority messages, I would have taken some self-discipline not to hit snooze and get in at least another 10 minutes.\nOn Day 10, I snoozed until 10:30 am. I know, I know. I should have had more self control than to sleep in for two and half hours. But when I woke up at 7:20, I had a fever and felt like garbage. And while I still had work to do, I ordered a bagel and coffee via delivery and spent the next six hours in my pyjamas, writing from bed.\nBy 5:00 pm, I finished my \u201cmust-do today\u201d list, and took a soul-soothing, window-fogging steamy shower until I felt like my sinuses would be clear for the next two years. After, I felt much better and hopped on a stationary bike to sweat out some of the nastiness I was feeling. I was back home and eating chicken soup in bed by 9:00 pm. and asleep by 11:00 pm.\nDays 11 and 12, I woke up at 7:20 am and still felt sick. But I had work to do. So I got up, did a quick stretch routine and got the day started. By mid-day, my energy was dragging\u2026 so I napped\u2026 for two hours both days. I felt guilty for logging those extra hours, but Winter assured me that it\u2019s actually okay to nap because I was still getting my body into the routine of waking up at the same time in the am. Plus, my body was working to fight off infection.\nThe last two days of my experiment fell at the weekend, and truthfully, I wanted nothing more than to cut the whole thing short and sleep in past noon.\nMy last two weeks of CrossFit training had been particularly draining and while I diligently got to sleep by 11:30 pm both nights, eight hours of sleep just didn\u2019t feel like enough.\nWinter assured me that it\u2019s actually very common for athletes to require more sleep than the average exerciser, and while I\u2019m no CrossFit Games athlete, because I work out two hours per day, Winter said that I probably do need more than the eight hours of sleep per night.\n\"Because I work out two hours per day, I probably need more than the eight hours sleep\"\nThe takeaway? Although waking up at the random time of 7:20 am didn\u2019t drastically change my life (and, at times, it was actually pretty tough), I really enjoyed getting my work started so early each morning and it definitely made me feel more productive.\nIf I had to do it again, I\u2019d aim for an earlier 10:30 pm bedtime. And, honestly, I think that I will. Going forward, I want to stick with a relatively set sleep schedule and I have resolved to leave my snooze-button habit in the past.\nStill, I just can\u2019t promise I won\u2019t sleep in (at least sometimes) on the weekends."

I wake up every morning with the intention of practicing, however, the fact that I don\u2019t wake up at a scheduled time, but do have to be to work at a scheduled time, means I don\u2019t always have an adequate number of minutes to dedicate to a morning practice.\nYes, I could set an alarm to wake up at a certain time everyday, but I find that alarms don\u2019t really work for me. I\u2019m naturally an early riser, and I always wake up with enough time to get ready for work (and only sometimes with enough time to practice and get ready), but I don\u2019t do well with an alarm. Whenever I wake up to an alarm (as opposed to naturally waking up when my body is ready), I always feel tired all day.\nI do so much better at work, and with all my personal tasks when I feel well rested. Plus, if you ask me, there\u2019s nothing worse than feeling tired all day. Sleep is important to my health and wellbeing \u2013 and not just mine, but everyone\u2019s. The thing is, getting just the right amount of rest that my body needs everyday is important to me. It\u2019s more important than fitting in a yoga sesh. That\u2019s why I put my sleep above my practice.\nI\u2019ve done the whole alarm-clock-get-up-with-enough-time-to-practice-everyday-routine thing, and it simply wasn\u2019t serving me. I thought that trying to make myself get up everyday and practice in the mornings would help me with my anxiety, but I actually found that quite the opposite was true. It felt like another full time job. Like just one more thing to add to my list of things I had to do. That\u2019s not what I wanted yoga to become. That\u2019s not what it\u2019s for. My yoga practice is for me, and it serves me a whole lot better when I do it in the moments that feel right as opposed to moments that are forced. Maybe one day, I\u2019ll have enough stability in my life to wake up at the same time everyday and dive into my practice. For now, that is not where I am. And I\u2019m okay with that.\nFortunately, I do wake up with enough time to practice at least a few days a week. And I always try to make time to go to a class, or at least do my own practice at home on the weekends. I do what works so that yoga can remain a blessing in my life. And for now, that\u2019s all I need to feel successful as a yogi.\nPosted on May 25, 2017 June 13, 2017 by AlexPosted in health, Lifestyle, YogaTagged Morning Routine, Morning Yoga Practice, Practice Yoga, Routine, Yoga, yoga practice, Yogi.\nWe definitely have the same philosophy. I try to do a 15 minute morning session during the week. I go to a class on Saturday and give myself a break on Sunday. This past week I maybe got 2 of my morning sessions in. My baby kept me busy.

                            "text": "Did you know that it\u2019s possible to get your toddler to sleep in in the mornings by using an alarm clock?\nYou\u2019re probably reading this thinking \u201cHow on earth am I going to get my toddler to read an alarm clock?\u201d. Don\u2019t worry; I won\u2019t be springing flashcards and worksheets on you as a prerequisite to a quiet morning. What I use with my toddler is what is known as a toddler alarm clock or a sunrise clock.\nThis past summer my youngest decided to become an early bird and started waking up at 5:30 am. I also happened to be going through the first trimester of my third pregnancy. So my son and I developed a routine of lying on the couch watching morning cartoons and eating toast.\nHowever, I wanted my mornings back, so I brought our toddler alarm clock ( a Gro Clock) out of storage.\nWhat is a Toddler Alarm Clock?\nA toddler alarm clock is a clock that uses cues like lights and images rather than time to show a toddler when it is time to wake up. There are a ton of options for toddler alarm clocks. It looks like while the Gro Clock is by far the most popular option, in the States, the Ok To Wake Up Clock by Mirari is the go-to option. Like the Gro Clock, it features different colours for night and day to teach your toddler when to wake up.\nWhat is a Gro Clock?\nThe Gro Clock is a super smart sunrise clock designed to teach toddlers when they can get up. Mine features two modes. The nighttime mode shows an image of stars and a blue light while the morning mode shows a sun image and a yellow screen. The idea is that you teach your toddler to stay in bed until the sun comes up each morning.\nDon\u2019t start using the Gro Clock when your toddler is too young.\nThe Gro Clock website suggests starting to use the clock for toddlers 2 and up. However, I started using the clock with my daughter at around 18 months and with my son at about 17 months. I wouldn\u2019t suggest starting much younger than that as your baby won\u2019t understand the concept.\nIf you purchase a Gro Clock, it will come with a storybook to help explain the clock to your toddler. However, by the time we were using the clock on our second child, the book had vanished, and I taught my son about the clock without its help. What we did do was practice saying hello to the stars every night before bed. Then in the morning, I made a point of saying hello to the sun on the clock.\nWhile it is so tempting to put in a wake-up time of 7 am and call it a day that\u2019s not how a toddler alarm clock works. Start by setting the alarm for your toddler\u2019s earliest wake-up time. What you\u2019re aiming for is for the clock to be in morning mode when they wake up. Then, once they are used to seeing the sun every morning (for us it took a few weeks) then start changing the wake-up time VERY slowly. Increase the time by 5 minutes at a time or at the most 10 minutes until you\u2019ve reached a reasonable wake-up time.\nWhile your toddler is learning about using a sunrise clock, it is so important to be consistent. Make sure you\u2019re a few things.\nUse this clock every single night. Make sure that at bedtime you and your toddler are watching the clock change to its nighttime mode. And, make sure you\u2019re telling your toddler that you will see them when the sun comes up.\nYour toddler may wake up before their scheduled wake up time. Always wait and see if your toddler is willing to play quietly in their crib before rushing into their room. I found that my son was about 50/50 for this. Some mornings I would hear him happily chatting away with his bunnies while on others he was screaming for me after 5 minutes (usually because he had pooped).\nSome mornings you may have to go into your toddler\u2019s room before their scheduled wake up time. When you do go into their room make sure you subtly manually change the clock to the morning mode. Then, before you get your toddler out of their crib comment on the clock. I would always make a point of pointing at the sun on the dial and saying something like \u201cLook! The sun is up and that means you can get up. Good morning sun\u201d.\nDo you need to use a reward chart?\nWhile the makers of the Gro Clock suggest using a sticker reward chart while your toddler is leaning I never have. I avoid reward charts like the plague, mostly because I always seem to run out of steam when using them. I\u2019ve managed to get both of my children successfully waking up at a designated wake-up time without using a single reward chart. However, if your toddler loves sticker charts and is not catching on to the alarm clock concept, then it\u2019s something you could try.\nIt\u2019s been almost four months since I started using our Glo Clock with my toddler. He\u2019s gone from a 5:30 wake up time to a 7 am wake up. I\u2019ve even had a few mornings where I\u2019ve forgotten to set his clock, and I\u2019ve had to go it and get him at 7:15 because he\u2019s just happily playing in his crib waiting for the sun to come up. Every morning I hear \u201csun, sun, sun\u201d coming from his room when his clock changes to morning mode and we know it\u2019s time to start the day.\nMy morning has changed too. Right now I\u2019m writing this blog post in my now child-free morning time before my kids are up. Most mornings I\u2019m able to have a shower without any children around and get things organized for the day. I\u2019m expecting another baby in the Spring and with that, my morning routine will change again. However, as with my first two kids, my third is going to be trained with a Gro Clock as soon as possible.\nIf your mornings have been taken over by an early riser, then I suggest you try a toddler alarm clock too."

One Saturday morning, he forgot to turn his alarm off since it wasn't a school day. About 6 AM, I heard the air raid siren going off across the hall, thinking, \"Really? Really?! REALLY?!\" And it didn't turn off... it just kept blaring it's warning that something ominous and hideous was about to happen. After an eternity of at least a minute and a half, I got up and went to turn it off with my fist, because he obviously was already up and out somewhere doing something. But NO, he was asleep! The air raid siren of doom was blasting it's obnoxious refrain right beside his ear and he was still ASLEEP!\nWe are meant to live awakened. But I know many people who are still asleep.\nI think a lot of us miss this aspect of Christ, because we get caught up in the religious aspect of what we believe vs. what \"they\" believe. But Jesus comes to give us life to the full. Jesus comes to be the Kingdom of God's love in and through us.\nIn the Bible, Romans 8 describes how the Spirit of God awakens us to light and life and love. And it's a beautiful wake up call that sounds more like \"Don't Worry, Be Happy\" and \"Celebration\" than an air raid siren signaling impending doom. And people sleep through it.\nOne of the best ways I have discovered to live awakened is to spend time every day, in intentional appreciation of creation. Spending 5-15 minutes (and often much more) every day outside (or looking out the window on days that are stupid cold), can awaken you to new understandings of God's nature and your own purpose. You should try it! Take note of colors, trees, plants, animals, clouds, stars, shapes... everything! Then note what new things you discover about the world, God, and yourself. May you receive this day as the gift it is intended to be."

You\u2019re tired all day, achy, sore, grumpy.\nWhat if you could get in bed, fall asleep, wake up refreshed, and feel great all day by changing one tiny aspect of your nighttime routine?\nResearch shows that sleeping with a pillow between your legs can help you align your spine, get more restful sleep, even breathe better if you have sleep apnea.\nWho needs a pillow between their legs?\nYou do! Anyone can benefit from sleeping with a pillow between their legs.\nIt helps align the spine, keeping the vertebrae from twisting during the night and reducing pressure between the legs and knees.\nIf you have sleep challenges like sleep apnea, research shows that by keeping you sleeping your side, a pillow between the knees can reduce the amount of times you stop breathing during the night. While you should still consult your doctor for a proper treatment method, a pillow between the knees is often recommended.\nSleeping with a pillow between the legs is also beneficial for pregnant women who discover suddenly that their belly needs support too! A woman\u2019s body is home to a growing baby, and it needs all the support it can get\u2014from pillows and a restful night\u2019s sleep.\nPutting a pillow between your legs can align your spine. Sleeping with your spine aligned takes pressure off the delicate joints in your vertebra.\nA pillow between your knees can also release tension in the lower back, preventing muscle pain upon waking and during the day. It releases strain on your hips.\nAnd as stated above, it keeps you balanced laterally and reduces the amount of times you stop breathing if you have sleep apnea.\nHow should I position a pillow between my knees as I sleep?\nSleeping with a pillow between your legs is best done when sleeping on your side. Bend your knees and pull them up toward your chest. Make sure your head is pillowed too.\nIf the pillow under your head is too tall, you will lose all the benefits of sleeping with your spine aligned. You should be able to move from your left side to your right and bring your pillow with you.\nTry to move your whole body at once and avoid twisting, which can injure your spine.\nThere are a variety of pillows on the market to help you sleep with your spine aligned. They vary in price, but a contoured memory foam pillow is just the right shape to help you stay aligned.\nYou may even find specialist pillows that wrap around your whole body, supporting your knees and back. It\u2019s also recommended to purchase a pillow with moisture-wicking fabric, in case you sweat in your sleep.\nThe important point is to get the pillow that fits right for you and keeps you aligned. Memory foam is best for this since it contours to your shape. Sleeping with the wrong pillow can cause a-s much damage as sleeping with no pillow.\nSleeping with a pillow between your legs can relieve pain, help you get a good night\u2019s sleep, and support your spine where you need it."

Doors opening and shutting with accompanying bangs and creaks where heard by everybody during the night\u2026 when nobody was moving about.\nAnd in one room, an investigator from the Hull group saw a man appear, reflected around her in the mirrored walls and ceiling!\nHowever, after an hour alone in there all I felt was the effects of spending too long sat on a very uncomfortable wooden bench!\nI do wonder how many people watched us on Haunted\u2019s webcams on their webpage, and wondered what on earth I was doing just sitting there. Nothing exciting happened in my room, so after a quick comfort break we switched rooms.\nThe Dining Room, where a number of visitors during the day had seen an old woman in black, proved to be only slightly more interesting as my second choice of room. Whilst in there, i heard somebody talking in the next room over, the Mirror Room, and thought they must be having a much more interesting night than I was.\nLittle did I know that Sara from HPGS, who bravely went in to a room she hated and sat in the pitch darkness, had just had a very unpleasant figure appear before her. Sara was a star: after a break to get over the shock, it must have taken her some guts to go back through the room to take part in the finale, a vigil involving both teams in the Seance Room, but she did it.\nWhat a pity anybody watching on the webcams couldn\u2019t see our reaction when we heard the doors opening and closing, our first thought was that somehow somebody had broken in to the building. We sped off to investigate and found nothing. I would be interested to hear from anybody who was watching on webcam and saw several of us moving through the rooms quickly as to whether they\u2019d seen doors opening and closing shortly before they saw us. With one exception each time it happened we were in our break room which isn\u2019t on webcam, the only other time we heard it we were in the Seance Room at the end of the night but the noise came from downstairs (the Seance Room is at the top of the building).\nBoth PSI and HPGS will be helping out at Haunted\u2019s attempt to set a new record for the World\u2019s Biggest Ghost Vigil, which will be taking place on Hallowe\u2019en on the Eye of York (next to Clifford\u2019s Tower). At 7.30pm events will start including ghost stories, psychic readings, dowsing, remote viewing and live video links to investigations at other haunted locations in York. The attempt at breaking the record will be at 9.30pm. Its free to come along, although donations to charity (York Stables Educational Project) are welcome.\nAfterwards, there will be s\u00e9ances and a paranormal investigations at Haunted as the teams from PSI and Hull Paranormal Ghost Society will be conducting a short series of s\u00e9ances, followed by an overnight investigation. S\u00e9ances will be on a first come, first served basis between 10.30pm and midnight, the overnight investigation is ticket only, and will cost \u00a320 a head.\nRemember: keep your equipment dry, and your coffee strong.\nThis entry was posted in Uncategorized and tagged festival, ghost, ghostfest, haunt, haunted, hpgs, paranormal, psi, rachel lacy, stonegate, york.

                            "text": "\u201cCome and look at this,\u201d my father said with a tone in his voice I recognized as meaning it was something interesting.\nI walked over to our kitchen table curiously. He had a book. It was actually a huge book and leather-bound.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bible,\u201d explained my Dad.\nIt was a large and heavy, black, leather-bound bible. It looked quite old too.\nThe inside cover of this huge family bible was written in and once I got used to the old fashioned hand writing, I realised it was a four generation family tree. Did it mark the path through the family that this bible had taken?\nAs if answering my mental question, Dad told me that the Bible had been acquired in the 17th Century and passed down through several generations of the family. That family was now extinct. It had died out with the recent death of the old lady who had given Dad this bible for safe keeping.\nI found this bible fascinating. It\u2019s age, the smell of the paper, the strange typeface used, the binding and leather cover that was embossed in a strange design. It was a mysterious book in many respects.\nWe examined the book for quite a while and then my Father packed it in paper and took it up to the attic where it would stay at least for the time being. We thought nothing more of that bible.\nIn the days and weeks that followed, strange things began to happen in the house. It started with creaks and groans, unexplained bangs and crashes from the attic. \u201cJust the heating and cooling of the rafters,\u201d my Dad told us reassuringly. But things didn\u2019t improve and if anything, steadily got worse. Nights were filled with strange sounds and sudden crashes that woke us all up. Added to some of the other things that I was experiencing at the time, it meant I hardly slept through fear. I would lay there waiting for the sounds to start and then when they did growing more and more jumpy and afraid as they continued through the night.\nUnfortunately however, other sounds began to emerge from the attic. Deep sighs that sounded as if the most depressed person you had ever met just let out their last death rattle. Then there were the slow, dragging footsteps punctuated with those horrible deep sighs of despair and followed by a few more footsteps.\nI wasn\u2019t the only one hearing these sounds every night and I met my father on one or two occasions armed with flashlight heading up the vertical pull-down ladder into that little square hole in the roof at the top of the stairs. He was investigating those sounds although mostly he just muttered something about me getting back to bed.\nThe sounds were truly scary. Imagine if every night it sounded like some one or some thing was slowly moving around your attic amongst crashes and creaks, sighs and groans. The hairs stood up on the back of my neck hearing those sounds as the cold hands of fear seemed to clasp around my neck slowly strangling me.\nAs abruptly as they started, they stopped. I noticed almost immediately and finally slept. No noises that night nor the next or the next. In fact, the noises were gone and never returned.\nIt was only several years later that I happened to be talking to my Dad about the noises that an explanation emerged.\n\u201cIt was that bloody bible I am sure of it,\u201d said my father somewhat to my surprise.\n\u201cBible? you mean that big family bible you showed me that day?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cYes, that one. It always did give me a bad feeling and that family never really liked us so I had wondered why we were given it. One night, I went up in the attic and found the damn thing. I took it down, placed it in one of those old biscuit tins and then the next day, I buried it at the bottom of the garden. Seemed to work,\u201d he added looking at me with a grin.\nWho knows if it was that bible or what the sounds really were but one thing is for sure, if you one day happen to dig up an old biscuit tin that contains an old leather family bible, throw it away as quick as you can.\nIf you enjoyed this story you will also like my novel \u2013 The Last Observer. Its on offer right now on Kindle."

                            "text": "I have heard it said that growing old stinks. The creaks and groans in the joints and the general wear and tear on the body and mind take their toll as the years march by. But those things are not what I think of as I grow older. What I think of most is how little my children need me anymore.\nMy birthday and Halloween are always the same week so reflecting on aging is natural even though I still feel young. Oh sure, the little aches and pains that I never had before are no fun, but the pain I feel when I think about my kids growing up is more heart wrenching. Do not get me wrong. There are days when I am ready for the boys to move out. When their push to be independent gets to me and I want to just throw my hands in the air and say, \u201cI quit.\u201d But being a parent is more than full time and I cannot help but keep trying to do my job however old they get. And it is a job that I will never quit doing. Regardless of whether they want me to or not.\nI suppose this growing old thing has gotten me a little melancholy this year, but it also brings with it smiles and resolve.\nI love to carve pumpkins. We used to do it when I was a kid and we used to do it every year when the boys were growing up. The past few years though have brought a drought of pumpkins. Thing 3 has been a tween or teen and could not be bothered with such things. Thing 2 is always busy busy busy, so even if he wanted to carve pumpkins, his schedule has left him with little time on his hands. Thing 1 is on his own and works a different schedule every week. All of these circumstances have let the pumpkin carving fall off the schedule of life events. Which was probably the biggest reason for my Halloween melancholy this year.\nBut no more. No more crying in my own soup. No more wishing the kids were younger. No more feeling sorry for myself.\nI have decided that age does have its advantage. Even though I am not an old dotard (I know that is redundant), I can exert some of my age privileges. I can tell my children that I need them to carve pumpkins with me. I can tell them that I need them to play games with me. I can tell them that they just need to come visit their dear old dad. And I am not going to wait any longer to do it.\nI am going to exert my privilege on my children because I do not want to just relive old memories. I do not want to look longingly at old pictures of our Jack o\u2019lanterns and other carved masterpieces and wonder where the time has gone. Neither do I want to rent children to take out trick or treating. (I do not miss the cold and wet Halloween nights prevalent in the Northwest.) All I want to do is spend some time with my family. Carving pumpkins.\nWe will not have those pumpkins carved and ready for Halloween night this year, but I am through with this pity party I have been throwing for myself. My kids are going to be as busy as ever, but I am still going to invite them to spend time with me. And we are going to carve pumpkins or play games on my birthday (or before). Every year. If I can remember.\nI suppose getting older does have its privileges. Even if those aches and pains and creaks and groans are more frequent. Even if one foot is in the grave as they say. I for one am not going to lament any longer. Even if they are right and growing old really does stink."

                            "text": "AD 675 \u2013 A time when London was still Saxon. Before William the Conqueror and the Battle of Hastings. Before the Tower of London. A time between the departure of the Romans and the beginning of a new era of Norman occupation. It was during this time that a church was built on a slight rise near the river. Begun on the foundations of an old Roman building, the church that rose from this spot is today known as the oldest church in London. And is a virtual time capsule of the history of London\u2026as well as an excellent place to wait out a springtime thunderstorm.\nThat\u2019s exactly what I found myself doing one April afternoon in London. The rainstorm had popped up out of nowhere forcing me to take cover or get wet. I ducked inside the church to wait it out. Inside was very quiet and there were only a few people. The first thing that struck me was the windows. I\u2019ve never seen anything quite like them. Unlike other English churches, these were mostly plain glass panes. Uniformly laid out across each window were the coat of arms for various people, military units, and guilds that have had an association with the church at one time or another. You could actually see the rain falling outside unlike most church windows that are made entirely of stained glass. These windows replaced the original ones damaged by raids carried out by the Germans during World War II.\nLike London itself, I soon discovered that this church has many layers. Peeling back each layer allows you to explore over one thousand years of London history. For example, an original Saxon archway built sometime between the 7th and the 11th century, still remains intact in the church of today. Originally built of recycled Roman roof tiles, it was exposed during the World War II blitz that ravaged London.\nLeaving the main nave and descending into the crypt, you find yourself walking in the footsteps of the Romans as you encounter original floors from a 2nd century house that once sat where the church is now. Back during a time when London was called Londinium more than a millennia ago. Moving through the narrow passage of the crypt, Saxon arches stand solidly overhead as you moved through the foundations of the 14th century church. Along the way are relics discovered in the foundations of the church and now put on display int he crypt museum.\nDuring the rebuilding of parts of the church after World War II, a portion of a Saxon cross was unearthed from the 9th century. It now sits in the crypt as part of a larger exhibit. Down in the crypt, the sound of the thunder from the passing storm outside was all but silenced. As I walked over the uneven paving stones, past Roman floors, it felt as if London\u2019s layers of stone and dust had peeled back to reveal the London of old underneath. Still in place and waiting all those years to be rediscovered.\nNot only does All Hallows contain Roman and Saxon relics, there is also an underground chapel in the crypt that has an alter dating back to the Crusades. The stones of the alter are from a Crusader castle in Israel. It was believed to have been carried on crusade by King Richard II, a son of the Black Prince and King of England in the late 14th century.\nBecause the church sits just beside the Tower of London, it also served another use during the Middle Ages. It was to this church that the remains of victims of the Tower Hill executioner were brought for temporary burial. Included among those who made their last stop here are Sir Thomas More, beheaded on Tower Hill by Henry VIII in the 16th century. In the 17th century, the church tower helped Samuel Pepys view the raging fire that swept through London from Pudding Lane, just missing the church itself.\nIf it hadn\u2019t been for the weather, I might not have visited this perfect time capsule of London history. As I descended back into the main church, the rain was letting up and the thunder was rumbling further in the distance. I stole a few moments more to sit on one of the pews and soak it in.\nSitting in the silence, with the gentle patter of raindrops on the payment outside was very peaceful. Something about knowing that everything surrounding me had survived from another age was reassuring. There was comfort in knowing that long after I walked through the door and out into the rain, this place would remain. Indications of lives lived and ages passing make London feel eternal\u2026.\n\u2026even if I\u2019m only just passing through."

All electrical appliances were unplugged, the lights were \u201ccut off\u201d, and we were warned not to touch paper or go near windows for they also \u201cdrew lightning\u201d. It was ALWAYS DARKEST DURING THE STORM!\nThis guy could NOT have been in the U.S. Navy because the first thing an American military man learns is to never volunteer for ANYTHING!\nJesus\u2019 disciples were also caught out on the sea by a sudden storm. Luckily for them, their Captain was the \u201cMaster of ocean and earth and skies\u201d. The winds and the waves shall obey His will with the utterance of three simple words, PEACE BE STILL! [Sang Creek Carter, SANG].\nMatthew 14:22-36 reads \u201cAnd straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before Him unto the other side, while He sent the multitudes away. And when He had sent the multitudes away, He went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.\nVerse 25 tells us that this miracle happened \u201cduring the fourth watch\u201d. The Hebrews had adopted the Roman custom of dividing the night into four \u201cwatches\u201d. The first watch spanned from about 6 o\u2019clock p.m. until 9 p.m. The second watch stretched from 9 p.m. until midnight. The third watch lasted from midnight until 3 o\u2019clock a.m. and the \u201cfourth watch\u201d was from 3 a.m. until 6 a.m. It was during the \u201cfourth watch\u201d, when the sky was at its blackest that the disciples struggled with their little boat against the raging storm. They felt that all hope was lost. They probably felt abandoned too.\nA wise man named Thomas Fuller (1608-1661), once wrote, \u201cIt is always darkest before the day dawneth\u201d. it was during a raging storm; in the darkest hour of the night; just before the dawn; when all seemed lost; that Jesus stepped out on the water and calmed the raging tempest and I believe that what He did then, He can do for US during our storms and during our darkest moments, IF WE JUST HAVE FAITH!\nAnd he sent forth a crow which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from the earth.\nSent shivers all over me Ron.\nA true old fashion \u2018testify\u2019.\nLots of truth here Ron. The storms of life are inevitable and after them there is clearer vision.\nYes, so many storms. Thanks guys.\nSo true and a much needed reminder now on so many levels."

I just wanted you to know how much I appreciate these two employees.\nShane appears to be talented and patient person. He has gone above and beyond his normal duties to help me with the ups and downs of buying a new home. Let me give you one example. In the main bedroom, the closet shelving completely collapsed to the floor. There was a small amount of damage done to the walls; and, of course the shelving had a few twists and turns. I called Shane. He and Jeremy came over, checked it all out and within a few minutes the manager and the installer of the shelving unit were at the house checking it all out. The shelving manager said he would take care of the situation immediately. Everything was repaired that day. The shelving installer even reinforced all the other closets. Jeremy repaired the walls. His workmanship was superb. You couldn\u2019t even tell anything had happened. I personally think both Shane and Jeremy are a huge credit to Tempest Homes. The position of dealing with the public can be very difficult. I have dealt with the public for over 40 years, and it takes a very special person to do a good job.\nThank you for taking the time to read this letter. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you and your family.\nMay the Good Lord bless you in the coming New Year.\nPS. Also, please thank Chuck Hollie and Andy for all their extra help.\n\"To everyone at Tempest homes, Rebecca Wright, Barney Scheumann, Shane Tyra and all the workers, thanks for everything you have done with making our home building an exceptional experience. Rebecca helped with all our wants and needs and listened to us while we made our choices, Barney and Shane and all the workers, what a beautiful house you have built. I watched every step of the way and was built perfectly. Again, Thanks for everything!\"\n\"Rebecca is a great realtor to work with, from start to finish! Her outgoing personality and loads of experience selling and buying real estate make working with her a great experience. She knows both the new and existing home markets inside and out. She listened to what we were looking for and helped us working through the entire home buying and selling processes. We appreciated her communication skills most of all. She kept us informed along the way and was always available (and willing) to answer our questions, honestly and quickly. We love our Tempest Home & are very grateful to the Tempest team for all of their hard work.\"\n\"I absolutely LOVE my Tempest Home & am so thankful to Rebecca Wright who helped to take care of us from start to finish through the \"build process\". From getting our mortgage in place, to getting us to the finish line and moving into our new home, she is the best Realtor out there. She is Incredibly knowledgeable & helped to be sure all our bases were covered. After we moved in, the warranty team has been tremendous. We have had zero need for help but having the 30 day & 11 month follow up walk through's as part of our warranty was another thing we never imagined having with a home. So, thanks to the Tempest Homes crew & Rebecca for making our house our home sweet home!\"\n\"We are very happy with our Tempest Home. Even after several years of living in our home are loving it. Rebecca took great care of us. Oh & we can't believe how low our utility bills are --- when they say the homes are built to be energy efficient, they mean it. The warranty department does a great job of following up too. We had an issue come up on New Year's Day. Thought for sure it would be impossible to get help. Not the case ... as was promised by the 24-hour call number - even on a holiday we were helped quickly & efficiently. I would recommend Tempest Homes & do quite often to friends, family, & coworkers.\"\nI want to extend a great thank you to you and your team. Jennifer and Chris did an amazing job at answering my questions and really made the process run smoothly. I would definitely recommend Tempest homes to anyone!\nI would recommend Tempest Homes to anyone that is looking for a professional, first class builder. From the beginning I was treated with respect, my ideas were listened to, and my questions answered. I love my home! The floor plan is perfect for now and for years to come. The materials used were of extreme quality and the workmanship followed suit. Everyone I met from the beginning through my closing date was helpful. I would recommend Tempest Homes to anyone looking for a builder. They are affordable, classy, and the best choice by far.\nMy experience with Tempest Homes and sales rep Chris Scheumann was overwhelmingly positive! As a single mother of three boys, I was in a position where I needed an affordable home in a respectable area in a timely manner. Thanks to Chris Scheumann and his team, that's just what I received. We love the convenience of the location and the quiet, safe neighborhood community is perfect for my three boys. Chris was readily available when questions arose, as was John Miller, in the service department. On the 30 day walk through John went over and above my expectations. Buying my home from Tempest was the best choice I've made since having my three sons!\n\"My name is Sue Ellen Irwin and my husband and I would like to take a moment to tell you about our wonderful experience working with Rebecca Wright of Tempest Homes. We have lived in a home for 30 years that has brought us wonderful memories and the many people only dream about living in. It became time to downsize and we felt completely overwhelmed about how to proceed. We had an opportunity to sell our home to someone we felt would love and care for it as much as we did. In our search for what we needed for our future we had the good fortune to meet Rebecca. She started out by asking what our vision for our future was. After we explained where we had been and where we saw our future going she did not rest until she has us finding exactly what we thought would work for us. She has been there for us every step of the whole process and gone far above any of our expectations. Our whole selling, buying and moving process has been a good experience because of Rebecca. I just wanted you to know how blessed we feel because our paths crossed. How lucky you are the she works for you.\"\nI just wanted to let everyone know how happy I am with my new house built by Tempest Homes. It is such a warm and comfortable house. They did a wonderful job in building it. Tempest Homes went above and beyond in making sure my house was as I wanted it. They even did extra little things like installing cabinets in the bathrooms that I had bought to go over the stools. Chris was always there to help me in making choices if I needed him to by letting me know where I could go look at a house with the items in it that I thought I might like. I would highly recommend having a house buillt by Tempest Homes. I'm sure you will well satisfied.\nChuck, You and your company are great! What an easy deal this was. You took care of everything. Came through on every promise. And this is a very well built home. I feel very lucky to have been able to work with you and will absolutely recommend you to anyone I can. Take care of yourself and again...Thanks! Mike Benner ps...Boiler Up!!!!\nMy husband and I bought a home at Lindberg Village in May, 2008. We would like to extend our thanks to you and your family/company for being so reputable and offering us a beautiful, well built home in a magnificent residential community. You and your company have kept your word every step of the way. We had some very minor work that needed to be corrected or replaced. As your documents suggested we contacted Mr. John Miller each time and he dealt with us in a very satisfactory and fair manner each time we have called. Mr. Miller is a gentleman and he takes care of concerns to our satisfaction each time. It is so refreshing and such a pleasure to have bought our home from a builder with \"class\", considering the day and age in which we live and the horror stories that we have heard/read about in many parts of the country in which we have lived. A few blocks from our home is the beautiful new library, which we enjoy. We understand from having read an article in the Journal and Courier that the land on which the library was built was donated by your father. Please let him know how much we appreciate his generosity. Again it has been a pleasure doing business with Tempest Homes.\n\"I've always heard that building a home was stressful. Working with Amy Moore at Tempest was the easiest experience I've ever had! This was actually fun! Amy was enthusiastic yet not pushy, and so pleasant to work with. I decided to go with Tempest over other builders because it was important to me to get an energy efficient home that was well built but within my budget. My house got a five level Energy Star rating. I absolutely love my new house!\"\n\"A very special thanks to everybody at Tempest homes. Everybody did an amazing job that words can't even describe, thanks again. Also another big thank you to Greg Wheeler my realtor, who hands-down is the best Realtor out there, talk about going above and beyond. Thank you Greg for all your hard work and dedication. It's a one-of-a-kind and very unique. Guarantee no one else has my master bathroom. It's definitely an oasis getaway.\"\n\"My son and I recently moved into our amazing handicap accessible home. This home was made a reality by the help and generosity of many over the last few years. This mission began with my dream to be able to provide for my disabled son the necessary means for all daily needs in his home environment. I am proud to say that we have achieved this dream and want to thank everyone whom contributed. We thank all the patrons, and business\u2019s that have participated in the Ashton Aynes Annual Gold Outings, everyone whom shoed their support at Ashton\u2019s Hot Box Pizza night; Linda Chases and Chuck Holle for donating the washer and dryer, Jennifer Vandame for too much to mention; Tempest Homes/Barney Scheumann, all the contractors for building this home and providing so many extras to make it the magnificent home that it is. I could go on and on with those I want to thank Carl Cadwallader, Laurie Wesling, Melanie Collier, Teamsters, Moose Lodge and the list goes on. Please know that even if you are not mentioned here we know who you are, we remember all of you, and you have touched our hearts in a way that will never be forgotten.\""

                            "text": "So you\u2019re doing some renovation work on your home, and for one reason or another, you notice that the walls, the crawl space, and foundations of your house are damaged and need to be repaired. Or you may have noticed that your home isn\u2019t sitting quite right on the earth it was built on.\nLet\u2019s say you didn\u2019t have a hand in the construction of your house, and you have no idea how it was built. What you may not know about your house and how it\u2019s built is that the type of soil it\u2019s standing on has a huge impact on how stable the foundations are, as well as how your house deals with moisture and times of flooding.\nUnderstanding the interaction between your house and the earth it\u2019s on, as well as the different types of soil your home is built on will help you repair it the best and most efficient way possible.\nHow does soil affect your foundations?\nBefore going into the different types of soil you can find, first let\u2019s go into the science of how soil and your home\u2019s foundations interact with each other.\nTo put simply, the earth your house is sitting on is made up of many different soil layers, built up over many, many years. Some of it has been put there by nature itself, while some of it was definitely dumped there by the contractors who built your home.\nAs the layers increase, the more the soil is able to bear the weight of the structure constructed on it. However, the hardest parts of the earth underneath it are very, very deep. What you should be more concerned about is the so-called active zone, or the layer of soil your house and its foundations are sitting right on top of. That active zone is directly affected by the weather and climate in your area, and different kinds of soil comprising the active zone will, in turn, directly affect your home.\nYou obviously wouldn\u2019t want foundation settlement to happen, as it could damage your house at the very least and destroy it at the extreme worst. We\u2019ll go into which types of soil are more likely to do which in the next section.\nLoam \u2013 The most ideal type of soil for your foundations, loam is made of a mixture of sand, clay, and silt. This mixture combined with temperate weather conditions is well-balanced and results in great moisture absorption, which is perfect for supporting your house\u2019s foundations. The downside of loam is erosion, which may leave the soil unable to support the weight of your home and its foundations when it happens.\nRock \u2013 Usually referring to sandstone, limestone, bedrock, or other kinds of rock, this type is the most solid and doesn\u2019t absorb moisture at all, making it a good material to support foundations. It just has to be properly prepared.\nClay \u2013 One of the most common soil types around. Clay is very expansive as it\u2019s composed of small particles that can easily shrink or expand, making it easy to mold when wet. Here\u2019s the thing about clay soil: you don\u2019t want to use it for shallow foundations (when you\u2019re adding rooms, for example) because in extreme temperatures, the soil can get either too wet, expanding the soil, or too dry, shrinking the soil and allowing more space to let water in. Clay soils commonly damage foundations.\nSand/gravel \u2013 Sand or gravel particles have relatively larger spaces in between them, which allows for no moisture retention. Water simply passes right through sand and it retains its volume and density. Because of this characteristic, sand or gravel is ideal for drainage systems and foundations in general so long as water doesn\u2019t wash the soil out. The only downside is that sand or gravel is fairly hard to come by.\nSilt \u2013 This type of soil has particles somewhere between the size of sand and clay, and it absorbs a lot of moisture. When it retains moisture, the soil swells up against the foundations, damaging them and making areas like the basement damp. Needless to say, silt isn\u2019t really ideal.\nPeat \u2013 This type of soil is made up of water and decomposing vegetation. Its softness obviously makes it unstable to build any foundation on, and if the soil around you is peat, you need to avoid it at all costs. Peat is usually found in wetter climates, near marshes and swamplands.\nIf your home is in danger of sinking, we can help get it to solid ground. We can help you identify how to approach foundation repair to your home with our foundation repair services. Our foundation repair team is one of the finest in Chattanooga, and we\u2019re ready and well-equipped to analyze the soil around and under the crawl space of your home and explain to you how we can fix it.

Open them and see the garish overtures of neon signs slyly winking at those restless souls drifting aimlessly through the night. They shuffle into dim, smoky bars with the air of penitents and lay down their coins on an altar to the banal, a paltry offering in exchange for free-flowing fermented indulgences.\nSomewhere, on a dark stage, the entrance of which is hidden by the gaping blackness of a narrow, peeling door that fades into the depths of a narrower, darker alley, a troubadour wields a melody as a cudgel.\nBut as the soft notes float through space they are lost, overpowered by the tinny chords blaring from the speakers atop the cheap plastic big top of a travelling circus across the way.\n\u201cVaudeville for the technological age!\u201d a fluorescent marquee boasts.\nBack on the darkened stage, the troubadour finishes his song and a roaring chorus of silence rises up to greet him. Exhausted, he lets his shoulders slump forward. Locks of baby-fine hair, the color of noontime summer sun reflecting off the pale green underside of young leaves, fall like a curtain across his brow. The black of midnight descends as the two shining spotlights of his eyes are extinguished.\nHere, in the lush darkness of his mind, images spring up unbidden. He sees flaming oak leaf missiles plummet from well-stocked arboreal armories. The languid tendrils of a breeze reach out and alter their trajectories. Cicadas sound an alarm while dragonfly generals surveil their carpet-bombing operation, resolute that the denizens of the forest floor will not survive. Stoic sparrow soldiers watch and wait for orders.\nUp in the heavens, cloud wraiths howl, throw their grey manes about and strike their chests. The conifer king bows his head solemnly in acknowledgment of the sacrifice his subjects have made. The sea spirits beat a funeral dirge for the fallen upon the unyielding feet of granite cliff giants, whose eternal vigil stymies their campaign to grow their water demesne.\nGrowth. The minstrel\u2019s eyes spring open and a shimmering pearl drips down the strings of his guitar, sending one high note up into the air, like the chirp of a small bird. It flutters about the ceiling, flapping its wings with increasingly desperate fury, then falls, exhausted, to the ground with an imperceptible downy thud.\nLife without impact, death without notice: in the grand temporal scheme, is that an existence? If so, why?\nWhy\u2014the unanswered question, hidden in plain sight.\nConfusion. The artist\u2019s mandate: be singular, have vision, but take from eternity, from the contributions of greatness past. Take. Just another word for thievery. Chew the flesh down until only gristle, and the pit of the soul, remain. But that particular seed is barren. Dropped into a pond, it plummets down to the murky depths frequented only by snaggle-tooth sea monsters, a vestige from time immemorial.\nThe troubadour\u2019s eyes droop. The shadowy forms of his Eden-like vision coalesce in the twilight of his subconscious. There is peace here. And freedom.\nFreedom. A myth? Be an individual. Produce. Create. But for others, under the direction of golden-calf idolaters who sell whatever appeases the hedonistic masses? That wasn\u2019t freedom. That was lockstep, like the foot soldiers of the tide advancing and retreating on the orders a celestial commandant.\nHe: dictatorial, untouchable and not to be challenged.\nThey: swollen with the importance of their charge. The advanced line of the reconnaissance parties of dawn\u2019s first light, shining their antiseptic credo only where directed. Lazy and weak, swerving hulking twilight demons whose bastions ringed the territory occupied by culture. Don\u2019t acknowledge these strategic weaknesses; what is ignored cannot be vanquished. Live to fight another day. An easy mantra for a conscripted soldier who can see the pitched field his general has chosen as a battle ground. Impossible for the lone crusader fighting guerilla shadow warriors.\nWelcome, seekers of the grey and grim."

It\u2019s better that I get this over with quick, I told myself, so I went up the stairs.\nI couldn\u2019t risk going out there with the wind so strong, but I wanted to go as high up, so I opened the door to the attic and climbed the latter.

He walked up in front of the two new dolls and looked them sternly in the eyes, but he could think of nothing to say so he pulled at his yarn mustache.\nMarcella had only received the two new dolls that morning. They had come in the morning mail and were presents from an aunt.\nMarcella had named the two new dolls Annabel-Lee and Thomas, after her aunt and uncle.\nAnnabel-Lee and Thomas were beautiful dolls and must have cost heaps and heaps of shiny pennies, for both were handsomely dressed and had real hair!\nAnnabel\u2019s hair was of a lovely shade of auburn and Thomas\u2019 was golden yellow.\nAnnabel was dressed in soft, lace-covered silk and upon her head she wore a beautiful hat with long silk ribbons tied in a neat bow-knot beneath her dimpled chin.\nThomas was dressed in an Oliver Twist suit of dark velvet with a lace collar. Both he and Annabel wore lovely black slippers and short stockings.\nThey were sitting upon two of the little red doll chairs where Marcella had placed them and where they could see the other dolls.\nQuite true. Uncle Clem was made of worsted and the moths had eaten his knees and part of his kiltie. He had a kiltie, you see, for Uncle Clem was a Scotch doll.\nUncle Clem shook, but he felt so hurt he could think of nothing to say.\nHe walked over and sat down beside Raggedy Ann and brushed her yarn hair away from her shoe-button eye.\nThe tin soldier went over and sat beside them.\n\u201cAnd the Soldier must have been made with a can opener!\u201d laughed Thomas.\nNow, that night Marcella did not undress the two new dolls, for she had no nighties for them, so she let them sit up in the two little red doll chairs so they would not muss their clothes. \u201cI will make nighties for you tomorrow!\u201d she said as she kissed them good night. Then she went over and gave Raggedy Ann a good night hug. \u201cTake good care of all my children, Raggedy!\u201d she said as she went out.\nNow, Annabel-Lee and Thomas were very tired after their long journey and soon they fell asleep and forgot all about the other dolls.\nWhen they were sound asleep, Raggedy Ann slipped quietly from her bed and awakened the tin soldier and Uncle Clem and the three tiptoed to the two beautiful new dolls.\nThey lifted them gently so as not to awaken them and carried them to Raggedy Ann\u2019s bed.\nRaggedy Ann tucked them in snugly and lay down upon the hard floor.\nThe tin soldier and Uncle Clem both tried to coax Raggedy Ann into accepting their bed (they slept together), but Raggedy Ann would not hear of it.\n\u201cI am stuffed with nice soft cotton and the hard floor does not bother me at all!\u201d said Raggedy.\nAt daybreak the next morning Annabel and Thomas awakened to find themselves in Raggedy Ann\u2019s bed and as they raised up and looked at each other each knew how ashamed the other felt, for they knew Raggedy Ann had generously given them her bed.\nThere Raggedy Ann lay; all sprawled out upon the hard floor, her rag arms and legs twisted in ungraceful attitudes.\nBoth new dolls were silent for a while, thinking deeply.\n\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d Thomas finally asked.\n\u201cAs soon as Raggedy Ann awakens, I shall tell her just how much ashamed I am of myself and if she can, I want her to forgive me!\u201d Thomas said.\n\u201cThe more I look at her, the better I like her!\u201d said Annabel.\n\u201cI am going to kiss her!\u201d said Thomas.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll awaken her if you do!\u201d said Annabel.\nBut Thomas climbed out of bed and kissed Raggedy Ann on her painted cheek and smoothed her yarn hair from her rag forehead.\nAnd Annabel-Lee climbed out of bed, too, and kissed Raggedy Ann.\nThen Thomas and Annabel-Lee gently carried Raggedy Ann and put her in her own bed and tenderly tucked her in, and then took their seats in the two little red chairs.\nFido had one fuzzy white ear sticking up over the edge of his basket and he gave his tail a few thumps against his pillow.\nRaggedy Ann lay quietly in bed where Thomas and Annabel had tucked her. And as she smiled at the ceiling, her candy heart (with \u201cI LOVE YOU\u201d written on it) thrilled with contentment, for, as you have probably guessed, Raggedy Ann had not been asleep at all!"

What are you searching for?\nThe turning of the year from light to darkness.\nIn the midst of the celebrations, the magic, the movement, is a point of stillness. The balance point before everything changes direction.\nI don\u2019t do being still very well, the turning began and the still point came and I didn\u2019t understand what was happening. What should I be doing?! I cried. And then I realised; this is the point of balance, the stillness, the moment when all time stands still. And I did the only thing I knew how to do with stillness\u2026 I danced with the stillness in painting.\nBefore this\u2026 The ritual I assisted at was preceded by an hour long obstruction instead of the preparation time expected. Finally I stood still in confrontation without that overflowing of the oceans which spill themselves as tears. I surprised myself by remaining calm, drawing on the stillness that resides within.\nThe year-wheel tipped into motion again and the week following Halloween was filled with sparks, with changes, with moments of magic. Things began again \u2013 the darkness rising, the winter coming.\nRight through to the Night of Fireworks. It should come as no surprise that the wheel is too huge to change direction in just one night.\nAnd now we are sinking into the darkness. The time when stillness is more important than ever. The time of reflection, while the sun gives us space to breathe and go within, while the land recovers and asks us to rest and heal our bodies.\nCan I spend more time in the stillness? Can I say No to some of the activities which present themselves as opportunities? At least for long enough to strengthen and heal. To gather strength for the spring which will follow winter as surely as the cold is filling the land.\nBones are calling. My mind turns to thoughts of the dead, ancestors of blood and spirit. My altar shifted and now reflects the song of the dead whispering on the winds, the deep water, the cauldron of the night.\nThis winter I will be seeking stillness.\nIn the chaos of life.\nIn the endless activities and the calm carved from the storm.\nMany things still need doing this wintertide and between them I shall seek the stillness. I am learning, slowly, that a time to rest and reflect is as important as a time to act. I can only act well when I come from a place of stillness, from a rested place, a place where I gather my energies. The tools which will help me? Reflection. Meditation. Musing. Breathing.\nWhat will you seek this winter? And how will you seek it out?"

Ask me again in a couple of weeks.\nOh, yes, Stacey ... I am already longing for Spring outside, but I'm looking forward to the peacefulness of January and February inside, too, when things slow down and I get in my \"organizing mode.\" I hope to accomplish a lot in the next few weeks.\nBest wishes to you and your family for a new year filled with an abundance of blessings and joy.\nHope you had a wonderful Christmas and are enjoying your break from teaching.\nBut winter has its own wonderful things to enjoy too!! The peacefulness of it all, the clear blue sky on a cold day, staying inside and doing home nesting things with hot coffee (or hot chocolate late at night), and electric blankets!\nIt is a cold day here in MI. and I would love to be out in my flower garden right now! You are not alone.\nI like my cozy winter clothes and haven't grown tired of the cold YET!\nI am sure by the end of jan. I will be changing my tune.\nUm...oh gosh. I want so much to agree with you. I do! I do! but..not really. Not yet. Just a bit more rain and cold weather...just a bit more. Christmas came and went so fast. It's not that I am not glad the Christmas crush is over, I am, but..I do so love Fall and Winter.\nHowever..give me another month...and I will ...just move over! I'll join you in that boat on that peaceful lake, sitting by the pond, sipping lemonade. You know? So wait just a bit more and I will be on board!\nIn New England we blink our eyes and the weather pattern changes. Sunday's snowfall was our first measured in inches, so we are enjoying it! When it feels a tad too chilly, I remember the HHH of summer. 4 seasons are great!\nHappy New Year to you & your fam, Stacey!\nThank you for stopping by to visit. You have a beautiful yard, I can see why you are anxious to be in it again! On the bright side, the days are getting longer, so it won't be long now.\nI miss my garden, too.

I like how it tells the Christmas story from the beginning. The very beginning.\nAfter reading Genesis 1:24-31, I enjoyed this part of the devotion: The Christmas story, it begins in the beginning. And in the beginning there was no life. No breath. No warmth. No wind or light or laughter or stars or waves, just cold, empty nothingness. Like life before Christ.\n\u2026 And then just like a branch came forth out of a deadened stump, out of the darkness came forth His voice, an echo in the emptiness. Out of the black nothingness \u2014 glorious something!\nThanks, Ann Voskamp, for your words. They got me thinking while I was laying in bed the other night while the three other people in my family slept. The house was quiet. My room was dark, except for my book light.\nBefore the kids wake up and after they go to sleep, mornings and nights are calm in my house. It\u2019s dark and usually cold because we all hate to be hot when we sleep. Then we awake and they awake and our days begin. Life becomes noisy, colorful, bustling and joyful. All so it can repeat again after our world calms and we rest.\nMy house isn\u2019t supposed to be cold and dark and quiet. It\u2019s supposed to be full of life. Our lives.\nI\u2019m so thankful life is lived here. And, more importantly, I\u2019m thankful for the life we have because Jesus was born on what probably wasn\u2019t so much of a silent night.\nIt\u2019s worth dancing about, even it\u2019s all a little messy.\nI needed to read this tonight. My life is a little messy right now and you provided the perfect reminder.\nLoved your thoughts and love the song. They actually sang it at the concert in Paducah. The lead singer reminded me so much of Gary. He wore suade oxford shoes, tan corduroy jacket and tan khaki's. That was always Gary's uniform of choice in the winter. Good memories."

The Dark Moon guides us full tilt into the depth of Winter. Remember, darkness isn\u2019t the absence of light, darkness is its very own entity. Consider dark energy not as a negative or maleficent force but an unseen force of acceleration and expansion. You may find that residing deep within the subaqueous stillness of Winter there is an opulent source of wisdom after all.\nNovember\u2019s Full Moon is known as the Dark Moon and signifies the embrace of the cold, lightless season of Winter. Occurring in Gemini, this Moon will manifest for most in either a myopic or a holographic lens through which they experience life and the Universe. Both perspectives will provide an education on what thrives in you while all else hibernates. Embrace the journey with Bacchanalian gusto, as if each new awareness is a fine wine to be sniffed and sipped and clucked over. You may find that residing deep within the subaqueous stillness of Winter there is an opulent source of wisdom after all.\nThe Dark Moon guides us full tilt into the depth of Winter. Remember, darkness isn\u2019t the absence of light, darkness is its very own entity. Cosmology and Astronomy both identify a form of Energy known as Dark Energy. This is the phenomenon of an unknown form of energy hypothesized to permeate all of space and tending to accelerate the expansion of the universe. Where could this kind of dark energy live in you? Consider dark energy not as a negative or maleficent force but an unseen force of acceleration and expansion. What force permeates all of you and drives you to expand?\nAs this Full Moon occurs in Gemini, one can use the Twins\u2019 qualities to explore the forces of dark energy in themselves. Gemini embodies strong communication skills and of course, duality. Perhaps it\u2019s time to confront those forces in opposition within you and have a dialogue with yourself about how or why they began their residency? Or maybe those forces you feel in opposition with are exogenous and require you to address them with well-thought out and clear communication mechanisms?\nThese internal or external struggles are important to attend to in our lives and you\u2019ll have a better measure of success this Full Moon when you remember that in darkness you can utilize different senses than sight to gather information with.\nWhen the field of vision is dimmed some become hyper-aware of inner sensations and immediate physical stimuli while others tap into a collective consciousness, a global awareness that can feel overwhelming in it\u2019s vastness or protective in its anonymity. While these perspectives are different neither holds greater currency in the journey of awareness in the dark. Whatever resource comes to you, embrace it, celebrate it, wash it down with wine and cheese, exploring in the dark requires a lot of energy. Allow yourself to be reinvigorated by good food, community, healthy indulgences and laughter during this time because Baby when you\u2019re truly doing the good work it\u2019s easy to build up an appetite and your ravenousness informs your willingness to keep diving into the work. The dark doesn\u2019t last forever, let the tides of feelings and emotions swell and warm you, they will always recede again.\nThis Full Moon enjoy the season of darkness, find the plenty in the quiet and feel the acceleration of the universe in each and every cell of your body. There is tranquility for you there in the dark, rest in the expansion of the Universe and recognize that you\u2019re an intrinsic part of it.\nSo glad to hear that, Kathy! We really enjoyed Jamie\u2019s insight and perspective as well. Enjoy the beautiful full moon and holiday!"

Here you can clearly see a lot of activity 542-550MHz. I think this is a DVB-t (digital TV) signal. There is another very interesting signal at the end of this spectrum but I have no idea what is this. Only one of the 3 dongles was able to receive it, perhaps because the antenna of the dongle that received this signal is horizontal.\nWe have at least 3 interesting signals here, at ~ 621, 668 and 692MHz.

It was captured with 3 RTL SDRs connected to wire antennas of different lengths and with different orientations. At the end of this spectrum you can see a part of a signal where normally I would expect LTE, but it looks a bit strange for that. In the first part there is something that appears only on the first radio but I couldn't say for sure what is that.\nThis one was also captured with 3 RTL SDRs connected to wire antennas of different lengths and with different orientations. Normally here I would expect to see 4G mobile network signals here but apparently in Romania we use a different frequency for those. Nevertheless, you can see some intermittent signals at 868MHz.\nAlso captured with 3 RTL SDRs connected to wire antennas of different lengths and with different orientations. This spectrum is very quiet here but there is a very interesting signal at 1047.5MHz. Of course, at 1090MHz there are the ADS-B signals which allows us to track the position of airplanes."

The Napoli boss revealed he did speak with the Frenchman when he stepped down - but not about the manager\u2019s position.\nArsene Wenger walked away from the Arsenal hotseat at the end of last season and Carlo Ancelotti was among the many names reported to be on the shortlist of his replacements.\nUnai Emery was ultimately given the job and his side face a tough test hosting Napoli tonight in the Europa League\u2019s quarter-finals.\nAncelotti, though, admitted having a conversation with Wenger last year but insisted their talks moved swiftly away from the topic of football.\n\"I spoke with Arsene, he is a good friend of mine, when we had a meeting in Geneva, but not before,\" he said.\nArsenal vs Napoli TV channel: What TV channel is Arsenal v Napoli on?\n\"I was not involved in the new era of Arsenal without Arsene.\n\"I sometimes talk with him but not about his replacement.\n\"We talk wine, food, Italian food, French food.\"\nAncelotti was full of praise for Emery ahead of tonight\u2019s clash at the Emirates.\nThe Spaniard won three successive Europa League titles when in charge of Sevilla and the Napoli boss feels the current Arsenal side cannot be compared to Wenger's reign.\n\"(It is) a totally different story,\" he added.\n\"They are different managers with a different style and a different team because new players arrived and so it is a new era.\n\"But Arsenal is still competitive in the Premier League and in Europe, we have a lot of respect of this team, this club and we are honoured to play this quarter-final against them.\n\"Unai Emery is, in my opinion, a fantastic manager with a lot of knowledge.\n\"He has experience of this kind of game and the fact he is on the bench of Arsenal will be more difficult for us.\"\nAncelotti also fondly remembers leading Bayern Munich to a 10-2 thrashing of Arsenal two years ago.\nHowever, he insists his current Napoli side face a different proposition against the Gunners this time around.\nWhen asked about the tie, Ancelotti said: \"If I say I forgot it is not true.\n\"I didn't forget this but each game is a different story, imagine every season different clubs, different manager so it will a totally different story. That game with Bayern is only a good memory.\""

It seemed to be a competition for the duration of the journey to not let anything pass and to pass by any means possible anything that was in front.\nAdd to that all the other hazards outside the drivers control on roads that had NO rules I have to say that travelling around India was not a pleasant experience.\nMy best tactic was to close my eyes and pretend I was sleeping so I wouldn't have to watch the mayhem ensue and remain in a state of tension for hours on end.\nOne day on a 3 hour drive to the airport with a driver that resembled a \"bat out of hell\" (His driving style only!) the guy in the front seat stuck on a CD.

Several hours in the small kitchen cooking pancakes, blending a smoothie, assembling supper in the crock pot, and scrambling a big lunch together in between a trip to the bustling Farmers\u2019 Market and executing an afternoon excursion had stolen every last bit of energy I had left. I simply wanted to curl up in bed and decompress.\nMy ears picked up a familiar pattering outside the window.\nI splashed my face one last time luxuriating in a soft towel before stepping across the bathroom to the window.\nMy ears were not playing tricks on me.\nA familiar sound for me, but a displaced sound in this dry California valley: the soft pattering of raindrops!\nWe\u2019d watched thin clouds float in all day, faintly gray and hinting of hope, though nowhere near as promising as the monster thunderheads that pile up at home before a spring storm. I was skeptical, especially when the forecast only predicted a forty percent chance of falling water.\nMy two oldest children were still awake, waiting for their piano music on Pandora to lull them to sleep. We\u2019d never seen rain in California before, so I motioned them out of bed to witness the historic phenomenon outside their window. After all, it would probably only last a few minutes, and those precious drops would drizzle away to faint memories.\nI tip-toed back to my room, terrifying the cat in the process. I\u2019m sure we confused her, these strangers who invaded her fortress every summer and kept unpredictable hours.\nAs I pulled the warm duvet over my shoulders, I noticed the gentle dripping was already gone. Only the soothing trickle of the neighbor\u2019s deck fountain remained to keep me company. Just as I had predicted, it was merely a cruel taste of the elusive rain that California is so parched for.\nA few hours later the drumming of a downpour on the roof broke through my dreams. My eyes flew open to stare out the window into the semi-darkness. There it was, the glint of a thousand raindrops against a streetlamp. A low rumble of Thunder rolled across the sky.\nI love sleeping to the sound of a distant thunderstorm and smiled in the darkness. Bitty Girl was sprawled next to me where she\u2019d settled herself after waking up chilly an hour before. I tucked her back in and relaxed in the rain-washed breeze.\nHe wasted no time and was curled up on my bedroom floor before I finished checking on Missy. She was still sleeping soundly. I decided to leave her as long as she was oblivious.\nJust as I drifted back to sleep, another flash of lightening and clap of thunder jolted me awake. I knew that proximity to lightning.\nA second flash confirmed my prediction. The fan fell silent and the world was plunged into blackness.\nThrough the cracked bedroom door, I watched a dim glow appear, fade, then grow brighter.\nMy mommy-brain told her to shush, grabbed my phone and fumbled for the flashlight app as I leaped out of bed to confront whatever horrifying creature was entering my bedroom.\nThe door slowly opened emitting a soft gust of air.\nI shook my head impatiently at my stupidity and calmly stepped into the living room and shined my light around. I smiled at the sight of my father-in-law holding a candle and my mother-in-law right behind him with a handful more.\n\u201cWould you like a candle?\u201d He offered me a tiny glowing dish with a cheery smile.\n\u201cSure! Thank you.\u201d There is always something warm and comforting about that little dancing flame.\nI carried it to the bathroom counter where it cast a cozy glow that extended into the bedroom.\nI traversed the darkness again to check on Missy and smiled to see her peaceful face, eyes still closed in oblivion. I was tempted to wake her up and carry her into the bedroom so I could avoid another trip through the dark house (how many times had I tripped across the Lego bucket in the living room in a single night?), but she showed no signs of being disturbed.\nBack in the big bedroom, one son was smoothing his pallet, and the other was nowhere to be seen. Bitty\u2019s faint snores floated from the big bed. I crawled onto Bug\u2019s bed and found his feet, then his head, sprawled width-wise across the mattress with the duvet pulled up over his head. I pulled the cover back, and two big dark eyes stared right into mine. He giggled and sat up.\nBoth boys were wide awake from the booming thunder, so we curled up on my bed and conversed in hushed tones about the storm. I reminisced about living in a metal-roofed trailer when I was ten and described to my own boys the noise that would ensue every time we\u2019d have a thunderstorm, which happened on a regular basis in southwest Missouri.\nThey asked about flash floods, and we discussed dams and man-made lakes until I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes open. The noise of the thunder was moving away, and I shooed the boys back to bed to finish out the night.\nMy eyes opened lazily in the dim morning light. I could still hear the steady drumming and dripping of rain on the roof and trees and rushing through gutters.\nPans rattled and spoons clanked in the kitchen. Tea time, only this morning it had to be done the old-fashioned way: boiling water on the stove. Thank goodness for a gas cooktop on mornings when the electric kettle is deprived of power.\nNow I\u2019m sitting cross-legged in the middle of the floor with my computer perched on my lap and a steaming mug of Chai tea, my fingers keeping time with the dripping rain outside the open window. The light bulbs are all asleep, and the appliances are eerily silent. I anticipate a day of books, games, and tea as the gadgets hibernate, and the rain gauge and creeks fill.\nI love it when I randomly decide to check your blog and there\u2019s a post to read!"

The look of terror and desperation cracked apart between a wide smile. His face remained flush. Jimmy knew the blood was gushing somewhere else. The underwear slid down his sheened legs. Connie, her naked flesh glistening in the glow of the ancient lights.\nJimmy smiled wryly, slinking back into the bed. She moved her hands under the covers, making sure that he was ready to carry on. As her hand touched him, his smile opened. He was ready, and in a few brief, intense minutes the passion was out of them both as they sunk again into the mattress. The pocketed springs gave a last, long groan, and the couple finally fell into a happy, relieved slumber.\nIt was but a brief respite. Outside, the hazy sky filled with thunder and a storm buffeted the construction of the house. The spittle of rain on the clouded-up bedroom window became steadily more intense, more regular.\nIt also hid the sound of the lock clicking, padded footsteps pacing in through the bedroom door and the steady scrape of sharpened metal on the treads of the staircase.\nIn quick succession: THWACK! THWACK! THWACK!\nConnie quickly gasped. She shuddered, suddenly feeling a chill. Her eyes opened, and she saw the rain on the window. The frame was rattling in the wind. She took a breath, beginning to sit up. Rubbing her eyes, her ears now focused on the sound outside the door.\nHe murmured again, and sleepily gestured her away. As if to say not right now.\n\u201cYes, now!\u201d she hissed, her foot finding his leg. He shook, then got up out of bed. He found the door handle in the darkness. The handle rattled but didn\u2019t move. There was an electrical buzzing and, as he noticed the lights in the room had extinguished, his head turned.\nBefore Connie could answer, the bedroom door seemed to fall open by itself. Jimmy\u2019s head turned, and, with a grunt of surprise, he saw Mrs. Chaldean, standing in the doorway.\nConnie laughed as Jimmy retrieved his clothes from the heap on the floor. He stood up, just as a muffled but distinct voice came through the door.\nJimmy didn\u2019t answer. He stared at Connie. His eyes returned to Mrs. Chaldean. In the gloom b y her legs, a black plastic sack, like those used for rubbish, flapped and crackled. Their gaze met. Jimmy said nothing about the sack.\nSome low, light thuds echoed through the building as Mrs. Chaldean climbed the stairwell to the third floor, where her quarters were. Jimmy, breathless, looked to Connie. He climbed back into the bed.\n\u201cWe\u2019re out of here by eight tomorrow, alright?\u201d He growled. His eyes rolled to upstairs, as he heard a wheeze of a mattress, much quieter than the racket that Jimmy and Connie had connived to bring about. Then silence.\nJimmy gave a sceptical glance to the room, as if he could see something in the darkness, but shook his head. He felt drowsy and the pillows on the bed next to Connie looked much more inviting now.\nFinally, it seemed that the ghosts that lurked the corridors of Holman Hall would let their guests slumber. Jimmy slipped into the bed. The sheets crinkled. He felt Connie\u2019s warmth close by, and a hand wandered from his side toward hers, tenting the linen subtly, then meeting the taut flesh. She hummed, and he hummed too, taking a deep breath of her essence.\nEyes closed, Jimmy smiled, and his tented hands fell flat on Connie\u2019s thigh, and wandered further in a well-rehearsed dance of the five fingers. He took another deep breath, about to make the final flourish of his act, but the breath stirred him in a way he didn\u2019t expect. In the dark his eyes screwed up and his naked shoulders rolled restlessly. He withdrew, feeling a tingling sensation in the back of his mind. Somehow, his eyes open now and glistening, he felt he was being observed by a force of powers unimaginable.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Connie murmured, feeling the disturbance in the bed and the removal of Jimmy\u2019s hand.\nHe waved, making a noncommittal noise, and let the drowsiness descend onto his dewy eyes, and fell into a perturbed, slumber, his arms like those of plastic figurines, cast closely to his self. They stayed there, stiff and immobile, all night.\nA cold draft rattled the loose window frame again. It roused Connie. She\u2019d been awake for a good while already but maintaining the pretence of sleep with closed eyes. Maybe this strange house would melt into her familiar surroundings if she wished it hard enough?\nShe opened her eyes after the rattling carried across the room. She took a shallow breath. Cold stale air. Connie sat up, and the chill caught her skin, bringing out goosepimples on her naked breasts as the duvet fell with the same raspy sound that had kept her awake with every subconscious movement.\nNext to her, Jimmy murmured incomprehensibly as he stirred, his eyes opening slowly. He smiled, seeing her sitting in bed, gazing sleepily across the top of her goose pimpled frontage.\nBefore she could reply, there was a clatter outside and the door to the room flung open. Quickly, Connie wrenched the cover up. Mrs Chaldean leant in.\n\u201cSix-thirty, loves. About time you young things were up and out of that bed, I should think!\u201d Mrs. Chaldean trilled, drawing the door closed with a muffled thump.\nConnie threw the bedcovers off, despite the coldness that brought up her skin like a Christmas turkey. She looked out of the window, seeing sunshine in the sky but not feeling any of its warmth. Turning back, she saw Jimmy propped up in the bed.\nJimmy finished dressing by pulling on a cardigan from the bottom of his backpack over his shoulders and opened the door. \u201cLadies first,\u201d he said playfully. Connie, despite her scorn, couldn\u2019t fail to smile, just a tiny bit.\nThe dining room looked brighter than it did the night before, and as the couple trooped down the staircase, the sound of clattering cutlery against porcelain grew steadily louder, and the warm scent of a cooked breakfast wafted, meeting Jimmy and Connie midway down. They paused for a moment, savouring it.\nJimmy did so, but Connie paused for a moment. Her eyes were drawn to the locked door of the reception room. In the morning sun the hallway was full of motes of hanging dust, disturbed only by the passage of the two guests toward the dining room. Her gaze on the door was broken only by the rattling of the dining room handle under Jimmy\u2019s hands. Shaking her head, she followed.\n\u201cTwo, what do you\u2026\u201d he began to protest, but felt a pain bolting across his shin. He corrected course quickly, for the second time in as many minutes.\n\u201cYes, lets,\u201d the landlady replied with a sigh. The conversation petered out, replaced with the sounds of breakfast being eaten.\nAs they ate, Mrs. Chaldean excused herself. The kitchen door clattered closed. Pulling back her shawl, she checked the watch on her withered wrist. Wordlessly she acknowledged the tiny movement, then made a tiny movement herself, gliding across to the sideboard by the door. The register opened under the lightest of touches, the pages flittering past, propelled by a mystical kind of hurry.\n\u201cLet\u2019s change that, shall we?\u201d Mrs. Chaldean hummed to herself. \u201cPut that right.\u201d She crossed the latest two entries in the register."

                            "text": "The man inside lived a hermit's life. He enjoyed his solitude, rarely venturing beyond his guardian lions and never imposing a word upon those living around him. After enduring many grueling years as a journalistic prisoner of war, he had grown mistrustful of strangers and preferred to keep a safe distance at all costs. Not a superstitious man, he was unbothered by the melancholy fa\u00e7ade of this home, and found charm in the oddities that distinguished it from the other neatly manicured landscapes around. In fact, they played an instrumental role in his self-imposed isolation from the rest of society.\nThe decrepit house was his only inheritance from his mother, who passed away during his time in an underground cell. He returned to the house in its sorry state, and rather than waste his pension on its upkeep, he embraced its weathered character for his new life. An ambitious soldier turned hardened writer, he was able to work from the comfort of his overstuffed, wing-backed chair, basking in the warmth of the grand fireplace of his study more often than not, only venturing outside to deposit the occasional brown-paper parcel in the box on his fence containing his pseudonym works for his editor.\nOne night, after a glass of neat scotch and another chapter finished in his current project, the man ascended his winding staircase and retired to his bedroom for the night. As he lay in his bed, he was tormented by sleep that refused to last, tossing and turning between dreamy haze and frustrated consciousness. Rolling over once more, he heard a creak in the wooden floor coming from downstairs. He dismissed it quickly, and pulled the blankets up closer to his face.\nHe rolled over to face the door, eyes open now, heart beating a little faster in breathless anxiety waiting for another sound. Silence lingered for what felt like an hour, and just as he started to close his eyes, a whining creak cut through the night as something from below was approaching up the staircase.\nHis heart began to pound in his chest as he rapidly contemplated his next move. He had no weapon in here, and although the hero in many of his works would have bravely thrown open the door to face whatever trespasser made the mistake of disturbing his sleep, the thought of this confrontation made his stomach churn. Another dull thud on the staircase below. It was climbing towards him, one agonizingly slow step at a time.\nAs quietly as he could, he slithered out of bed and crept towards his door. Firmly pressing one hand against it, the other gripped the lock and turned it slowly until the soft click cut through the silence like a discarded bullet casing. He held his breath, praying that somehow he was unheard. His heart thudded in his chest like it was trying to break free from his ribs. A soft thud emanated from the landing. It had reached his floor.\nA scratching sound like nails riding along the wooden floor slowly got louder and louder as it approached his room. Behind his locked door he was paralyzed with fear, sweat beading from his forehead as his blood turned to ice. The scratching stopped just on the other side of his only protection from whatever was stalking him.\nHe heard a soft exhale almost as if the intruder was breathing against his door. And then silence. Was it just a breeze? Maybe his imagination was getting the better of him... the glass of scotch too generous, perhaps. He lived in an old house after all, there were bound to be loose floorboards with generations of mice beneath causing his hazy imagination to run wild. The present silence echoed loudly throughout the halls.\nHe shook his head and began to relax when he heard what sounded like claws scraping down his wooden door. The sound made his heart leap to his throat as it raced futilely away from the approaching evil. Turning around, he dove headfirst under his bed, desperately trying to escape his tormentor. From under the bed he could see black shadows beyond the small crack below the door. He closed his eyes, praying that whatever was about to happen, it would be over quickly and he could leave this nightmare behind for good.\nAfter what felt like an eternity, he squinted open his eyes and looked out to the space beneath the door. The shadow was gone, and he could see a sliver of moonlight shining through the landing window beyond. His heartbeat slowed, and he climbed out from beneath his mattress to stare blankly at the door before him.\nWas it too soon to check?\nHe decided it was, and buried himself under the covers of his four-poster bed. The intruder could steal whatever it wants, just so long as it left him alone. Wrapped tightly in a cocoon of blankets, he stared at the door wide awake, waiting until the safety of daylight to venture out into his home.\nAs fresh sunlight cascaded through his windows and filled his bedroom with a warm energy, a new sense of confidence arose in him. He got out of bed and unlocked his door, pausing at the handle to take a deep breath before flinging it open.\nNo scratch marks on the door. No trail on the floorboards in the foyer. He went downstairs to find all of his windows closed and locked as they normally were, his front door the same. There was no way someone could have entered his home without a key, and he knew this was impossible. Last night\u2019s episode must have merely been an elaborate tangent his imagination concocted after a little too much scotch and not enough sleep. There was no other explanation.\nHis day passed like any other, and before he knew it the sun was slowly fading into twilight, leaving the sky a deep crimson with streaks of purple clouds like curtains about to unveil the evening\u2019s show of twinkling lights. As he sat by his fire, a worn novel in his lap and petite glass of brandy on the table beside him, the exhaustion from his previous night\u2019s episode started to set in, and he felt his mind drift as sleep cradled him in its arms.\nThere was a knock at the front door, and he jolted upright, very awake. He never had visitors. He got up and walked through the hall to the foyer, but hesitated. Maybe he was just hearing things again like last night.\nThe knock repeated. He pressed his face against the door, looking through the peephole to see a woman draped in a hooded black robe that extended the full length of her frame to lightly brush against the porch with the gentle breeze. He considered her for a moment, then turned back the padlock and pulled up the floor stopper to open the door and face his uninvited guest.\nUpon first glance, what he could see of her face seemed slightly gaunt, with wispy strands of black hair lightly concealing her left eye and poking out around the sides of her neck. Her right eye was opened wide as if in a state of permanent surprise, the deep brown pupil dilated to a thin disk. Her nose was crooked as if it had been broken and not healed correctly, her lips the color of distressed mahogany. His gut told him to slam the door shut and just walk away, but there was an indescribable, strangely familiar aura about her that entranced him, keeping his feet glued to the worn wooden entryway.\n\u201cCan I help you?\u201d His voice shaking slightly, betraying his attempt at confidence.\nHe looked past her and saw no car parked outside his gates. A dense fog hung over the dimly lit street, blanketing most of the neighboring homes. This woman was unfamiliar to him, but he was sure the Esthers lived in the house at the opposite end of the development.\nShe stared at him blankly for a moment.\nAlthough he rarely ventured outside the safety of his walls, he felt inexplicably reluctant about sending her on her way alone. Of course, she was only a stranger and just moments ago he wanted nothing more than to retreat into the safety of his home behind the thick wooden door and wait for whoever this was to pass on. But slowly replacing his dread, a sense of passive tranquility began coursing through his veins. He was helpless to its spell.\n\"I\u2026 I'll get my shoes.\"\nHe held open the door as she stepped inside, black cloak dragging across the welcome mat through the entrance way as he silently led her to the study. He left her by the fire as he walked to the foyer closet. He bent to pick up his loafers and turned back to the entrance of the study to find her silently staring at him.\nShe was standing on one foot, the other raised beneath her cloak with her knee protruding slightly. Her arms were extended high above her head, with her hands drooped so they formed two claws. The sagging black arms of her cloak had fallen below her elbows, revealing angry violet and black scars streaking across both of her forearms.\nShe met his gaze silently, as lightning outside flashed through the window, casting an elongated demonic shadow across the floor in her wake. His skin started to prickle, and he felt an uneasy quell in his stomach. His mouth fell open in shock as she slowly inched closer to him, her one foot still in the air beneath the cloak while the other dragged at the ground in a piercing screech, like iron nails grinding against the wood.\nHe turned ghostly sallow as he recognized the sound from the night before. His shoes dropped to the floor from his trembling hand. Turning away from her, he bolted across the foyer to his back kitchen, scrambling up the narrow service staircase at its rear to the second floor. He took refuge in his bedroom and locked the door shut behind him without hesitation. He grabbed the telephone and after a brief ring, he was connected to the local police station.\nHe slammed the phone onto its receiver and turned back to the door straining to hear any sounds of movement. He heard the same familiar scratching noise against the wooden floor, and soft thud as she reached the first rise on the staircase. Heart beating out of his chest, he dove underneath the bed for lack of a better plan.\nCreaking footsteps approached toward his bedroom up the stairs and finally reaching the landing. He heard again the familiar dragging scratch across the wood floor leading toward his hideout, until she reached the door. Reliving the horror of the previous night amplified by a thousand, he jerked his gaze away from the door as he heard her softly exhale before scratching her nails down his door.\nSuddenly, the scratching stopped and there was a deafening silence. He glanced to the space under the door, and saw no shadow waiting behind his wooden shield. He heard no footsteps or any movement from the hallway. Crawling on his hands and knees toward the door, he pressed his face against the crack below to gain a better view of the suspiciously deserted hallway.\nCarefully he rolled back the lock and opened his bedroom door. The landing was clear as he walked slowly towards the master staircase, peering over the railing to gaze at the entranceway below. His home appeared abandoned again. He walked down the stairs, and approached his front windows in time to see a cloaked figure gliding down his street. Suddenly filled with an unfamiliar courage, he opened the door and lightly jogged out after her.\nHe had to stop her from getting to the Esther home. Not that he knew these people at all, but no one deserved the fright she had given him now twice. Whatever her motive, he wouldn\u2019t be pushed around anymore. As he moved through the fog-laden street, he saw her approach the house at the far opposite of his own, ascend the porch stairs and let herself in through the unlocked front door. He followed across the front lawn of the Esther house, and approached the living room window to peer inside. All he saw was darkness, save for a light coming from the second floor.\nHe glanced to the ajar front door and thought for a moment before slowly entering. The cops would be right behind him, he reassured himself, as he stepped into a stranger\u2019s home to chase after the specter that terrorized him the past two days. He inched toward the staircase and the light emanating from the floor above.\nNo answer. He carefully climbed the stairs and glanced across the upper hallway to the light coming behind another door left ajar.\nStill no answer. He walked to the door and lightly pushed it open. Nothing could have prepared him for the sight that greeted him as he stepped through the doorway.\nLying on a blood-soaked bed was the body of a woman-the woman that visited his home on two separate occasions. She was naked and there were deep slashes across her chest, her arms tied to the bedposts behind her head, hands dropped downward to form crude claws. Her right foot was twisted grotesquely, as if she had tried and failed to escape prior to the horrors that followed.\nHe became lightheaded and felt bile rise in the back of his throat. Pale and sweating, he ran down the stairs and out the open front door to land sprawling on the neatly kept lawn. He retched uncontrollably, tears streaming down his face, in complete shock of what he had just seen. A high-pitched ringing filled his ears and blocked out the sound of everything around him. Red and blue lights flashed on the ground before him as two police cars pulled up in front of the sinful house.\nShivering and feeling trapped in some distant nightmare, he felt himself being pulled to his feet as a blanket draped across his shoulders. A uniformed man walked him away from the house and the horror within towards the cruiser, speaking inaudibly to him over the persistent ringing in his ears. He climbed numbly in the back seat, and watched the Esther house steadily fade to black as he was ushered away into the foggy darkness."

Getting drunk?\nShe yanked me upright, threw the beer can somewhere, dragged me to her beat-up old car and threw me inside. She drove to a trailer park on the other side of town, where it floods twice a year, and dragged me to her beat-up old trailer and threw me inside.\nI need a drink. Just you stay there. I ain't going to hit yer, yet.\nSome time later the empty bottle and several cans lay on the floor.\nWher'yer get those clothes from? You get dressed in a charity shop?\nShe ripped my clothes off and threw them somewhere and me on the bed.\nWomen look more attractive at night, especially after a few drinks or with no clothes \u2013 but not this one. The bed was hard and uncomfortable. The only soft thing on it was me. She threw herself on me.\nOK Honey-Baby! Do what you got married for! Get on with it!\nI did what I was told. She slept on me. I watched the moon move slowly across the sky through the dirty windows without curtains. The TV was on. The wind blew, the trailer rocked and sometimes empty cans and bottle rolled across the floor.\nI don't drink anything before breakfast.\nBreakfast came out of a bottle.\nI'm going down to the welfare office to get your money and food coupons. Just stay here until I'm back.\nWhere was I going without clothes? I looked about the trailer. Anything that was thrown on the floor was lost forever, I decided. Clearing up was impossible. The TV had no off switch. In the little kitchen was a flame, a gas flame, perhaps she cooked with it. There was also a refrigerator filled with beer; perhaps it threw cans of beer at me when I needed them.\nShe staggered in with a big cardboard box full of bottles and cans. She threw it on the table.\nShe grabbed some cans and a bottle and disappeared into the tiny kitchen. I could hear her throwing the cans at the wall; perhaps that was her way of opening them.\nShe threw a bowl of something on the table and whomped big shovelfuls of it onto two plates. I expected her to call it chow, I had no name for it, certainly not food.\nOh, I need a drink.\nShe grabbed a bottle and I caught a flying can of beer.\nHere! I've got somin nice for you.\nShe threw a check shirt, a pair of jeans and some boots at me. I got dressed.\nOh, yeah! You look good in that. Time for another drink.\nThe days went by. The drinking and the sleeping. Once a week she went down town and brought back cans of peas and corned beef, never beer, and the necessary bottles.\nThe heaps of bottles, cans and other stuff remained but never got bigger. I think that the trailer recycled all that stuff into cans of beer which found their way into the refrigerator. I was never short of a beer, there was always one, freshly thrown, on the table.\nOne night she got real angry with me, it could not have been what I'd said, I never said nothing. She threw bottles at me. She tried to kick me but missed. She threw empty cans at me, at least they didn't hurt.\nWhen I woke up my head hurt bad. It was wet, salty wet. There was broken glass in my hair.\nI watched her come out the kitchen with a can of corned beef. She put it on the table, opened it, cut the stuff into cubes and ate them with a fork.\nWhat was wrong? Why had she not thrown it on the table, like usual? Why did she not eat it with her fingers, like usual? Why did she not shout at me, like usual? Why could she not see me?\nI waited until my strength came back and staggered out of the trailer. She did not see me go.\nYou think that I know women. How can that be? I am only a man named b."

Florida may be known for its sunshine to many, but those of us who really know Florida, know the truth. The truth is that she does what she wants, and she likes giving us rain!\nIt's true, our eyes in the sky really see some gorgeous sites and we love flying! Yet, sometimes our flying conditions are not ideal, and can even be scary. Flying in our fixed wing planes and sometimes a helo (helicopter) can be intimidating when facing a storm.\nColette, the president of Aerial Innovations, mused about her terrifying experience one day. She had gone out flying as usual that day, but on their way back from the shoot she noticed the skies. The clouds had started to form across the skies, casting an eerie feeling within the cabin. As it began to grow darker, her pilot joked about it being no big deal and faced these clouds head-on. Mistake!\nAfter diving into the clouds, the plane rattled, Colette screamed, and the pilot veered away and around the storm cloud. Even though he was bickering about how they were perfectly safe and avoiding the storm was wasting airtime, Colette put her foot down, and that pilot obeyed. To this day, she doesn't regret her decision to avoid that storm.\nOur pilots are trained to avoid lightening, so if it's spotted, we're high-tailing it out of there! On one flight, Robert, one of our photographers, experienced this first hand. They were on their way to Daytona to take some aerial shots for one of our clients when the storm hit.\nThey weren't even halfway done yet, but lightning was spotted and the pilot insisted that they turn around.

Nothing was trashed or overgrown and graffiti wasn't sprayed across the crisp wood walls.\nBut, something didn't feel right. A heavy foreboding hung in the warm air.\nIt was like gazing at a historic battlefield. The wildflowers and green rolling hills are lovely, but at one time, it cradled the blood and bones of hundreds.\nThe rain is sporadic and the humid air cooled by soft breeze on Koh Chang. My best friend Desiree and I had been staying on Lonely beach for a couple of days and quickly became rooted to life on this quiet island in the Gulf of Thailand. It's one of those places that feeds your sins in a way that renders not an ounce of guilt or regret.\nAn island of secrets and hushed whispers, this is a tropical paradise where the moon is worshiped with howls; where the poi dancers aren't local entertainers, but sorcerers of orange heat and blue magic, scorched skin and ember eyes. They watch like a predator watches its prey; arrogant grins as they paint the night sky with swirling flames. On Koh Chang, you dance with the devil late into the night and never leave.\nDes and I had stumbled upon a bizarre discovery while exploring the island on scooters one day. A dirt road had brought us to a deserted beach and bay. It was a picture out of a luxury travel magazine, complete with a wide stretch of crunchy pink sand and mop-topped palms. A small inlet had been cut out of the bay to make an aquatic parking space. It's inhabitant was a monstrous floating cruise ship. We pulled over and stared at the curious thing for awhile. We had stumbled upon a flying saucer of the sea, crash landed upon the island of Koh Chang.\nIt looked as if the abandoned ship had been turned into a floating hotel of horrors. The afternoon storm clouds rolled in, bringing out the black slime that blanketed its drab white walls like leprosy. The towering body was pock-marked with dozens of dark cabin room windows. I rested my eyes upon each pane, half expecting a ghostly face to stare at us from one of them.\nBut no one else was here on this beach. This pristine beach scarred by this spooky vessel. Only the lonely palms swayed like dancing slaves around its dominating figure as the wind began to pick up.\nInside, the quiet stillness was not expected and the air smelled of old wood. An unfamiliar electricity clung to the hairs of our bodies. The decor was dated yet modest, dusty yet protected from the harsh tropical weather due to the ship's dense exterior. A reception desk greeted us and long narrow hallways ran down either side. The corridors were dark save for a milky bright light at the end of each outstretched hall; cabin doors casting shadows in the eerie interbreeding of light and dark.\nWe ascended the staircase to a higher deck with cat-like steps, pretending to be invisible to whoever was watching from the shadows. We stepped into one of the hallways that tunneled the length of the room like a stretched spine, and the unearthly feeling intensified. I shook the brass knob of one locked door after another, daring one to open, and said suddenly, \"Let's go back downstairs.\"\nBelow the initial reception area we had entered through, there was a room. It was dirty and the bowels of the ship had been breached by the air here. Windows were salt slicked and a depressed moan seemed to echo as the wind shook its bones and black waves stung its hull. We decided it was time to leave.\nAs we headed towards our escape, what stood out in magnificent splendor was the most divine Spirit House I had ever seen.\nSpirit Houses are found throughout Southeast Asia. In Thailand, you will see them perched outside any and every establishment, from the most prominent skyscraper in Bangkok to the small village or the forests and mountains. These ornate structures resembling houses or temples represent the ancient spirit worship and rituals that have survived for centuries. The purpose of a Spirit House it to provide shelter and appease spirits that have remained on the earth, in a particular place.\nA Brahm priest skilled in astrology, chanting and Hindu rituals is the master of this age old tradition. They also communicate with the spirits. The Brahm priest uses his wisdom to choose the proper location, cardinal position, height, and color of a spirit house. The overall construction and the offerings of various foods, drinks, statues and the burning of incense reflect the whims of the spirit that has been invited to stay.\nThis particular Spirit House stood boldly on a sturdy dias, placed in its own quiet nook of the ship. Shimmering with brilliant mosaic glass pieces and slick gold paint, the grand palace glowed; picking up any trace of sunlight and reflecting the intricate details of the palace roof and windows.It was a valiant shield lifted against the discomfort of this bizarre ship. There were neat glasses of water with straws and plates of sweet smelling blossoms and snacks. Not a speck of dust was found on the spirit house, in fact, it looked as if it was the one object in this place that radiated life and color.\nWhen we arrived back at Lonely Beach, Desiree and I couldn't stop thinking about that creepy ship. The few locals we asked seemed reluctant to speak about it. As Des Googled furiously on her phone, I asked the Thai woman whom we had rented the scooters some questions. Why was such a beautiful beach so desolate, why the ship?\nShe didn't smile and there was a slight trace of fear in her voice.\n\"People have died there. Someone jumped from the roof and the hotel closed,\" she murmured, as her eyes darted and she busied her hands. \"It only opens during high season if every other hotel on the island is full.\"\n*Note: We were told that there had been deaths, but I couldn't find any sources to back up the claim. Regardless, this place is scary and weird. If you enjoy exploring abandoned places- the ghost ship and its beautiful hidden beach will captivate you."

                            "text": "How and why some of my work is made.\nDuring the late nineties and early teens, I collaborated with another artist, Heidi Zednik. We\u2019d met when we were both in residence at Dorland Mountain Art Colony. I had the entire run of a second floor studio \u2013 one half was my living quarters, the other my studio. Heidi was in residence as a writer \u2013 her cabin was dark, damp and cramped. Dorland is an odd place, where spontaneous socializing with others is discouraged, or so it was at the time. On a parcel of land deeded to the Nature Conservancy, Dorland was mostly off-grid; communications with the off-site world were done via a pay-phone located in a small room directly below my rooms. Each night I heard a woman\u2019s voice, talking on that phone into the night. Her voice was a modulating hum, her words indistinguishable. Often I fell asleep listening to the sound of her voice.\nAbout a week into our month long residency, there was a violent storm. I opened the door and three of the colony cats scurried in. After fighting to get the door closed again, the cats and I sat hunched on my bed \u2013 I had never experienced a storm like this, living as I had in land-locked Colorado. By first light the storm had passed. I went outside and saw evidence of the storm everywhere I looked. A large oak, uprooted by the wind, had blown down in the parking lot, landing on two of the vehicles parked there. As we residents stood around gawping at the damage, the social protocols of Dorland were set aside and I met Heidi, the woman whose voice I\u2019d heard talking into the night.\nSo started my afternoon walks with Heidi. We meandered through nearby orange groves, the air heavy with citrus perfume, our walks often ending with a cup of tea in her dark writers cabin. As our time at Dorland neared its end, we agreed to meet up at other times, in other geographies. We considered various collaborative projects, then tossed them aside.\nHeidi was traveling a lot; road trips across the country, a move back to her homeland, Austria, then settling in Asheville, North Carolina, where she purchased and improved a historic family cabin, the builders and owners of the cabin the only prior occupants. Meanwhile I inherited the archive of my great Aunt Ruth \u2013 a treasure trove of photographs, paper ephemera and biological specimens dating back several generations. You can read more about the Ruth Wheeler archive here.\nIn the crawl space of Heidi\u2019s newly purchased but historic cabin were trunks filled with photographs, many of a man seated on a tricycle far too small for him, and bits of paper with lists of words. Heidi learned that this house, which had been in the same family for generations, was home to a differently abled fellow named Stanley. Stanley grew up and stayed in that house into adulthood. He loved wagons, tricycles and making word lists.\nHeidi lived in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina; I lived in the San Juan Mountains in Colorado. Having both come into a stockpile of ephemera around the same time, we struggled with wanting to use the ephemera but found it somehow too precious. Sharing the ephemera seemed like a way to begin. So we began mailing letters, photos, handwritten lists, old school notebooks etc. back and forth \u2013 each of us making our marks on these paper bits. We called this first collaborative project, which went on for several years, Notes from the Underground.\nThis phrase continues to resonate. In spring of 2018 I used it as basis for a double pamphlet structure I was experimenting with. This nine word sentence says enough \u2013 no need to embellish. So to flesh out the content of the book, I re-wrote the text in binary code. Here it is, page by page. It is now held by Special Collections at Topeka and Shawnee County Public Library."

                            "text": "This is a true account of a paranormal experience I had about twenty two years ago. One weekend, my sister asked my mother is she would look after her children while she and her husband went out for the evening. I went with my mother to help her, and drove us there. After they went out, my mother and I organised the children to bed , and sat down together to watch television in the living room. It was about nine thirty or ten at night.\nWe were watching television when my mother said, \u201cWhat\u2019s that noise.\u201d I said, \u201cI can\u2019t hear anything. What noise? I said it was the television.\u201d She said, \u201cNo, that noise, can\u2019t you hear it, it\u2019s getting louder.\u201d So, I did start to hear the noise she was talking about as it grew louder, and you could hear it a bit louder than the television. It sounded a bit like a house alarm, or fire alarm type of noise. But there wasn\u2019t any alarm going off in the house, and it wasn\u2019t coming from outside. The noise kept getting louder. I stood up and went into the kitchen to double check that it wasn\u2019t an alarm in the kitchen, or in the house. The noise grew louder and louder until it filled the house. My mum and I had to shout at the tops of our voices to hear each other. The noise was deafening.\nWorried about the children sleeping upstairs, I ran upstairs and checked in each bedroom. All were fast asleep. In my oldest nephew\u2019s bedroom, I tried to wake him. Gently nudging him , wondering why he and the others had not woken because of the noise. I looked at the curtain to the back garden. The curtains were shut so I could not see outside. I knew at the back of the house was empty farmers fields. I did not want to draw the curtains open in case I saw something that shouldn\u2019t be there. Instead I tried again to wake my nephew, but it wasn\u2019t possible to wake him up.\nI went to the stairs, and my mother was there on the top of the stairs. She shouted to me, \u201cI\u2019m going outside, I can\u2019t stand it.\u201d And she ran down the stairs. I ran after her, and caught her at the door, and stopped her opening it. \u201cNo\u201d, I shouted. \u201cStay inside. Don\u2019t go out.\u201d I had seen too many horror films to know that you never should go outside. And how could we go outside, and leave four children upstairs asleep, not knowing what was happening. I picked up the telephone, I couldn\u2019t hear the dialing tone because of the noise, but I dialed 999 for the police. And then held the phone up in the air so that if anyone answered they would hear the noise, and come. I dialled my brother\u2019s house as well and did the same.\nI didn\u2019t know what else to do. My mother and I held on to each other at the bottom of the stairs, and we kept looking around to see what was going on. Watching for anything unusual. There wasn\u2019t any thing to see in the house out of the ordinary. The noise filled the house, it was everywhere. Then the noise level went down, and stopped.\nWe were filled with relief, and emotion. There wasn\u2019t anything we could do. I made us both a cup of tea. And we waited for my sister and her husband to come back. They were very surprised at what we told them. But didn\u2019t believe that anything had really happened, because it could not be explained. There was no explanation to where the noise had come from in the house, there wasn\u2019t anything in the house to cause such a noise. Of course the police didn\u2019t come, and my brother, when later asked, said his telephone didn\u2019t ring. That week, I went to the next door neighbour to see it he had heard it, and he had not heard anything. The fact that it didn\u2019t wake up the children, is very strange as well. But my mother and I both heard the noise, and to this day, I cannot explain the cause of it."

After all, I didn\u2019t know who this Lorenzo Ortiz was.\nLet me just explain something real quick. It\u2019s just been me and my mom since I can remember. We live on a quiet island with a very low population, so, hardly anything like this happens. My mom grasped my hand tightly in her\u2019s and practically dragged me down into the basement. \u201cYou\u2019ll be safe here.\u201d She had smiled before turning to walk back upstairs. Part of me was confused. Was she just going to leave me there? That didn\u2019t seem to be the case as she returned with a bag full of food and multiple blankets and pillows.\nShe had persuaded me to lie down and, slowly, I fell asleep to her soft and gentle voice. It felt as if I had only been asleep for a few seconds when I opened my eyes again. My mother was fast asleep beside me, her face scrunching up here and there.\nNow that I was awake, I had come to the realisation that I needed the toilet, and badly. I thought about waking mom up, but, she looked so peaceful in her slumber and, besides, I was only going to be gone for a few moments and it\u2019s not like anything bad was going to happen, right?\nNo, not right. I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong.\nI moved quickly and quietly, slowly opening the basement door so it wouldn\u2019t make a sound. I hurried up the stairs and straight into the toilet. I did what I needed to do and moved back towards the staircase, when a soft voice made me freeze. It was deep and husky and it had come from my bedroom. I strained my ears, trying to listen to what the voice was saying.\nTaking a shaky breath, I began going down the stairs backwards, my eyes on the door the whole time. With each step, the voice got louder.\nI was so close to the basement door.\nIn a blink of an eye, the door had opened and my heart stopped as I saw him peek out of my room.\nHis eyes watched me, stormy grey irises that glowed in the night. A low growling noise could be heard and, before I bolted down the stairs and into the basement, I heard him hiss a single word.\nI didn\u2019t bother staying for a minute longer as I made sure the basement door was securely locked. I found my mother awake and she was hysterical to find the I had left without telling her. She was fussing over me, checking to make sure I was alright, but, I pushed her hands away to tell her a very important thing.\nMy mother\u2019s face went pale as I spoke these words.\nShe told me to wait in the basement while she went to look. She disappeared up the stairs and everything remain silent. As I type this out now, I can confirm that it\u2019s been about an hour and my mother still hasn\u2019t returned. I keep hearing the creaking of footsteps of someone walking about above me, but I\u2019m too scared to go and see what\u2019s going on."

One morning Arlene, while walking by the doorway of the parlor, started talking\u2014to whom she thought was me sitting in my favorite chair. I was in the study and heard her speaking. I shouted from the study, and she screamed, realizing she had just addressed a ghost. Another morning I came into the kitchen from the back door. I was working on the car and needed something from the cellar. As I breezed through the kitchen, I saw Arlene standing at the table out of the corner of my eye. I mentioned I needed something in the cellar. That was when I heard her hairdryer turn on upstairs. I looked back and there was no one in the kitchen.\nOne morning, a woman in a long black dress walked by my office door. We have seen her on several occasions in various rooms of the house. Late at night we will hear the chairs downstairs sliding as if someone is getting up from the dining room table. Items still move about the home with the aid of unseen hands, and guests are still prone to the ghosts\u2019 want for attention.\nLate one evening, Arlene and I were standing in the kitchen when our dog Robbie gave out a loud howl and made a dash for the parlor. We looked in his direction and saw a dark figure walking across the room. We both followed at Robbie\u2019s heels, but the figure was gone. Robbie had just chased a ghost.\nOn many occasions we see someone walk up to the door of the front porch. The dark figure appears to knock on the door\u2014then vanishes.\nOne day I was outside feeding our bunnies when a man repairing an overhead next door asked, \u201cYou still have ghosts?\u201d At first I thought he may have read an article on the house, but then, upon closer inspection, I realized it was Mr. Grinold, the man who sold us the house. He related how many of his workers walked off the job because of the strange activity that took place while they were renovating the house. Workers would put tools down right beside them and they would vanish from under their noses, only to be found later in an unexpected place. Workers would often hear footsteps coming up the stairs when no one was there. Many times they could see the staircase and hear the creaking of the stairs, but no physical body was there to cause the noise.\nNeighbors occasionally stopped by telling us they saw the ghosts of former owners on the second floor balcony or looking out the windows. One of our neighbors knocked on the back door one afternoon and saw, as plain as day, a small man and a child in the kitchen. He ran back and told his wife who already knew of Putnam\u2019s most haunted house. This is the same man and child we have witnessed over the years.\nA woman came over one day telling us that she grew up in the house and often sat on the stairs at night for fear of staying in her room. Her room was our present bedroom, and she often saw a woman dressed in an old style nurse\u2019s uniform standing at the foot of her bed.\nWe researched the history of the home and found the place was at one time a convalescent home for the mentally ill. Several other former residents came forth and shared their experiences with us. One was witness to a little girl that would appear in the bedroom at the end of the second hall. This is where our overnight guests have heard the giggling and sounds of a child while sleeping in that room. Another visitor related that there was once a barn in the backyard that he used to play in. The barn was torn down when two women hanged themselves in it at the same time.\nThese are but a scant few incidents. There are many, many more that occurred and still do occur as you read this. They are not violent or malicious as much as they are \u201cin want\u201d to simply be part of the home they loved in life."

The door itself had been built right into the mountain face, if they hadn\u2019t known where it was they\u2019d have gone right past it. Even now knowing where it was Sam found it difficult to make out the seams of the door. It had been a four hour drive from the nearest town, though calling it a town was being generous. Population of only four hundred and as they drove through it seemed like every damned one of them was watching them. Behind him he heard a click, \u201cwe\u2019re in!\u201d Sam turned to see the door already open, the large slab of rock moved easily and Sam saw that he\u2019d gotten the dimensions of the door wrong. Ted stepped inside the door and reached around for a second, \u201chere it is.\u201d he flicked the three switches in the correct order as he turned the last one a light came on above him revealing a metal staircase that lead downwards.\nThey stood at the bottom of the staircase, Sam didn\u2019t like it, he could feel the weight of the mountain pressing down above them, just waiting to trap them down here forever. Ted was working on the second door, which was based on a coded question and answer system. It didn\u2019t take him long to type in the answers and the door popped open revealing the vault.\nThere was a bright flash of light and an attractive young woman stood in the middle of the room. She had long blonde hair, bright red lips, smoky eyes and breasts that looked uncomfortably large.\nBehind them the door swung shut.\nSam left the sitting room and went into the kitchen, the place was supposed to be well stocked, at the very least there should be some booze squirrelled away somewhere. Probably some drugs too, rich people wouldn\u2019t cut themselves off from their supply, it was just a matter of finding it. He quickly found a bottle of rum, he twisted off the cap and took three big swallows, feeling it burn his throat and stomach, before he started coughing. Eyes watering he took another swig. If he was going to end up dying here he wasn\u2019t going to do that sober.\nThis entry was posted in Sci-Fi, Short Stories and tagged creative writing, fiction, final, free, job, robbery, science fiction, short story.

                            "text": "The man inside lived a hermit's life. He enjoyed his solitude, rarely venturing beyond his guardian lions and never imposing a word upon those living around him. After enduring many grueling years as a journalistic prisoner of war, he had grown mistrustful of strangers and preferred to keep a safe distance at all costs. Not a superstitious man, he was unbothered by the melancholy fa\u00e7ade of this home, and found charm in the oddities that distinguished it from the other neatly manicured landscapes around. In fact, they played an instrumental role in his self-imposed isolation from the rest of society.\nThe decrepit house was his only inheritance from his mother, who passed away during his time in an underground cell. He returned to the house in its sorry state, and rather than waste his pension on its upkeep, he embraced its weathered character for his new life. An ambitious soldier turned hardened writer, he was able to work from the comfort of his overstuffed, wing-backed chair, basking in the warmth of the grand fireplace of his study more often than not, only venturing outside to deposit the occasional brown-paper parcel in the box on his fence containing his pseudonym works for his editor.\nOne night, after a glass of neat scotch and another chapter finished in his current project, the man ascended his winding staircase and retired to his bedroom for the night. As he lay in his bed, he was tormented by sleep that refused to last, tossing and turning between dreamy haze and frustrated consciousness. Rolling over once more, he heard a creak in the wooden floor coming from downstairs. He dismissed it quickly, and pulled the blankets up closer to his face.\nHe rolled over to face the door, eyes open now, heart beating a little faster in breathless anxiety waiting for another sound. Silence lingered for what felt like an hour, and just as he started to close his eyes, a whining creak cut through the night as something from below was approaching up the staircase.\nHis heart began to pound in his chest as he rapidly contemplated his next move. He had no weapon in here, and although the hero in many of his works would have bravely thrown open the door to face whatever trespasser made the mistake of disturbing his sleep, the thought of this confrontation made his stomach churn. Another dull thud on the staircase below. It was climbing towards him, one agonizingly slow step at a time.\nAs quietly as he could, he slithered out of bed and crept towards his door. Firmly pressing one hand against it, the other gripped the lock and turned it slowly until the soft click cut through the silence like a discarded bullet casing. He held his breath, praying that somehow he was unheard. His heart thudded in his chest like it was trying to break free from his ribs. A soft thud emanated from the landing. It had reached his floor.\nA scratching sound like nails riding along the wooden floor slowly got louder and louder as it approached his room. Behind his locked door he was paralyzed with fear, sweat beading from his forehead as his blood turned to ice. The scratching stopped just on the other side of his only protection from whatever was stalking him.\nHe heard a soft exhale almost as if the intruder was breathing against his door. And then silence. Was it just a breeze? Maybe his imagination was getting the better of him... the glass of scotch too generous, perhaps. He lived in an old house after all, there were bound to be loose floorboards with generations of mice beneath causing his hazy imagination to run wild. The present silence echoed loudly throughout the halls.\nHe shook his head and began to relax when he heard what sounded like claws scraping down his wooden door. The sound made his heart leap to his throat as it raced futilely away from the approaching evil. Turning around, he dove headfirst under his bed, desperately trying to escape his tormentor. From under the bed he could see black shadows beyond the small crack below the door. He closed his eyes, praying that whatever was about to happen, it would be over quickly and he could leave this nightmare behind for good.\nAfter what felt like an eternity, he squinted open his eyes and looked out to the space beneath the door. The shadow was gone, and he could see a sliver of moonlight shining through the landing window beyond. His heartbeat slowed, and he climbed out from beneath his mattress to stare blankly at the door before him.\nWas it too soon to check?\nHe decided it was, and buried himself under the covers of his four-poster bed. The intruder could steal whatever it wants, just so long as it left him alone. Wrapped tightly in a cocoon of blankets, he stared at the door wide awake, waiting until the safety of daylight to venture out into his home.\nAs fresh sunlight cascaded through his windows and filled his bedroom with a warm energy, a new sense of confidence arose in him. He got out of bed and unlocked his door, pausing at the handle to take a deep breath before flinging it open.\nNo scratch marks on the door. No trail on the floorboards in the foyer. He went downstairs to find all of his windows closed and locked as they normally were, his front door the same. There was no way someone could have entered his home without a key, and he knew this was impossible. Last night\u2019s episode must have merely been an elaborate tangent his imagination concocted after a little too much scotch and not enough sleep. There was no other explanation.\nHis day passed like any other, and before he knew it the sun was slowly fading into twilight, leaving the sky a deep crimson with streaks of purple clouds like curtains about to unveil the evening\u2019s show of twinkling lights. As he sat by his fire, a worn novel in his lap and petite glass of brandy on the table beside him, the exhaustion from his previous night\u2019s episode started to set in, and he felt his mind drift as sleep cradled him in its arms.\nThere was a knock at the front door, and he jolted upright, very awake. He never had visitors. He got up and walked through the hall to the foyer, but hesitated. Maybe he was just hearing things again like last night.\nThe knock repeated. He pressed his face against the door, looking through the peephole to see a woman draped in a hooded black robe that extended the full length of her frame to lightly brush against the porch with the gentle breeze. He considered her for a moment, then turned back the padlock and pulled up the floor stopper to open the door and face his uninvited guest.\nUpon first glance, what he could see of her face seemed slightly gaunt, with wispy strands of black hair lightly concealing her left eye and poking out around the sides of her neck. Her right eye was opened wide as if in a state of permanent surprise, the deep brown pupil dilated to a thin disk. Her nose was crooked as if it had been broken and not healed correctly, her lips the color of distressed mahogany. His gut told him to slam the door shut and just walk away, but there was an indescribable, strangely familiar aura about her that entranced him, keeping his feet glued to the worn wooden entryway.\n\u201cCan I help you?\u201d His voice shaking slightly, betraying his attempt at confidence.\nHe looked past her and saw no car parked outside his gates. A dense fog hung over the dimly lit street, blanketing most of the neighboring homes. This woman was unfamiliar to him, but he was sure the Esthers lived in the house at the opposite end of the development.\nShe stared at him blankly for a moment.\nAlthough he rarely ventured outside the safety of his walls, he felt inexplicably reluctant about sending her on her way alone. Of course, she was only a stranger and just moments ago he wanted nothing more than to retreat into the safety of his home behind the thick wooden door and wait for whoever this was to pass on. But slowly replacing his dread, a sense of passive tranquility began coursing through his veins. He was helpless to its spell.\n\"I\u2026 I'll get my shoes.\"\nHe held open the door as she stepped inside, black cloak dragging across the welcome mat through the entrance way as he silently led her to the study. He left her by the fire as he walked to the foyer closet. He bent to pick up his loafers and turned back to the entrance of the study to find her silently staring at him.\nShe was standing on one foot, the other raised beneath her cloak with her knee protruding slightly. Her arms were extended high above her head, with her hands drooped so they formed two claws. The sagging black arms of her cloak had fallen below her elbows, revealing angry violet and black scars streaking across both of her forearms.\nShe met his gaze silently, as lightning outside flashed through the window, casting an elongated demonic shadow across the floor in her wake. His skin started to prickle, and he felt an uneasy quell in his stomach. His mouth fell open in shock as she slowly inched closer to him, her one foot still in the air beneath the cloak while the other dragged at the ground in a piercing screech, like iron nails grinding against the wood.\nHe turned ghostly sallow as he recognized the sound from the night before. His shoes dropped to the floor from his trembling hand. Turning away from her, he bolted across the foyer to his back kitchen, scrambling up the narrow service staircase at its rear to the second floor. He took refuge in his bedroom and locked the door shut behind him without hesitation. He grabbed the telephone and after a brief ring, he was connected to the local police station.\nHe slammed the phone onto its receiver and turned back to the door straining to hear any sounds of movement. He heard the same familiar scratching noise against the wooden floor, and soft thud as she reached the first rise on the staircase. Heart beating out of his chest, he dove underneath the bed for lack of a better plan.\nCreaking footsteps approached toward his bedroom up the stairs and finally reaching the landing. He heard again the familiar dragging scratch across the wood floor leading toward his hideout, until she reached the door. Reliving the horror of the previous night amplified by a thousand, he jerked his gaze away from the door as he heard her softly exhale before scratching her nails down his door.\nSuddenly, the scratching stopped and there was a deafening silence. He glanced to the space under the door, and saw no shadow waiting behind his wooden shield. He heard no footsteps or any movement from the hallway. Crawling on his hands and knees toward the door, he pressed his face against the crack below to gain a better view of the suspiciously deserted hallway.\nCarefully he rolled back the lock and opened his bedroom door. The landing was clear as he walked slowly towards the master staircase, peering over the railing to gaze at the entranceway below. His home appeared abandoned again. He walked down the stairs, and approached his front windows in time to see a cloaked figure gliding down his street. Suddenly filled with an unfamiliar courage, he opened the door and lightly jogged out after her.\nHe had to stop her from getting to the Esther home. Not that he knew these people at all, but no one deserved the fright she had given him now twice. Whatever her motive, he wouldn\u2019t be pushed around anymore. As he moved through the fog-laden street, he saw her approach the house at the far opposite of his own, ascend the porch stairs and let herself in through the unlocked front door. He followed across the front lawn of the Esther house, and approached the living room window to peer inside. All he saw was darkness, save for a light coming from the second floor.\nHe glanced to the ajar front door and thought for a moment before slowly entering. The cops would be right behind him, he reassured himself, as he stepped into a stranger\u2019s home to chase after the specter that terrorized him the past two days. He inched toward the staircase and the light emanating from the floor above.\nNo answer. He carefully climbed the stairs and glanced across the upper hallway to the light coming behind another door left ajar.\nStill no answer. He walked to the door and lightly pushed it open. Nothing could have prepared him for the sight that greeted him as he stepped through the doorway.\nLying on a blood-soaked bed was the body of a woman-the woman that visited his home on two separate occasions. She was naked and there were deep slashes across her chest, her arms tied to the bedposts behind her head, hands dropped downward to form crude claws. Her right foot was twisted grotesquely, as if she had tried and failed to escape prior to the horrors that followed.\nHe became lightheaded and felt bile rise in the back of his throat. Pale and sweating, he ran down the stairs and out the open front door to land sprawling on the neatly kept lawn. He retched uncontrollably, tears streaming down his face, in complete shock of what he had just seen. A high-pitched ringing filled his ears and blocked out the sound of everything around him. Red and blue lights flashed on the ground before him as two police cars pulled up in front of the sinful house.\nShivering and feeling trapped in some distant nightmare, he felt himself being pulled to his feet as a blanket draped across his shoulders. A uniformed man walked him away from the house and the horror within towards the cruiser, speaking inaudibly to him over the persistent ringing in his ears. He climbed numbly in the back seat, and watched the Esther house steadily fade to black as he was ushered away into the foggy darkness."

                            "text": "Natasha groaned as she awoke to the sound of her phone buzzing against her headboard. Her forehead throbbed with pain while nausea engulfed her stomach. She smacked her dry lips and felt overpowered by thirst.\nNatasha opened her bloodshot eyes and sat up.\nNatasha got out of bed and walked over to her flimsy desk in her small, ramshackle bedroom. The beer cans that covered the floor clanked against each other as she shuffled through them. A few pieces of acid blotter paper sat on the desk next to her old, outdated laptop. She considered taking one, but decided it would be best to not show up at the client\u2019s home tripping.\nNatasha knocked on the woodgrain-patterned door inside the condo complex. It was so solid and heavy that it hurt her knuckles.\nThe door opened a few moments later to reveal a petite woman with auburn hair standing in the doorway. She wore grey suit pants, a white short-sleeved button up shirt, and black pumps. Natasha felt underdressed in her plain black t-shirt, jeans, and tennis shoes.\nThe woman looked her up and down with an expression of mild surprise. \u201cYou\u2019re the psychic?\u201d she said.\nNatasha noticed several finger-shaped bruises on the underside of Serena\u2019s right arm. She glanced at her other arm as she walked past her into the condo\u2019s living room and saw similar bruises there as well.\nThe condo had posh hardwood floors, chrome-plated fixtures and luxurious art deco furniture. Framed artwork of various sizes and styles covered the white-painted walls. There was a large portrait of Serena in a wedding dress embracing a man in a tuxedo as a centerpiece. The far wall consisted of plate glass windows revealing a panoramic view of the city\u2019s skyline.\nAs Natasha looked around, she noticed a stack of papers including what appeared to be several bills on an end table. Each one had phrases such as \u201cPAST DUE\u201d and \u201cFINAL NOTICE\u201d stamped upon them in big red block letters.\n\u201cYou have a beautiful home,\u201d she said.\nTears began to stream down Serena\u2019s face.\nSerena started to cry, then she turned around and buried her face into her hands. Natasha shuffled her feet and swung her arms in awkward discomfort.\nA buzzing sound came from Serena\u2019s pocket. She reached into it and took out her phone, then typed in her code to unlock it. Natasha saw the code over her shoulder and memorized it. Serena wiped the tears from her eyes as she looked at the screen.\nSerena plugged her phone into its charger and set it down on a nearby table. Then she walked down the hallway adjoining the living room and into her office.\nThe sound of typing came down the hallway, and Natasha scurried over to the phone and used the code to unlock it. She scrolled through Serena\u2019s emails and saw they were all work-related. She kept scrolling until she found one with a subject line that said, \u201cRE: I think I have a problem.\u201d The email was a month old and came from a person named Miranda Johnson. She opened it.\nI understand your concern, but I think you\u2019re overreacting. Just because Michael has been working late a lot these days doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s seeing other women. You work late all the time too, don\u2019t you? I\u2019ll call you tonight and we can talk about it some more, ok?\nThe sound of typing stopped. Natasha closed the email app and turned off the screen, then put the phone back down on the table. She hurried over to the other side of the condo and found the door to the bedroom. Inside was a king-sized bed with white pillows and a fluffy white duvet. Another door to a darkened room stood open next to it.\nShe walked into the bedroom and through the doorway. Feeling around on the wall, she found a light switch and flipped it on. The light revealed that she was in the bathroom. White tiles covered the floor, and the smell of bleach stung her nostrils. An oversized, pearl-white bathtub sat in the corner. She went over to it and looked inside.\nWhen she did, the lights turned off and the door slammed shut.\nA strange blue light filled the room. Natasha looked behind her and saw that it came from the bathroom mirror. In the glass, she saw a man and a woman standing next to each other. She realized that the woman was Serena and the man was the one she\u2019d seen in the portrait in the living room.\nThere was a knock at the door and the lights turned back on. Natasha looked at the door, then back at the mirror. When she did, she saw nothing but her own reflection staring back at her.\nNatasha opened the door and found Serena standing there with a concerned look on her face.\nSerena frowned. Tears pooled in her eyes as she hugged herself, running her hands over the bruises on her arms. \u201cSo, it\u2019s true. He was cheating on me,\u201d she said.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Natasha said in a hoarse whisper.\n\u201cWould it help if you saw the radio he dropped into the tub?\nSerena pointed at a clock radio sitting on top of a dresser next to the bed. Its digital display showed the correct time.\nShe walked over to the dresser and picked up the radio to examine it. When she turned it over, she saw that it didn\u2019t have a power cord. It ran on batteries.\nNatasha turned around and saw that Serena was gone. In her place stood a bizarre, humanoid creature with long, greasy black hair. Yellow-brown, finger-shaped splotches like bruises covered its skin. Its misshapen limbs ended in sharp talons, and its eyes were white without pupils or irises. It opened its mouth to reveal rows of sharp, needle-like teeth. Natasha gasped and dropped the radio."

Cynthia looked at Sam and then at the house. They were stranded, but the house didn\u2019t seem like an option she should take.\nThe house stood a few feet off the road. It stood tall, casting an imposing shadow on the trees that stood to its right.\nLightning struck and lit up the house for a second. Cynthia grabbed onto Sam\u2019s hand. The vines that curled round the house scared her.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the feel of this place,\u201d Cynthia said.\nSam looked at her and saw the fear in her eyes. He smiled.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to fear,\u201d he replied. He tried to assure her that she was safe.\nThe last house they saw was more than four miles back and the road ahead looked deserted. Their only shelter from the rain was in the house they now stared at.\nSam dragged the bags as he continued toward the house. Cynthia tagged along unwillingly. In the house, a light appeared at the top window. It lingered for a minute, and then it disappeared.\n\u201cSomeone is home,\u201d Sam said.\nCynthia looked at Sam, then at the house and back at Sam. The light appeared by the window a second time, and Sam could see the frame of a woman. He tried to wave at her, but the light disappeared again.\nThe stairs creaked as Sam and Cynthia climbed to the front door. Sam knocked on the door while Cynthia looked around them.\nBy the northern side of the house, Cynthia saw a swing move up and down as if someone sat on it. Lightning struck and Cynthia saw a child on the swing. The child stared at her.\nThe door swung open, and Cynthia turned to see a woman standing by it. She stood, holding a lamp in her hand and staring at them. Her hair was gray, and her left eye was a mass ball of white tissue. Cynthia stared at the woman. The woman smiled coldly, revealing a set of brown teeth.\n\u201cWelcome to Half Souls Inn,\u201d the woman announced.\nShe shifted to her side, giving Cynthia and Sam room to walk in. Cynthia looked back at the swing but couldn\u2019t find it. The swing was gone. In its place was a pool of water. Cynthia stared at it in fear. She failed to notice time pass.\nSam called Cynthia a second time before she realized they were waiting for her. The woman stared at her calmly. Cynthia looked at Sam, then at the road. The rain was becoming heavy. She hesitated for a moment, then sighed and stepped into the house. The woman closed the door.\nInside the house, the woman walked with them to the desk that stood by the stairs. The interior of the house looked a bit pretty. Sam looked at Cynthia and smiled. She smiled back weakly. The woman explained that their electricity supply had a little problem but would soon be fixed. Sam had no problem with that. He just needed a place to rest his head and change into some dry clothes. By morning of the next day, they would be on their way home.\nCynthia looked around her. Lamps hung on the walls and up the stairs. Underneath each lamp, she saw the portrait of people hanging in frames. Beside her, Sam reached into his pocket and drew out his wallet. He fished inside it for the amount required and paid the woman. As the woman handed the key to Sam, Cynthia saw the people in the picture look at them.\n\u201cOh God!\u201d Cynthia gasped, as she turned towards Sam, grabbing his arm. The woman stared at her coldly. Cynthia wanted to get out of the house, but Sam would not move.\n\u201cCome on, it was just the light casting shadows,\u201d Sam said as they climbed the stairs.\nThe woman walked before them, as she escorted them to their room. Behind her, Cynthia tried to control her fear.\nAt their door, the woman asked if they would need anything. Sam said they were fine. The woman nodded in understanding, and then descended the stairs.\nSam gently closed the door and turned to look at the room. The room didn\u2019t look bad. Aside the bed, there was a table by the wall and a lamp on it. The bed was well made and the sheets were clean. Cynthia stood by the wall, with her arms wrapped around her. Sam smiled at her. With time, she would see that there is nothing to fear.\nCynthia saw that Sam\u2019s mind was made up. She walked towards the bathroom, to take a look at it, while Sam threw the bag on the bed and opened it.\nCynthia rushed out of the bathroom as Sam closed the door and descended the stairs. She walked to the door and pulled it open. She was not going to stay alone in the room.\nInstead of the stairs, a brick wall stood before Cynthia. She stepped back into the room, looking around her. A portrait hung on the wall, by the bed. The woman in it stared directly at her. Cynthia stepped to her right and watched the woman\u2019s stare move with her. Terrified, she walked backwards, further into the room. The woman still stared at her.\nCynthia stopped. Someone stood behind her. On her shoulder, a drop of blood fell, followed by two more. She slowly turned around.\nHer terrified scream never left her lips. Cynthia fell to the ground, a pile of charred flesh. On the stairs, a new painting appeared with Cynthia\u2019s face on it.\nDownstairs, Sam stood confused. The reception hall was no more. He stood in a hallway longer than the house could possibly accommodate. Down the hallway, a baby cried from one of the rooms within the house.\n\u201cHello!\u201d Sam called as he walked down the hallway, toward the cry.\nAlong the hallway, Sam found vacant rooms with open doors and blood stained walls. The cry of the baby became louder. He got to the room and found it open too. Inside the room, a woman attended to the baby. She turned and stared at Sam coldly. Sam apologized for intruding and almost turned back into the hallway. He noticed blood drip down the woman\u2019s neck and looked closely.\n\u201cIs everything alright,\u201d Sam asked as he stepped into the room. A chair stood in his way. He bent down and shifted it to the side, then stood erect to look at the woman. The woman and the baby were gone.\nSam walked further into the room, confused. He turned back towards the door and gasped. The woman stood before him, with the baby in her arms. The door slammed shut. Sam looked at the door, then at her. She looked up from the baby to Sam\u2019s face and smiled coldly.\nThe lamp in the room went off.\nFictafic is a freelance writer who lives in Lagos, Nigeria.

                            "text": "Jack settled into his seat and stared out the window. The plane was only about half full and due to the late departure time most everyone would be sleeping, everyone except Jack.\nHe watched solemnly as the city lights disappeared and he felt the plane level off at cruising altitude. The attendant brought him a drink and he tossed it down then asked for another. She smiled and trotted away, returning a few moments later with his request.\nSam. What the hell was she thinking? Did she really expect him to play this stupid \"follow the leader\" game without a fight? What had she twisted up in that super brain of hers that could possibly rationalize their separation? She loved him. He knew that to be fact, had known it for years. Why was she suddenly ready to throw that away? His mind searched but found no answers, refusing to believe he was going to lose her over a command decision, he changed tactics.\nMaybe it was him. Had he done something to make her doubt their relationship, his commitment? His mind played back her last visit. Everything had seemed great to him then, of course they hadn't really talked about work. They'd been so glad to be together that the subject just hadn't come up. Her happiness had been genuine, her smile warm and real. He would have known if she was hiding something, wouldn't he? They'd spent their days in bed, at the park, had taken in a movie and even had dinner with a mutual friend that was stationed temporarily in Washington. Nothing out of the ordinary and so he had assumed the argument was finally over - settled, history. He hadn't mentioned SG1 and neither had she.\nJack poured his second drink and swirled the liquid mindlessly around the glass. Experience told him that Sam had all the answers although she might not share them with him. She could be as closed off as he could and he didn't look forward to battling it out with her, but he would if it came to that. He wasn't going to just walk away - not this time. She was worth fighting for. But first, he'd try talking. He wasn't very good at that and words often failed him, but he'd try. Maybe he should just demand an answer. He deserved that much and it wasn't like Sam to be unfair. And leaving him now, without any explanation would be incredibly unfair.\nHe checked his ticket for arrival time and grimaced slightly as he realized there was a stop in Dallas to change planes. This wasn't an Airforce jet that would streak across the skies nonstop and reach the base in a few hours. It would be a long flight, but it would still get him home. Suddenly he was very tired. He should try to sleep.\nHe struggled in the small space, trying to stretch his legs, trying to find a comfortable position. Finally, he shifted his mind into combat mode, the one that allowed him to sleep anywhere, the one that allowed his physical machine to rejuvenate and his mind to rest even though part of him remained ready and alert. He laid his head back against the seat, ignoring the discomfort and concentrated on sleep. Suddenly the air around him stirred slightly and he grasped the hand on his shoulder almost before it touched him. The young attendant jumped, startled by his sudden movement. Jack looked up into surprised green eyes and smiled as he released her arm.\n\"That's all right, I'm sorry to startle you. The captain saw you come aboard, Sir and wondered if you would like to move into first class. There's plenty of room, General and you'll be more comfortable there.\"\nJack looked at his knees pressed against the seat back and started to stand. \"That would be nice, thank you.\"\nHe settled in and a few minutes later fell into a dreamless sleep, exhausted from his work and the added stress of trying to solve a problem he didn't really understand.\nIt was 0500 before he reached the house. It was dark, almost foreboding as he stood outside staring at the darkened windows. A light snow drifted silently to earth around him and the brisk air felt refreshing against his face. He was tired. Even in first class, it had been a long flight and for the first time that he could remember he wasn't excited to be home. He wasn't even sure it was home anymore and although he didn't want to admit it, that scared him.\nHe stepped quietly onto the porch and slipped his key into the lock. A small sigh of relief escaped him as the key turned easily unlocking the door and dispelling the barely recognized fear that she might have changed the locks. At least she hadn't taken that step yet, hadn't barred him from her life completely.\nHe moved down the hallway and pushed gently against the bedroom door where Sam was sleeping. The house felt warm, comforting and he smiled as his eyes fell on her relaxed form. She was wearing a little pink strappy tank top and shorts, resting on her stomach with one leg peeking out from beneath the covers. Her arms were wrapped around the pillow, as she cradled it against her head, her face relaxed and her tousled hair falling randomly across her face.\nShe was tired, exhausted, otherwise he would never be able to sneak up on her like this. Oh, she slept soundly when she was home, a direct opposition to her sleep on missions, but still aware and waking at the slightest sound. He fought against the urge to brush the hair from her face and kiss her cheek, finally stepping silently into the bathroom.\nHe brushed his teeth and undressed, hanging his uniform haphazardly on the hooks on the door. She'd hate that, but it was the least of his worries, right now. He was tired and he needed her, his emotions were alternating between wanting to feel the comfort of her against him and dreading the rejection if she pushed him away. Those thoughts brought back the anger, the pain he'd experienced as he opened that damned envelope and he quickly forced it to the back of his mind, locking it away, if only temporarily. He was home. He'd fix it somehow, he'd do what he had to do to make it right again.\nWhen he returned to the bedroom she had turned on her side and her bare leg was now dangling over the edge of the bed, her arms free of the pillow and relaxed at her sides. He stopped short, taken aback by her innocent beauty. There was no sign of the brave soldier he knew her to be. That persona had slipped away, hidden in sleep, replaced by the beautiful creature that he loved so completely. His heart swelled in his chest as he watched her sleeping peacefully, totally unaware of his presence. Slowly he moved to the bed and gently lifted her leg, placing it back onto the bed as she moved slightly against his touch. He paused and smiled when she didn't awaken.\nWith all the stealth he could manage, he slipped into bed beside her, careful not to touch her or rouse her from sleep, hoping to avoid any confrontation until morning. He stretched out on his back and relaxed into the pillow as the comfort of the familiar bed caressed his body, then he closed his eyes waiting for the shelter of sleep to engulf him.\nHe was drifting away when he felt her stirring beside him. He pulled his mind back to consciousness as she turned and snuggled into his naked chest. Her arm moved around his waist, tugging slightly as he lifted his arm to make room for her and she nuzzled her face against his neck.\n\"Jack?\" She wasn't awake, but had sensed that he was there and in sleep sought the comfort of his embrace. He suddenly realized that his body had tensed up as she moved against him and shook his head slightly. How had they let this happen?\nPulling her against him slightly, he pressed a soft kiss on her forehead. \"It's me, baby. Go back to sleep.\"\nHer only response was to snuggle closer against him as he wrapped both arms comfortably around her and closed his eyes. She was in his arms. He was home. Everything else could wait until morning.\nA few hours later a warning signal triggered his brain and he was immediately awake. He lay still as his trained senses went on silent alert, still pretending to be asleep as he searched for whatever had awakened him. Suddenly he realized that Sam's hand was moving across his chest, her touch slow and gentle. When it stopped, he covered it with his own, squeezing gently and a slight smile tugging at his lips.\nHe opened his eyes, pressed his lips against hers softly and then smiled warmly. \"Morning. I live here, remember?\" He held up his left hand and wiggled his fingers, indicating the ring that rested there.\n\"No, Jack, you live in Washington. I live here.\"\nHe stared quietly at her for a moment. She was still lying in the crook of his arm, her body pressed against his and her head tilted back so that she could look into his eyes. \"That's only temporary, Sam. My home is wherever you are.\"\n\"I know you got the papers, Jack.\"\n\"Yeah. I got them.\" He looked down, away from her eyes, feeling pain and anger beginning to replace the thrill of waking up beside her.\nHe caught her eyes again before he spoke, making sure his voice was soft and free of the anger he felt.\n\"I think you owe me an explanation, Sam. What the hell is going on?\"\nShe was still lying against him, watching him closely, and she hadn't tried to pull away. He was reading a lot into that simple inaction. Sam wouldn't hesitate to push him away if she didn't want him to touch her. He pulled her slightly closer and allowed his hand to stroke the soft skin of her arm as he waited.\n\"It was simple enough that you served me with legal papers without even talking to me first. How complicated can it be?\" A bit of frustration slipped into his voice and he saw something flash across her eyes, something he didn't quite recognize. \"Sam?\"\nHe felt her hand press firmly against his chest and with one quick movement she was standing beside the bed.\n\"I have to go to work, Jack. Let's not do this.\"\n\"I'm not leaving until I know what's going on.\" His voice was still soft but Sam recognized the determination coloring it and knew he meant what he was saying.\n\"I have to shower and get dressed.\" She turned and walked out of the room, leaving Jack alone and more confused than ever.\nHe heard the spray of water as the shower came to life and pushed up from the bed, slowly standing to his feet. The room that had felt so warm last night, now felt a bit chilly and he wondered if that was because he'd just left his warm bed or was it the distance he could sense growing between himself and Sam. Running his hand through his hair, he crossed the room and pulled on a pair of sweats and a tee shirt. He glanced at the bathroom door, then at the clock on the nightstand and started down the hall to the kitchen.\nHe moved efficiently about the kitchen, making coffee, toast and eggs. He was almost finished when she appeared in the doorway.\nShe smiled slightly and moved to pour them both a cup, leaving his beside the pot as she moved to the table and sat down.\n\"You shouldn't have come here, Jack. I told you I needed more time.\"\n\"And I told you I was coming soon.\"\n\"That was three weeks ago.\" Jack stopped in mid-stride at the accusatory tone of her voice.\n\"I know baby, I'm sorry. It's hard to get away.\"\n\"But now, suddenly, you're here.\"\nConfusion filled his eyes. \"Sam, I always want to be here. You know that, don't you?\"\nShe looked down, wrapping both hands around the cup and pushing her chin forward. \"I'm not sure I know anything anymore. I can't get to Washington, you can't get home and...\"\n\"Everything just feels wrong, messed up...\"\nJack sat the pan back on the stove and moved towards her but she was already standing up to move away.\n\"Sam?\" She stopped and turned towards him. \"We talked about this. We promised not to go to sleep or walk out hurt and angry.\"\n\"I'm sorry, I have to get to work, Jack.\"\nHe followed her to the door watching as she pulled her jacket on and reached for the door. He didn't want her to just walk out like this but he didn't really know how to stop her.\n\"Sam!\" He almost yelled as his frustration overwhelmed him.\nShe turned towards him and was surprised at the pain reflected clearly in his dark eyes. She looked down and fiddled with the zipper of her jacket, knowing that she was hurting him and hating herself for it. Finally looking up again with a faint smile, she tried to lighten the situation.\n\"It's okay, Jack. I'm not hurt or mad.\"\nTurning quickly, she reached for the door but he stopped her, his hand covering hers as she grasped it.\n\"Sam?\" He paused, waiting for her to meet his eyes. He spoke slowly and distinctly, separating each word. \"I am.\"\nTheir eyes locked for a long moment and he could see a deep sadness that he'd never seen before and then the beginning of tears as she looked away.\n\"I'm sorry, Jack, I have to go!\"\nShe tugged the door open and went through it hurriedly. She didn't stop or look back, just climbed into her car and drove away.\nJack stood in the doorway staring after her and thinking that she was right, everything did feel wrong. Then he slammed the door forcefully and cursing softly, walked away."

                            "text": "Special Act - We're Getting Married!\nQueen Serenity was the queen of the Moon Kingdom during the Silver Millennium and the mother of Princess Serenity. She sacrificed her life by using the Silver Crystal to send the court of the Silver Millennium, including the spirits of her daughter, the Solar System Senshi, and her daughter's lover Prince Endymion, into the future to be reborn on Earth.\nShe described herself as being the incarnation of the Moon goddess Selene.\nIn the anime, Sailor Moon, Sailor Mercury, Sailor Mars, Sailor Jupiter, and Sailor Venus all ended up on the Moon when Kunzite attacked them at the North Pole with a dimension/temporal attack. Though they could have ended up in any random place or time, it seemed the Moon Stick guided them safely to the Moon. Once there, they found the ruins of the Moon Kingdom. They made contact with an image of Queen Serenity who explained the history of the Moon Kingdom and then sent the Sailor Senshi back to the Earth.\nAfter this, Queen Serenity appeared only once, in episode 51. Her spirit appeared in Usagi's subconscious mind after Usagi had been attacked by a Cardian. Serenity returned the Silver Crystal to Usagi, merging it with her Transformation Brooch (thus creating the Crystal Star), and also gave her the Cutie Moon Rod.\nIn the manga, when the Inner Senshi and Luna went to the Moon in Act 10, they went into the ruins of the palace, and there found the Holy Blade near the Crystal Tower, inside the Chamber of Prayer. When the sword was removed from the palace floor, the image of Queen Serenity appeared before them, saying that her essence resided in the computer databanks in the ruins of the Moon Kingdom, allowing her to speak with them. She told everyone that she was the one called Selene on Earth, goddess of the Moon, or former Queen of the Moon Kingdom, Serenity.\nShe told them all of the past, and how the people of the Moon had long lives, given to aid their mission to protect the Silver Crystal, while at the same time watching over Earth and guiding it on a good path. Queen Serenity told them of the machinations of Queen Metalia which had led to the downfall of the Earth, and the deaths of Prince Endymion and Princess Serenity.\nSerenity then told them that the dark power was reviving, because in her grief of losing her daughter, the seal she placed on Metalia was imperfect. She explained to Sailor Moon that she had to use the full power of the Silver Crystal to destroy the dark power; because the Crystal would follow her heart, she must believe in faith, unity, and love. Before she ran out of power, Queen Serenity told Sailor Moon to remember to live as a young woman because that was why she was reborn on Earth, and asked the other Senshi to protect Sailor Moon and to bring honor to the kingdom. She wished them happiness and her image faded away.\nFlashbacks in later story arcs revealed more about Queen Serenity's time ruling the Silver Millenium. She granted the respective planetary castles to Sailor Neptune, Sailor Uranus, and Sailor Pluto upon their birth. She likewise instructed Pluto on the responsibilities of her role as the guardian of space-time, informing her of the three taboos of her station: traveling through time, abandoning her post at the Space-Time Door, and stopping time.\nWhen they fought Queen Nehellenia, the Sailor Senshi learned that Queen Serenity first encountered her during the celebration of Princess Serenity's birth. Nehellenia had infiltrated the Moon, living deep within it, and though Serenity welcomed her so long as she sought peace, it was not to be. Nehellenia asked Serenity to join her instead, mentioning that they had both originated from a distant place, possibly meaning the Galaxy Cauldron. Queen Serenity used the power of the Silver Crystal to seal Nehellenia into her ornate mirror, within which the Queen of the Dead Moon dwelt until encountering the Sailor Senshi.\nAfter Eternal Sailor Moon saved the galaxy by resetting the Galaxy Cauldron and dispersing Chaos, Guardian Cosmos revealed that when Queen Serenity died, she returned to the Galaxy Cauldron.\nQueen Serenity's only appearance in the live-action series was in the Special Act. She first appeared when Luna called her to express concern that Usagi and Mamoru's relationship seemed to be falling apart. Queen Serenity assured Luna that things would be sure to work themselves out in due course, but warned her of a dark presence that was trying to awaken. She appeared again later, when Luna and Makoto were concerned about how to deal with the growing threat of Queen Mio. Queen Serenity sent them the Legendary Sword, which she called the Spirit of the Senshi, in order to revive the Senshi's powers.\nLike the live-action version of Princess Serenity, Queen Serenity did not wear the odango hairstyle. Her dress was different than that of her anime and manga counterparts, and unlike them, she also wore a crown. Queen Serenity only refered to Princess Serenity as \"the Princess\" and never as \"Serenity.\"\nIn the Sailor Moon musicals, Queen Serenity was played by Jaimie Natsuki, Yuka Kobayashi, and Mai Shiraishi.\nSerenity's name is derived from the Greek Moon goddess Selene, who fell in love with the mortal man Endymion. In Sailor Moon, the original Greek myth is divided between Queen Serenity (the goddess) and Princess Serenity (who fell in love with Endymion).\nIn the manga and anime, Queen Serenity wore her hair in exactly the same odango style as her daughter.\nAlthough Queen Serenity was blonde in her first anime appearance in episode 35, her hair was silver all of the other times she appeared.\nIn the opening sequence of the first five episodes of Sailor Moon Crystal, Queen Serenity had blonde hair and dark blue eyes, but as of the opening for Act 6 she appeared with white hair and grey eyes.\nDuring the Special Act, Queen Serenity was played by the same actress as Usagi Tsukino, although her voice was provided by Youko Soumi.\nIn the first English dub, Queen Serenity's first voice actress was the same person who played Serena's mother.\nAlthough Queen Serenity only appeared three times in the anime, she appeared four times in the English dub, because the dub inserted a flashback to the Silver Millennium in the first episode.\nThis page was last edited on 24 March 2019, at 14:01."

Tejaswinee Kelkar, and Alexander Refsum Jensenius present a paper on describing feature sets to compare melodic contours and people's tracings of them.\nContour features that compare to contour features of people's tracings of chosen melodies.\nPitch and spatial height are often associated when describing music. In this paper we present results from a sound-tracing study in which we investigate such sound--motion relationships. The subjects were asked to move as if they were creating the melodies they heard, and their motion was captured with an infra-red, marker-based camera system. The analysis is focused on calculating feature vectors typically used for melodic contour analysis. We use these features to compare melodic contour typologies with motion contour typologies. This is based on using proposed feature sets that were made for melodic contour similarity measurement. We apply these features to both the melodies and the motion contours to establish whether there is a correspondence between the two, and find the features that match the most. We find a relationship between vertical motion and pitch contour when evaluated through features rather than simply comparing contours."

Recent studies in cognitive neuroscience suggest that humans prefer objects with a curved contour compared with objects that have pointed features and a sharp-angled contour. An implicit perception of threat represented by sharp objects, in humans, was hypothesized to explain this bias. The study adopted a within-subject experimental design, where 36 subjects (representing three age-groups and both sexes) were exposed to a randomized order of 312 real-life images (objects, interiors, exteriors, landscape, and a set of control images). Amygdala activation was simultaneously captured using functional magnetic resonance imaging technology. Subjects\u2019 preference (like/dislike) data were also collected while in the scanner. Data were collected in 2013. In case of images depicting landscape and healthcare objects, brain scans show significant higher amygdala activation associated with sharp contours. However, in relation to images depicting hospital interiors and exterior envelops brain scans show significant higher amygdala activation associated with curve contours. These activations pertain to exposure during the precognitive stages of the subjects\u2019 perception. Conclusion: Hospital forms do have systematic impact on fear response during precognitive stages of human perception. Whether this first impression colors the subsequent experience of an actual patient with real illness or injury is unknown."

                            "text": "Do you Remember how we're going to caricature the woman to the right? About the only thing we're going to distort is the size of her mouth. Making her mouth smaller and pushing it up closer to her nose will make her nose look larger and make her chin look longer.\nWith the facial features pretty well placed, we'll now draw her chin and the sides of her head to enclose her face. After that, we'll tackle the hair and any finishing up we have to do.\nBasically, defining the size and shape of the head is done by drawing the chin first, then drawing the contour of one side of the jaw, then the other side of the jaw. Then define the hairline, and in defining the hairline, the forehead becomes the space between the hairline and the eyes. Finding where to draw these contours to define the face is pretty subjective in caricature, if you want to draw a really fat face, you put the contours of the face miles apart. If you want a skinny face, you'd put the facial contours really close to the outside edges of the eyes. Placing the lines is done by measuring where the contours actually fall on your subject using the facial features as marker for your measurements, then moving the facial contours around on your caricature to where you think they look good.\nDoesn't her chin look long already?\nLet's find where the chin will go. On the photo of the woman, with your pencil, measure from the bottom of her nose straight down to the bottom of her chin. If you take that measurement on the photo, and place one end of it horizontally at the outside corner of her left eye. Does that put the other end of the measure right about at the tear duct of her right eye? Yeah, I get that too. So on your drawing, measure from the right tear duct to the outside corner of the left eye. Turn that measure 90 degrees and put it at the bottom of the nose. See where the other end of the measurement falls, and lightly put a mark there. Now draw a curved line that represents the contour of her chin.\nNow we'll draw the sides of the head, and do the left side first. On the right side of her left eye, put a dot a bit less than half an eye away from her left eye. This is the edge of her head. Now, all you have to do is draw a curved line that follows the contour of her face from that dot to the chin line you just drew. Follow the contour of her face carefully. What you can do is go pretty much straight down, then when you get parallel with the mouth, start swinging the line in to meet the chin. For the right side the same process will work, let's start the contour line parallel to her right eye, and let's mark it at her hairline, which is much farther away from the eye than the other mark was. I see her hairline is about an eye width from the corner of her right eye. Do you see that? Since we want to make her chin look longer we should make her face narrower than it is. So, find her hairline at about an eye to the left of her right eye, then bring that measurement in a little bit to make her face narrow. Mark that point on your drawing. See in the image to the right where I originally put the mark, then moved it in. The right side contour is a steeper angle than the left side, then it gets really steep about parallel to the mouth. Draw this line pretty lightly because you may have to erase it and take another whack at it. I had to. When you draw the contours of the face, draw from the eye to the chin so you're drawing from top to bottom on your paper. Lines that are drawn down tend to be much smoother than ones that are drawn from bottom to top."

                            "text": "Draw an outside contour of the hair.\nOK, We'll start drawing the hair close to the face. In the photo, at the widow's peak, there's a lock of hair that creates an arched shape that falls to the right, that lock of hair continues down past her eyes. Parallel to her left eye, that lock of hair bows out and creates a dark shadow right at the facial contour. Draw a curved line starting at the widow's peak and draw it down along the contour of the face, bowing it out at the eye. Make some hints as to the direction of the hair with shapes made of grouped lines, and fill in the two darker spots with shadow and line. Don't worry about measuring the shapes in the hair to make them correct size, just eyeball the sizes you create with the lines and shadows. I'm sure she won't mind if her caricature ends up with big hair.\nTo the left of the right eye is another dark shape that encloses the ear. I keep drawing lines and shapes that follow the direction of the flow of the hair and I work my way up and around the top of the head and then work my way down the right side until I come to that large dark shape by the right ear.\nIn the photo, the right ear is concealed by hair and only the lobe and an earring are visible. Because the ear is barely there, you don't have to worry much about proper proportion for the ear. Just draw the earring, and shade the entire area all the way to the side of the face so you don't even have to draw an ear.\nWith the face mostly framed by hair, draw an outside contour of the hair that runs off the page. Draw a vertical line at her jaw representing the side of the neck. Continue and draw contours of the shirt she's wearing. Then all you'll have to do is finish drawing lines and shapes to represent shadows in the hair inside the hair contour.\nA little trick I do when drawing hair is not to draw shadow shapes all the way to the hair contour line. I leave a \"halo\" of blank space around the hair contour. This gives the illusion there's a light shining behind the head that highlights the hair. It gives the caricature a tiny bit of a \"photographic\" look. Of course, that's a little hard to do when you're drawing someone with lighter hair like our subject. I'll show you that trick later.\nYour assignment: Draw some caricatures of people with interesting hair. Concentrate on drawing that hair with as few lines as possible, but still make it interesting. Try drawing short hair, long hair, dark hair, and light hair."

Humming lightly as she walked along the straying near some of the larger boulders. The wind rustled through her wings, causing her hair be tussled about. Shivering slightly against the chilly breeze she pulled the coat around her tighter.\nMika wandered up the mountain like always. She stretched her wings out to the side stretching them. Something inside her wanting to take to the sky this afternoon. Singing softly she neared the peak of the mountain. She turned slightly glancing behind her down the mountain, before turning back making her way higher. Her wings twitching slightly.\nShe slowed her steps for a moment, thinking her had heard something. She stopped and listened for a moment. Pulling a shadow to her and letting it swirl around she tried to sense if there was someone there. After a moment she shook her head, figuring she was just paranoid. Loosing her wings she flew softly over the trail as she flew about the sky heading up to her favorite boulder. Enjoying the feel of the breeze today she continued humming.\nMika landed on her favorite boulder. Her wings twitching and settling down against her back. The wind settling through her feathers. She leaned back against the rock and sighed. She pulled her violin out of a shadow, and let her fingers play across the strings. A soft smile as she drew the bow across the strings and began to play.\nShe played for a while, the melody was melancholy, somewhere between dark and light. She was skilled with the instrument that was clear, treating it with respect. As the melody finally came to an end she sighed and leaned backwards. Sending the violin back to where she had grabbed it from she stood and stretched her arms to the air as her wings stretched out, before folding back delicately against her back. She walked to the edge of the mountain top, and stared off across the island.\nMika heard the rustle of something near to her. Far more on edge and quicker to react to things than the girl used to be, her sword materialized in her hand in a flash. Too many things had been happening, too many changes for her not to be on her guard. Still not wanting confrontation, but wary of noises when she was alone she looked in the direction of the sound and the movement. However she held her ground, neither advancing nor retreating. Shadows swirled around her free hand as if she was trying to sense what might be there.\nSeeing the rabbit hop out Mika let out a sigh. The shadows and sword disappeared. \"I think I'm overly paranoid. I guess I can't really be surprised.\" Laughing lightly she shook her head and walked closer to the rabbit. Leaning down gracefully, she extended her hand to the little creature. \"Hello there little one. Sorry if I frightened you.\"\nMika tilted her head lightly at the rabbit's reaction. She scratched behind it's ears lightly, sitting down next to it. She spoke in a soothing tone as to not scare the creature. \"Its okay little one. What are you doing up here all alone?\" She asked lightly, smiling softly."

                            "text": "Lee-a-lei's wide wings fluttered, casting pools of colored light that chased each other across the walls of the robotics laboratory. The harsh fluorescents from the ceiling softened to warm reds, golds, and chips of blue or green as they passed through her translucent wings.\n\"Are you sure?\" asked the roboticist, a human woman named Maradia. As she looked at the beautiful lepidopteran alien, a veritable stained glass window come to life, it was almost impossible to believe that she'd agreed to take this commission. She almost hoped that Lee-a-lei would change her mind and leave Maradia with a month of wasted work and a useless pair of mechanical wings.\nLee-a-lei's mouth parts stirred, and her long proboscis uncurled. The sounds she emitted were half flute, half violin. Yet Maradia could just make out the Solanese words, \"I'm sure. If I'd stayed among my own people, I'd have cut them off long ago.\"\n\"They're so beautiful,\" Maradia sighed.\n\"They're vestigial,\" Lee-a-lei intoned, holding out a knife with one of her six claw-like hands. \"Cut them off.\"\nReluctantly, Maradia reached out for the knife. Her human fingers brushed against the coarse hairs on Lee-a-lei's claw-hand. A pool of ruddy light fell on the knife blade. Maradia shuddered, but she did her job. She ran the sharp blade along the crease between Lee-a-lei's hard carapace and the soft flesh of her wing.\nThe blade came away gummy, and the wing crumpled to the floor like a discarded scarf. It twitched once. But Lee-a-lei didn't even flinch, merely stood by patiently while Maradia cut off the second one.\nLee-a-lei stood now before Maradia, strangely diminished. Her body hadn't changed, but the lack of her bounteous wings made it seem to have. Segmented arms and armor-like carapace, dozens of wiggly mouthparts nestled at the base of a long curled proboscis, and antennae that moved about restlessly above giant multi-faceted domed eyes -- that's all she was now. A monster who had been an angel. Maradia could see why Lee-a-lei had chosen to keep her wings so long after puberty while living in human society.\n\"Are you okay?\" Maradia asked.\n\"I feel... so light!\" Lee-a-lei twirled about, stretched out her segmented arms and danced like a nightmare come to life. \"If I'd known how good I'd feel without them, I'd have done this years ago.\"\n\"You still want the robotic ones, right?\"\nLee-a-lei hesitated, antennae rotating, and for a moment Maradia thought she might get stiffed on this job anyway. Then the former-butterfly alien said, \"Yes. Let's put them on.\"\nThis was the part Maradia was comfortable with: she lifted the pair of robotic wings, constructed from ultra-light alloys, and affixed them to Lee-a-lei's back. Smart wires wormed their way from the base of the mechanical wings into Lee-a-lei's carapace to bond with her nervous system. Little lights along the edges of the metal wings twinkled, showing they were operational.\n\"So pretty!\" Lee-a-lei exclaimed, sounding like a happy orchestra. She flapped her metal gray wings proudly; they were barely a quarter of the size of her old ones.\nMaradia looked down at the crumpled organic wings on the floor, still rich with vivid hues. As a roboticist, she was proud of the metal wings she'd made -- they were crammed full of clever devices like personal climate-adjusters, gyroscopic balancers, jetpack boosters, and limited anti-grav -- but they looked plain and gray in comparison to the ones discarded at her feet.\nThe metal wings were a common expression of Maradia's skill as a roboticist; Lee-a-lei's organic wings had been a marvel of biology.\n\"What do you want me to do with these?\" Maradia asked, shoving her foot against the folds of colors.\n\"Whatever you want,\" Lee-a-lei said. She was busy testing the anti-grav capability of her new wings -- hovering lightly over the floor. \"This is wonderful!\" she exclaimed. \"My old wings didn't let me fly at all!\"\n\"I'm glad you like them,\" Maradia said, wondering if the old wings could be preserved and turned into some sort of cloak. \"Come back in a couple weeks so I can give your new wings a tune-up, make sure they've bonded properly with your nervous system, that sort of thing.\"\nLee-a-lei's expression was hard to read, but her multi-faceted eyes sparkled. She paid double for her new wings, insisting that they were worth it, and left the laboratory an all new butterfly.\nMaradia picked up the old wings off of the floor, draped them over her shoulders, and tried to imagine feeling their lovely weight and warmth as a burden.\nMary E.

All you need to know is it\u2019s the prologue of my next novel trilogy.\nIt\u2019s high fantasy and I hope you like it!\nHigh Queen of Esnium \u2013 Prologue.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t make it to tomorrow\u2019s dinner I will stab you with a fork,\u201d Aster\u2019s mother threatened her. The woman\u2019s face was bright with laughter despite the threat and the tip of her nose was bright pink from the cold air.\nAster wondered what all the court members would say of their beloved High Queen if they saw her like that \u2013 dressed in flight pants and with her light hair pulled into a tight braid and not a single pearl on her. At that moment, the High Queen looked less like her normally noble and delicate self but more like\u2026 well Aster.\nAster\u2019s face was pink, and it wasn\u2019t simply because of the cold mountain air. She pulled her wings in close to her as she turned her back on both of her parents and walked over to the edge of the cliff.\nThe mountains where empty this time of year, when instead of soft green grass it was covered in stone hard ice. The sun was just starting to come up, and painted the sky bright greens and blues \u2013 the brightness of the colours contrasting with the white earth.\n\u201cHe\u2019s just kid,\u201d Aster moaned.\nAster\u2019s dad was quiet but Aster could picture him frowning. Her mother had a knack for knowing when things were about to go wrong, so her words seemed more like a warning then simply a request for help.\nAster turned to her parents again. They were the two most regal people she knew, and that meant quite something. Her father had great big purple wings, that marked him as High King but she had the feeling that even without the wings no one would be able to mistake him for anything less than noble. He stood tall and strong, his one arm around his wife\u2019s waist as he looked down at her with a slight frown.\nThe high Queen herself was looking right at Aster.\n\u201cCome on, please?\u201d she asked sweetly.\nAster knew that if she disagreed one more time, all the nice asking would vanish and her mother would still have her stuffed in a dress in time for the party. She still didn\u2019t want to go \u2013 the whole ball would be thrown in honour of her \u2013 the heir to the throne \u2013 and honestly she couldn\u2019t help but feel like it was wrong. The title wasn\u2019t meant for her.\nAster pulled in a deep breath at the sight of her mother\u2019s face and knew that she had lost.\n\u201cFine, I\u2019ll go,\u201d Aster said.\nThe queen started to grin and pulled out of her husband\u2019s embrace as she walked out to Aster, her arms outstretched.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be so much fun, you\u2019ll see. I have the perfect dress planned out for you\u201d The queen put her hands on Aster\u2019s shoulders.\nAster regretted her decision on the spot but caught her dad smiling at her. Their eyes met for a moment before he nodded his thanks.\nPerhaps if she did this, she might at least be useful as an heir.\nHer mum\u2019s hands went stiff on Aster\u2019s shoulders. Aster frowned at her and looked up to see her mum staring just past her into the open air.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Aster asked starting to turn around.\n\u201cWe need to get out of here,\u201d Aster\u2019s mum said pushing Aster away from the edge. Aster\u2019s dad caught on immediately and reached out for the two of them. He was too late.\nA great big arrow whizzed past Aster\u2019s head, missing her and her mother by a hair\u2019s breath. Aster was facing just the right direction to see it thump into her dad\u2019s chest.\nHer breath caught but she opened her mouth to scream anyway. Her dad \u2013 her king \u2013 stumbled back a step. Then fell.\nAster\u2019s mother pushed her backwards now, straight towards the edge of the cliff. The ground gave way beneath Aster\u2019s feet and finally the scream broke free of her lungs.\nAster screamed even as she flung open her wings. She screamed as she finally caught a glimpse of the giants standing on a nearby peak. She screamed as her mother spread her own multicoloured wings to slow their fall.\nTheir fall broke into a stumbling glide and they fell away from the attacking giants, as well as where they had left her dad.\nAnother arrow was fired and went straight through the queen\u2019s left wing.\nThe High Queen screamed in pain, and they fell the last bit.\nAster struck her head and stars filled her vision. She ignored it and scrambled out from beneath her mother. She managed to push herself onto her haunches before the world started to tilt. She balanced her footing even as she grabbed her mum by the arms.\nHer mum looked up at Aster, her eyes glazed slightly over, the traces of magic was clear in the queen\u2019s face. Aster had only seen this happen to her mum once before and her heart sank.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to make it,\u201d The queen said with certainty. Aster shook her head.\nShe pulled on her mother\u2019s arms one more time and managed to pull her mother into a sitting position. The whole world shifted at the movement. Aster stumbled and had to let go of her mum to steady herself.\nShe saw him then. A giant dressed in a fur coat stood not ten steps away from them, crossbow in hand.\n\u201cI already saw one of my children die,\u201d The queen whispered.\nAster\u2019s turned to her mum to warn her about the giant. It wasn\u2019t necessary.\nHer mother grabbed at Aster, her grip strong as she started to whisper.\n\u201cMum, no,\u201d Aster started but before she knew it darkness enveloped her. Cold stone closed around her and she opened her mouth to scream but the cold filled her mouth too. She tried to look for her mum, but the High queen was gone.\nThe Prologue of a story not yet completely planned out. Over the next few weeks, as I write the rough draft I will be giving you character stories, plot plans, world building secrets and of course pieces of writing like this one.\nDo you have any questions so far? Please don\u2019t be afraid to comment!\nNewbie lesson #1 \u2013 Planning out characters."

Her dad, Justice, was on the way to a Twins game with Liliana and her older brother when they passed by the Maya Moore \u2018Wings\u2019 billboard. Liliana was full of questions. Can girls play basketball too? Do they get to be on TV?\nJustice decided to change the family\u2019s plans, and took his kids to the Lynx game instead of the Twins. He posted a picture of Liliana in front of the billboard on Twitter, her arms stretched out to her sides: just like Maya.\nLiliana watched the game in the Target Center crowd. She heard the Lynx fans roar when Maya Moore came out to receive her ring, she witnessed the first game in the Lynx\u2019s defense of their 2017 championship. It was a great day, and that could have been the end of it.\nBut today, Liliana and her dad were treated to something even more special.\nLiliana was at Mayo Clinic Square today. She got a tour of the building, and after Lynx practice, she stopped in and was surprised by the real-life Maya Moore.\nThe moment when Liliana first saw Moore was a really special one. She looked at Maya, then back at her dad\u2014there was an instant recognition, she\u2019s the one from the poster!\nMoore spent some time with Liliana showing her a few basketball fundamentals. The pair dribbled, passed, and shot on the Lynx practice court. Though Liliana wasn\u2019t quite up to shooting on the full-sized hoop, Moore made a hoop out of her arms and Liliana swished it.\nThey posed together, arms outstretched, Liliana standing in front of Moore, just like in the picture that went viral last week. For Justice, it was quite a moment.\n\u201cThe anticipation coming up to it and then her reaction, I could just feel the tears coming. The way it panned out, it couldn\u2019t have panned out any better,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBeing able to see my daughter just kind of in awe of someone that plays at the highest level in the WNBA, and someone that is a proven success story, something that she can see and recognize for herself based on her own interpretation, then for her to look back at me and share that moment of, \u2018Dad you\u2019re here with me when I\u2019m seeing Maya Moore,\u2019\u2026 I could just feel the tears,\u201d Justice added.\nLiliana and her family will be in attendance at Friday\u2019s game against the Mercury. Fans who attending the game will also have an opportunity to pick up a \u2018Wings\u2019 poster of their own."

Not hearing anything, she opened the window and inserted the nail file against the edge of the screen. She had tried previously to remove the screen to no avail though she had managed to loosen it from the frame. After several thrusts, the screen moved enough that she could curl her fingers around it.\n\u201cDrat,\u201d she mumbled, when she yanked too hard and the screen ricocheted into the air. She stuck her head out the third-floor window. The screen was nowhere in sight, not that she\u2019d be able to retrieve it if she did see it.\nGeraldine took two small steps and stopped. She looked back at the window where the flowered curtains swayed. Though the evening was warm, she shivered.\nGeraldine scanned the woman\u2019s face. Was she making fun of her, laughing at her?\n\u201cCrazy like this?\u201d Geraldine inserted her index fingers into her mouth and stretched her mouth toward her ears. She stuck out her tongue and waggled it at Alice, just as Alice waggled fingers at her.\nGeraldine sighed and followed Alice to the dining room. After sitting at the table for several minutes, she feigned illness and returned to her room. She was thankful Alice had forgotten about the open window, for Geraldine would incur the caregiver\u2019s wrath had she noticed the missing screen.\nGeraldine had suffered eating disorders in the past. Recently, she had decided she\u2019d love to fly but knew she was too heavy and lumpy. By not eating dinner, she had morphed into a svelte and beautiful woman, and for the first time, she had a man swooning after her. Warmth spread through her veins when the man in the moon twinkled as if he had stars for eyes.\nShe would soon meet her prospective lover. And fly!\nThe breeze still jostled the curtains and blew the fabric across her arm. She stuck her head out the window, hoping again to locate the screen, but realized it was futile in the dark.\nPressing her dress against her leg, she contemplated changing into her favourite polyester slacks, until she realized the dress would aid flight. She pushed the wooden chair to the window. As were all windows on the second and third floors, the narrow window stretched tall, like a headstone reaching to heaven. In the daylight, the glass shimmered in the sun; when darkness fell, night lights peeped from several windows, camouflaging lives existing behind hollow shadows.\nShe climbed onto the wider-than-normal ledge, which was a feat at her fifty-nine years, and almost toppled trying to swing her leg up and over. She steadied herself by grabbing the window jamb. Once the other leg dangled over the ledge, she searched the sky. Stars beckoned. The moon gazed.\nGeraldine pictured herself soaring through the air, her arms outstretched like wings; her stiff legs would mimic an airplane\u2019s tail, while her billowing grey dress would resemble the hulky hull. She smiled at the image and even felt the winds caressing her like a silk glove.\nShe contemplated taking off, soaring like an eagle up to the moon. He\u2019d be so happy to see her, and they\u2019d live happily ever after. She\u2019d succeed in flight, unlike those poor victims of the Twin Towers on 9-11 who had failed when they flapped their arms.\nThe sudden rush of air bombarded her before she realized she had fallen. Even had she wanted to flap her arms, there was no time. She hit the ground within seconds but not before glimpsing the missing window screen wedged between low-lying branches."

Cue shimmering sun-kissed skin, rich berry-hued lips and those striking supermodel fringes we\u2019re all dreaming of perfecting. That\u2019s right \u2013 we\u2019re bringing you the must-have beauty and hair trends fresh from the SS17s shows. If that wasn\u2019t enough, we\u2019ll show you how to recreate the looks and beauty rituals at home with a few insider tips. Let\u2019s get started.\nDial up evenings with dewy skin and vampy lips.\nMaster the art of the \u2018All Nighter\u2019 with a high-octane, dark power lip. Rich wine and purple tones from autumn/winter are sticking around for spring\u2026 because if it ain\u2019t broke, why fix it, right? Enrich plum-hued lips with a sprinkling of glitter and keep the rest of the look minimal; think ultra-dewy skin highlighted across the cheeks, temples and cupids bow to give an added glow. To complete this low-key evening look, add just a flicker of mascara and keep hair ultra-shiny and sleek in a centre parting. This trend certainly makes us want to go out, out\u2026 who needs sleep when you can look like this?\nThe one word for spring\u2019s biggest hair trend? Choppy.\n\u2018Bangs for spring?\u2019 we hear you say. Most definitely, in long, choppy lengths that skim across the eyebrows and cheekbones. On the SS17 catwalks the trend was light and free, with fringes and bobs channelling spring\u2019s new mood. Worn grown out, with tousled, beachy waves for a relaxed boho vibe, when it comes to spring\u2019s bob trend, go for loose lengths over blunt edges. If in doubt, choose razor cut layers for an effortless \u2018I just woke up like this\u2019 look.\nLook luminous with glowing skin and berry lips.\nChannelling that post-spin class glow in the very best sense, highlighter is the key to recreating this luminous look fresh from the catwalk. Apply highlighter where light would naturally bounce off your face, from the tops of your cheekbones and brow bones, over the bridge of your nose and in the cupid's bow of your lips. When it comes to this dewy day look, all eyes are on the skin, so scale it back with bushy brows for a natural vibe. Berry-red stained lips add a pop of colour to create a just-bitten finish that easily transitions into the evening.\nGo for gold with sun-kissed skin and soft shades.\nEffortlessly chic and perfect for those up-coming outdoor events (festival or garden party, anyone?) \u2013 the bohemian make-up trend is one we\u2019ll certainly be sticking to this season. To create a natural look as if you\u2019d spent the day in the sun, apply an illuminating foundation, then lightly dust bronzer in golden honey shades to the spots where the sun would naturally hit the skin. Add a touch of soft pink to the creases of the eyes and the apples of cheeks for a warm, rosy glow. Complete with a peachy pout; a balm will achieve just the right amount of shine."

Springtime is ready to flourish, and we\u2019re here for it. With a new season comes new trends, and this week, we\u2019re talking beauty! There\u2019s nothing like watching the bride glow from within on her big day, positively radiating as she walks down the aisle. Spring is the perfect season for a wedding, and boasts the prettiest of hues and trends for bridal makeup. Read on to get your glow on!\nForget the dark, smoldering eye look many associate with a traditional smokey eye. This season, swap your dark browns and blacks for golds and light chocolate shades. The effect is still sultry but doesn\u2019t weigh down your eyes. Try sweeping a bronze-gold shade all over the lid, and blending a warm chestnut shade into the crease. Voila! Smokey eye, reinvented.\nThink pink! Spring 2019 is all about the monochromatic trend of the same wash of color on all areas of the face. Baby pink eyeshadow looks feminine and soft, flushed cheeks look gorgeous in photos and rosy lips are flattering on all skin tones. You can\u2019t go wrong with this pretty spring trend!\nAdd some sparkle to your wedding day ensemble by wearing some glitter on your eyes. Pressed pigments, metallic shadows and chunky glitter are all ways to incorporate this look. Go for an iridescent or pinky-peachy sheen that won\u2019t appear too over the top with your wedding day look.\nFresh-faced, baby-smooth skin is in. Get the dewy look by using a facial oil for an all-over glow, highlighter for natural looking radiance, and illuminating face mist to set your makeup. Try a cream blush or liquid highlighter that will blend into your makeup to look more like skin.\nGet that just-got-back-from-vacation glow with just a few tips! For a candlelit glow, add a dab of argan oil on your collar bones and temples. Gently brush a bronzing powder all over the face and over your decollete to give your skin a boost of healthy looking color. Choose a powder with a subtle amount of shimmer to give your skin a sun-kissed luster.\nSay goodbye to heavy lipsticks and over-drying lip lacquers. A trend for spring is a kiss of color on the lips with a feathered effect. Lip stains and tinted lip balms are a great way to achieve this look, and keep your pout hydrated, too!\nWhich bridal beauty tip are you most excited to try?

She wanted to go for a Kate Moss vibe which he achieved by taking Cheekbones in Kate (\u00a325) over her eyelid then lining the eye with Eye2Eye in Universe (\u00a318) for a daytime smokey eye. Keeping the lips neutral with Lip2Cheek in Lady J (\u00a325), Lulu's favourite shade.\nAlex created this look on Lucy by first mixing Starlight (\u00a325) with BFF (\u00a335) to give an all over glow. He then swept Cheekbones in Kate (\u00a325) over and around the eye, layering over Eye2Eye in Faith (\u00a318). He added Eye2Eye in Sun (\u00a318) in the corners of Lucy's eyes which makes her green eye's pop. Lucy has Lip2Cheek in VeeBee (\u00a325) on her cheeks and Lip Luxe in Swainy (\u00a322) on the lips with a slick of Lyla (\u00a316) to keep the lips glossy.\nNicole is wearing Eye2Eye in Sun (\u00a318) and Eye2Eye in Faith (\u00a318) on her eye. Faith is such a beautiful neutral in Nicole's skin tone. On top of Nicole's naturally glowy skin, The Right Light in Sunlight (\u00a325) really highlights her cheeks and warms her face, giving her a holiday glow. Lip2Cheek in Munchkin (\u00a325) layered over with Lip Light in Glinda (\u00a324) gives a sophisticated finish."

In her hand, she held a pink rose that she had picked from Basil\u2019s garden. She thought the painter might think it was nice, she was always likening her to flowers. Something that Basil had said to her, on a sun-kissed evening, not more than a week ago, had stuck and replayed often in her head.\n\u201cYou are quite like a newly bloomed flower, Dorian. No matter which angle I should paint you from you will always remain exquisite.\u201d Dorian had smiled at the time, but she was now struck with a slight melancholy. Flowers didn\u2019t bloom forever. Did this mean she would soon wilt? She dismissed the thought for later contemplation as she neared the painter.\n\u201cWould you like it if I wore a flower in my hair for this one? I think I ought to try something different.\u201d She set the rose behind her ear to demonstrate. The pink petals matched the flush of her cheeks.\nBasil looked up from sorting out her paints and smiled at the girl, her eyes widened slightly and she hummed in approval, \u201cThat could be interesting. Yes, I think we shall! Come, come!\u201d The painter rushed past her and back into the warm garden. Dorian gave a breathy chuckle, and followed her through the tall, gold trimmed doors. Her sapphire eyes glistened in the sun's rays and she squinted, waiting not more than a second before she became accustomed to the light. Basil was arched over inspecting the flowers, searching through them with feverish fingers, dancing between the stems. Dorian moved over to a group of mar\u00e9chal niels and breathed in their soft scent. A bee buzzed past her, hesitating near the flower on her ear before moving on to a clump of lilac foxgloves.\nBasil rose from her search with several flowers held tenderly in her palm. She sat down on the dry, spring grass and motioned for Dorian to do the same.\n\u201cHere, come, sit!\u201d She patted the ground next to her quickly. The corners of Dorian\u2019s lips pulled upward, betraying her sparked interest, she did love when the artist became excited, it showed a quite different side to her usual reserved nature. She must remember to ignite the painters curiosity more often. She moved over and flung herself down on the grass next to Basil.\nThe painter seemed to hesitate, \u201cDo you mind lying your head on my lap? It would make this much easier.\u201d She looked down at her hands and fiddled with the flowers.\nBasil let out a breath of laughter, \u201cI think you are probably right, Dorian.\u201d She looked down at the young girl, suddenly filled with a rush of admiration that burned through her, lighting up her cheeks with a pink glow. She carefully moved Dorian\u2019s hair so that it was lying over her legs, the tips brushing the ground.\nA bumblebee danced near them, humming through the rainbow of flowers that calmly leaned side to side in the light breeze. The constant drone of London seemed to be more distant than usual, the two women were under a different sky. A sky that seemed to reflect a foreign sea, the soft transparent clouds, like small fish under the surface of the waves.\nDorian decided that this background complemented the artists face well, her black curls contrasted the light of the day, her olive eyes mixed with the aquatic blues of the sky, reminding her of the seaweed that coated the grey rocks of a summer beach. Her pale pink lips were quite a likeness to the wisps of clouds, they looked like a brushstroke of rouge against the pale canvas of the artists face.\nThe light shone through the painters locks, leaving shadows that chased each other over Dorian\u2019s ivory face. The darks of her pupils reflect the sun's rays, making her eyes turn a lighter shade of blue until they were quite like diamonds. Her soft, scarlet lips were slightly parted and Basil felt the young girls breath mist her arm as she entwined the stems of the roses through her golden curls.\nThe painters fingers moved in artistic strokes against Dorian\u2019s skin. Dorian let her eyes fall shut and rested her focus on the feeling of the slender hand working it\u2019s delicate art through her hair. Everywhere it went, Dorian felt as though it left a trail, she could feel the lines the artist had traced on her even after her hand had moved on to expertly braid another flower through her locks. Her breath hitched as Basil\u2019s hand grazed her rose flushed cheeks to stroke a stray curl of gold behind her ear.\n\u201cNo.. It\u2019s not that.\u201d Dorian mumbled, crossing her porcelain arms over her chest. The painter squinted down at her, smirking at the almost petulant look on her face. She looked very much like a vexed child.\nDorian suddenly brought her hands up to meet Basils, pulling them back down to her face. \u201cJust continue what you were doing, please! It really is quite relaxing!\u201d She whined.\nBasil smiled in amusement but obliged with her wishes, hesitating before smoothing her long fingers over the ivory curves of the younger woman's face, tracing down the edge of her chin and onto the soft arches of her neck. Dorians breath trembled as the artist grazed over the dimple of her throat, then down against her collarbone.\nHer expression was different now than it was in any of the portraits she had drawn before. It was like playing upon an exquisite violin. She answered to every touch and thrill of the bow. There was something terribly enthralling in the exercise of influence. Her scarlet lips were parted like the petals of a blooming rose, Basil thought that she would like to drown in the sweet pink of them, but quickly dismissed the thought.\nThe artist explored her neck with flower-like fingers, caressing the soft skin that resigned there, observing the girls reactions. She felt that the girl would be her masterpiece as she brushed a finger up the centre of Dorian\u2019s neck and her delicate eyelids fluttered slightly open. If only she could capture that look, lure it onto a canvas where she could have it to look at always. Although, then Basil felt that she did not want to become accustomed to this look, she wanted her heart to jump to her throat everytime it passed Dorian\u2019s face, she wanted to be the one who caused it.\nBasil finished braiding the flowers through Dorian\u2019s hair, they formed a sun-kissed pink crown atop her forehead and mixed beautifully with the golden rays of her curls.\n\u201cOh Dorian, roses compliment you perfectly!\u201d Basil gasped, awestruck by the girls radiance. Dorian opened her eyes and looked up at her, grinning in response to the compliment.\n\u201cThank you, Basil\u201d The girl hummed, \u201cDo you think we are ready for painting now?\u201d The artist hesitated, not wanting to move from this spot, from this perfect moment. She traced slow circles in the girls shoulder and gave a small smile down to her.\n\u201cYes, I think so.\u201d The artist sighed. Dorian rose and straightened out her clothes, before offering her willowy hand out for the painter. Basil accepted and was pulled up by the younger woman so she was standing just a bit too near her. Dorian\u2019s hand still held on.\nTheir eyes met, each of them searching for something in the others, some sign that what was about to happen, should happen. Basil thought that the girl must be able to hear her heart, it was beating much too loud. She had not noticed the difference in height between them until now that they were so close, it was slight, but Dorian still turned her face up to see her. The light caught her eyes perfectly at this angle, the shades of blue rippled like a river with slivers of silver dancing under the shallows.\nThe tip of Dorian\u2019s tongue slipped out and ran over her bottom lip in one swift motion and Basils breath caught in her throat. She started to speak but before she could say anything Dorian rushed forward, covering the artists lips with hers. Basil froze as Dorian\u2019s hand went to the back of her neck and she moved further into the kiss. This is what she\u2019d wanted since she first laid eyes on the girl but now that it was actually happening she couldn\u2019t seem to move. The world spun around her and she tightened her grip on Dorian\u2019s hand as she felt she might faint or choke or both. A sickly happiness grew in her stomach and it was all so much and it was perfect, this was perfect, Dorian was perfect. The younger woman tentatively tasted her way around the artists mouth, exploring every line and curve. Her teeth tugged lightly at the artist\u2019s lip as she pulled back, still close enough for Basil to feel her shallow breaths on her skin.\nShe slid her hand up into the painters hair, exploring its soft curls and waves. Her mouth brushed against the curves of the artists lips as she leaned into the chalk scent of her skin. The artist felt Dorian\u2019s hand begin to slide up her leg and she quickly grabbed it before she could go any further. There was already rumours spreading about her being seen with other women, she didn\u2019t want Dorian to be pulled into them too... But she did want this, she did want Dorian, she was selfish. She didn\u2019t care about her reputation or Dorian\u2019s, they could both be dragged through the mud for all she cared, all she wanted was this, this perfect moment, and she just wanted to be able to enjoy it today without worrying about tomorrow. Basil sighed and entangled their fingers together. She brought them up to her lips and placed soft, lingering kisses on the younger woman's hand. The look on Dorian\u2019s face told her everything she needed to know, it was okay, they would be okay. She joined her hands together behind the girl\u2019s neck, pulling her forwards so their foreheads rested against each other. She closed her eyes, letting her worries and doubt wash further away with each wave of Dorian\u2019s breath. She focused on the blooming flowers of amour growing inside her and smiled. Everything would be okay.\n\u201cExcuse me, ma\u2019am, but it is nearing 2 o\u2019clock, would you like me to set the table for-\u201c Parker trailed off as he stepped through the door, realizing he had probably interrupted something.\nBasil saw a contagious smirk pass Dorians face, causing her to give a soft laugh.\n\u201cNo. No, in fact, you can take the rest of the day off, Parker. You have been working very hard recently.\u201d She never took her eyes off of Dorians.\n\u201cThank you, ma\u2019am, very kind of you.\u201d Parker turned and left the girls alone in their embrace. Basil was thankful that her servant was not one who liked to partake in gossip or this could have been a more unfortunate matter.\n\u201cDo you think you could start your painting tomorrow instead? I don\u2019t feel as though I could stay sitting still today.\u201d Dorian whispered against the artists ear. A line of goosebumps ran down her neck at the sound of the girl\u2019s voice so close to her.\nDorian\u2019s hands found their way back down the artists body and this time Basil did not stop her."

                            "text": "Dr Patel ran his finger along the back of his collar and down the length of his tie. Smoothing out the striped navy blue and yellow silk with its embroidered Club crests, he rolled the tie half way up his shirt, then unrolling it, pressed it down on his belly. He made his way to the front of the reception hall that was filled with tables covered in white cloths, ornate flower arrangements and candelabras, till he got as close as he could to the head table. There he pulled out a chair and sat down to wait for the bride and groom, as if he were part of their family.\nHe was, as usual, too early. He was particular about timing. He hated being kept waiting himself, and so he made a point never to be late. But no one in Nairobi\u2019s high society appreciated the finer aspects of his character, his sense of propriety and his polished etiquette. Dr Patel sighed, caressing the silky fabric of his tie, from the knot to the bottom. He was glad he\u2019d decided to wear it, even though the famous crest and stripes design was never recognised and no one had ever asked him about his membership with the Club.\nA few more guests arrived and they huddled together around a table at the back of the room, a group whose wealth, businesses, friends were all inherited. Not that he had anything against inheritance, but he\u2019d seen that it made men, like those at this wedding, lazy and self-confident. It made them take for granted those things which he had worked for. He hadn\u2019t inherited the position of Head of Human Resources at Amber Investments, he\u2019d earned it day in and day out for twenty years, and he\u2019d even worked on Saturdays. He deserved some respect for that. His friends called him Doctor Patel, out of affection and deference, because of his accomplishments. But he\u2019d outgrown his friends\u2019 company and the new acquaintances did not give him the respect he deserved, and often did not even remember him.\nThe Kantilals entered the room. The eldest son had recently been bequeathed several hundred acres of agricultural land by his father, and he shook hands with everyone at the entrance and at the back table, saying hello to a man there, waving to so and so, patting this uncle on the back and kissing that aunty on the cheek, and smiling at no one in particular. They were followed by the Shahs, reserved and unsmiling as they walked to the front of the hall, cloaked in their multi-generational wealth.\nA couple came over. \u2018May we please join you?\u2019 asked the man. \u2018I\u2019m sorry these are reserved for the family,\u2019 replied Dr Patel.\nThe couple looked at each other. The man pulled out two chairs and they sat down.\nDr Patel was sure they were not related to the groom. The woman\u2019s dress, even to his inexperienced eye, was unfashionable and drab in its cut and design and as for the man\u2019s trousers, worn so high around the waist, he hadn\u2019t seen anybody wearing a gaudy belt like that since the seventies. What right had they to sit here? He had earned his place at this table. He was closer than family. Only a few months ago the groom\u2019s father had phoned him.\nAnd so here he was, closer than family.\n\u2018Are you family?\u2019 asked the man with the belt.\nDr Patel reached into his pocket and took out his card holder. He gave one to the man and another to his wife.\n\u2018Those who know me well call me Doctor.\u2019 Dr Patel put away his wallet and took out his new phone. He frowned and shook his head to indicate he had just received an important message.\nDr Patel looked at her with a semi-raised eyebrow. He put down his phone, fumbled in his pocket and pulled out a creased cream envelope. \u2018I have my gift here,\u2019 he said, taking two crisp notes from his wallet and putting them in the envelope. He added one of his business cards, licked the flap and pressed it down with his short fingers. \u2018Do you have a pen I could borrow?\u2019 he asked.\n\u2018I believe I do,\u2019 the woman said, producing a gold biro from her bag.\nDr Patel noticed a look pass between the man and his wife. He wasn\u2019t sure why, maybe he had embarrassed them with his generous gift? He wrote the bride\u2019s name and returned the pen. The woman turned away from him.\nDr Patel leaned back in his chair and picked up his phone again. He was sure his relaxed manner, as he prepared his gift, had made them feel awkward. They must have spent a long time deciding what to give, and he had been able to do it so easily, so generously.\nBy now almost all the guests had arrived. Two more couples Dr Patel had met before made their way to the table and when they introduced themselves, he handed them his card. \u2018We\u2019ve met before,\u2019 he said. \u2018Only last week in fact, at the temple fund raising meeting. If you remember, I was on the chairing committee, I\u2019m the treasurer.\nThe couples half smiled at each other, pulled out their chairs and sat down. Dr Patel poured himself a glass of water and took a sip. It wasn\u2019t as if he was an easy person to forget; his fair skin, thick head of hair and ample size, commanded awe. But no one had ever said, \u2018Ah yes, Dr Patel, I remember you. We met on the 4th of February at the Khans.\u2019 He remembered every one of them as he repeatedly handed out his business card, and he despised them for their weak memories.\nThe three couples were discussing businesses investments and who was related to the groom\u2019s family. Then the conversation turned to the latest scandal. A priest at one of the temples had taken an overdose and left a note: \u2018God has finally acknowledged my life\u2019. \u2018What a profound man he must have been,\u2019 said the woman. Dr Patel stared at his empty plate and fingered his tie. If only they\u2019d ask him, he\u2019d be able to explain that dilemma in detail. But the couples continued to discuss the incident amongst themselves.\nThe waiters came around with the starters: chicken tikka on skewers, tawa fish, king prawns, samosas and mutton kebabs. Wine was flowing like water, as was the champagne, and here he was right in the middle of these rivers, at ease with the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of Nairobi society. How he loved these sounds, the tinkle of expensive cutlery, the low sophisticated chatter and the classical music from the sitar and the tablas played by the highly paid musicians in the corner. Dr Patel looked down at the musician seated on the carpet. He recognised the raag Kalyan melody always sung at weddings and raised his hand in a benevolent way. \u2018Wah, wah,\u2019 he said.\nThe man made a salaam in return, and Dr Patel beamed.\n\u2018Aren\u2019t you going to eat anything, Doctor?\u2019 asked Gokul.\n\u2018I\u2019m a vegetarian,\u2019 replied Dr Patel.\n\u2018I don\u2019t take alcohol,\u2019 Dr Patel answered. Shifting his eyes away from the vulgar belt around Gokul\u2019s middle, he picked at random a man in a grey suit at a nearby table and waved. Without interrupting his conversation, the grey-suited man nodded acknowledgement.\nWhen the waiter came, Dr Patel asked him for a small salad and a glass of water. The men gave each other furtive glances, and the women looked down and smiled. Dr Patel guessed they were shamed by their own decadent and indulgent eating habits. He pressed his huge belly closer to the table, drank a dainty sip of water and dabbed his chins with his napkin.\nEveryone clapped as the bride and groom entered the hall and walked around the room hand in hand. Then came speeches and wedding jokes which Dr Patel had heard many times, followed by the clinking of knives against glasses, with shouts of \u2018Kiss the bride\u2019. Amidst the frivolity around him, Dr Patel struck a particular pose he had perfected, one of serious contemplation. He looked up when he realised one of the women at his table was talking to him. He stared in bewilderment at her moving lips.\n\u2018Have you come alone, Dr Patel?\u2019 she repeated.\nHe thought of his wife\u2019s raucous laugh, Sejal could never be part of this haute society. Even after two decades, she hadn\u2019t learnt the art of subtlety and she hampered his style.\n\u2018Yes, I\u2019m alone,\u2019 he mumbled. He took his phone from his pocket and frowned. \u2018An urgent matter has come up at work,\u2019 he said. \u2018Please excuse me.\u2019 He stood up, the starched napkin falling from his lap, and stumbled through the crowd to the exit. In a daze, he reached his car, took off his tie and flung it onto the passenger seat.\nHe drove until he came to a fork in the road and halted at a traffic light. What had gone wrong? He had just the vaguest inkling that he hadn\u2019t impressed those at his table, yet he\u2019d done what he always did \u2013 stayed aloof with an air of reflecting on important matters.\nWhen the lights changed, he put his foot on the accelerator and instead of taking the road to his right which took him home, he took the left turning towards a roundabout.\nHe drove around it. \u2018This is my true friend, Dr Patel,\u2019 the groom\u2019s father had said, with his arm around him, when he\u2019d introduced him to his friends. The affection was a clear signal to everyone that he was just like them.\nDr Patel swung his car round again. There was no traffic as it was after midnight. What envy he\u2019d seen on the faces of that shabby couple when he\u2019d put the money and his business card into the envelope with the shining golden logo of Amber! They had no flair, no panache, but he had risen from that same world of unsophistication through his own initiative, and now fitted in with the most successful in society.\nHe rolled down the window and let his arm rest on the ledge. He felt the cool wind in his face as he drove faster round the island. He lived in leafy Lavington, in a three bedroomed house with a heated swimming pool and a sunken bath tub and he drove a four wheeler Forester. He sent his children to private school, and his family had annual holidays abroad, in Europe and America. So what if it was all paid for by Amber? This was his success. He wasn\u2019t called \u2018Doctor\u2019 for nothing.\nAnd that was not all, he\u2019d even found himself a mistress. He had the complete lifestyle. Of course people talked, but that was the point. They said he could afford a mistress, just like any other man of success and social standing. He was good enough for two women, his wife and a younger woman willing to be with him, on his terms. Dr Patel swerved the car.\nHe parked in the empty car park and decided to wait until he saw other people enter the apartment block. He usually made a point of seeing his mistress at a time when everyone was coming home from work. He\u2019d alight from his car holding his phone to his ear, and lean against the door with a pre-occupied air. Initially, the neighbours used to nudge each other and snigger. This gave him much pleasure, while he remained intent on his phone conversation. Now they no longer reacted, but this did not bother him. His reputation as a virile lover had been established.\nHe picked up his tie from the seat beside him. Rolling the smooth silk between his fingers and then unravelling it again, he held up the strip of cloth in the dim lights of the car park. Oh, how beautiful it was. He had had to have it especially made because he wasn\u2019t an actual member of the Club. He laid it flat on his thigh, stroked it and placed it lovingly back on the seat.\nHe noticed a young couple waiting at the entrance so he hastily slid out of the car and joined them. They entered the building and Dr Patel whistled raag Kalyan so they would remember him. He knocked on Afshan\u2019s door. There was no answer, so he knocked again.\nShe stood in the doorway dressed in a black lace negligee, satin gown and high heeled slippers. Her hair fell around her shoulders silky and smooth, and as she tilted her head, something glinted in her nose. Strange, he hadn\u2019t noticed the ring before. \u2018May I come in?\u2019 He caught his breath at her delicate perfume. So, she\u2019d been expecting him?\nShe stepped aside to let him pass and shut the door. Dr Patel waited in the corridor. \u2018It\u2019s very late,\u2019 she said, pulling her gown closer, and fumbling with the belt.\n\u2018I, I\u2026\u2019 He stared at her.\n\u2018Of what?\u2019 She looked over his shoulder at the door.\n\u2018I think you should leave,\u2019 she said.\nShe opened the door and looked towards the elevator. He turned, there was no one there.\n\u2018But I\u2019ve made sure you get regular promotions and a bonus. We have an understanding.\u2019 He held out the notes.\nShe shrugged and took the money.\nThe door slammed and Dr Patel walked slowly to the elevator. As he entered the lift, a slim, clean-shaven, young man was exiting.\n\u2018Good evening,\u2019 he said. \u2018Dr Patel, I presume?\u2019 The man was dressed in faded blue jeans and a white t-shirt. \u2018I notice you\u2019re not wearing your famous Club tie tonight, Doctor?\u2019 Any other time, Dr Patel would have been flattered, but he frowned and made no acknowledgment. He went down to the car park and was puzzled to find the car unlocked. Then he remembered he\u2019d left it in a hurry. He must be more careful.\nHe drove back to the roundabout, swinging around it at full speed. To Nairobi society, he was Afshan\u2019s lover, and tonight like any other, he\u2019d visited her and been just himself. She\u2019d hesitated over his gift and been eager for him to leave. Tonight most of all he\u2019d needed her friendship, but she hadn\u2019t understood.\nHe circled the island one more time. He thought how Gokul had asked several times if he was feeling all right. Dr Patel had squinted at his salad and poked the lettuce leaves as if lost in thought, yet all the while he\u2019d listened intently to the easy banal chit-chat from which he\u2019d been excluded.\nThe traffic lights turned red and he braked. He reached for his tie absentmindedly, but felt only shirt buttons. He turned to the seat beside him, fumbled where he must have left it, and then felt near the hand brake, but there was no sign of it.\nThe lights changed to green. Accelerating, he swerved the car towards the apartment block again, parked in the same spot as before and alighted from the car. Using his phone as a torch, he flashed it here and there, but could not see his precious tie anywhere.\nHe drove back to the island and veered towards home, oblivious of the red lights he was skipping. When he reached the gates of his mansion, he stopped. He sat there drumming his podgy fingers on the steering wheel and switching the headlights on and off, again and again. Then he smiled. Of course, the young man in the lift had admired Dr Patel\u2019s car on his way in and noticed the Club tie on the seat. Dr Patel laughed aloud.

                            "text": "I was receiving the worst Christmas gift of my life on December 20, 1998. So there I was, wondering if my eyes were ever going to open again. A heart attack at the rich age of eighty-three. McDonald's, you better hope I don't wake up.\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" a small voice filtered into my slightly-drooping left ear. Suddenly the tangy stench of disinfectants assaulted my nostrils. I could hear the beeping of vital-checking instruments. A soft glow of fluorescents curtained over my closed lids.\nSlowly I opened my eyes and squinted to where the voice came from, \"Who are you?\" I groggily asked. All I could see was a patch of downy, sand-colored hair. It was in fact a boy standing at my bedside. Or a midget with an abnormally small head.\n\"Tony, but my mommy calls me Little Tony.\" It was definitely a child. The boy warily popped his head higher into my vision. He was the color of dirtied white chalk with dark blue eyes.\nI proclaimed my name before he asked. An old habit. \"I'm Mayor Alec Warren,\"\nTony's eyes went wide with shock. \"I'm sorry I woke you up Mr. Mayor!\"\nMy laugh and smile were reassuring to him. \"Na, kid, it's fine,\" I said through my raspy chuckles. It really was okay to me. I've had enough rest. He smiled back, eyes bright. \"So what can I do for you kid?\"\nHe frowned now and glanced down, and then back to me. \"I can't find my mommy,\" he sniffled.\nI frowned too and sat up against the backboard of the hospital bed. The joints in my old elbows popped loudly. \"Alright, well I can't do much lying in bed,\" I told him. Slowly turning, I pressed the red intercom button to speak to the nurse. It's buzz startled me and my heart lurched a little.\n\"Am I in trouble?\" Tony asked my back. I shook my head definitively so I didn't have to turn.\n\"No, I just gotta tell my guard to get in here to help you.\"\nFinally the intercom buzzed again and the tired female voice filtered through. \"What can I get for you Mayor?\"\n\"Is Archer around up there?\" I asked her.\n\"No,\" she paused. \"Are you okay sir?\"\n\"I'm great actually, but a little kid stumbled in my room looking for his mom.\" I glanced over my shoulder. Tony was looking at the floor and picking at grimy nails. He had backed away from the bed to give me space.\nHis over-sized black Tonka truck sweater looped over red sweatpants. \"Oh, alright, uh, I'll send an officer up,\" the nurse at the receptionist's desk answered after a moment.\n\"Thanks darling, have a good evening,\" I told her.\nMy eyebrows furrowed. \"What time is it?\"\n\"Just a little before midnight sir. Maybe your guard is asleep. Something you should be doing right now.\"\nI thought was reasonable enough. \"Okay thanks, have a good one.\"\n\"You to sir,\" she answered and clicked off.\nTurning back around with a few more pops I looked at the kid again. Tony looked like he had walked out of a slum. \"Is your mom a patient or doctor or nurse or something kid?\"\nHe sniffled and wiped his little nose on the back of a small hand. \"Before the car hit us she said we wouldn't have much of a Christmas anyways,\"\nOh no, I thought as my heart squeezed violently. I coughed hard into a shaking fist, the spasms painful against my old body. Don't tell me she's dead boy. Don't you dare. I didn't think my old heart could take that stress. One of my citizens dying in a car accident just before Christmas? That wasn't right, it was just flat out depressing.\nThe tears flowed freely from his wide eyes and my heart clenched. I rested my head against the pillow again and closed my eyes. My heart was beating fast again from exhaustion, this kid needed to get out of here and fast! The vital-measurements went wild and Tony's wailing grew in intensity. Which in turn sped up my heart. A voice in my head didn't help either.\nFool! it screamed. There is a boy in trouble. Get out of bed and exert, exert, exert!\nThe last thing I heard were screaming voices and running footsteps. Someone whisked the screaming boy into the air. Sweat was pouring out of my body and it started jerking. Pain took over in violet thrusts of heart against lung. It hurt so much. A sharp and cold needle was driven into my arm and I could see the face of an angel above in a halo of bright lights.\nShe was so worried, this angel. A cool rag was pressed hard against my forehead. There was no sound but my trumpeting heart. The sheets became clouds. I could feel a male angel's hands on my chest, pushing whatever life they could into me.\nI woke up after a what felt like five minutes. The moon was shining it's cold warmth through the blinds. \"Hello?\" I weakly asked. Immediately there was the rustle of magazine pages and two large footsteps. Kareem my guard popped into view. He was a chocolate man with no hair on his head. A black turtleneck didn't modestly expose the muscles he had.\nHe smiled and let out a breath of gratitude. \"Sorry about earlier,\"\nI shook my head laughed, the pain was finally gone completely from my chest. \"Flirting with the nurses huh?\"\nHe frowned now and my own laugh dissipated. \"No, I mean about the kid,\"\n\"His depressing story was what got to me, but I'm fine now.\" I paused. \"What time is it?\"\nKareem glanced down at his watch. \"About four sir,\" he pulled at the triangular black goatee. It was a habit he couldn't get over.\n\"Did Tony find his mother?\" I asked.\n\"Who?\" he furrowed his eyebrows.\nHis eyes widened. \"Oh,\" he paused, \"I have no idea. I was worrying about you the whole time, not the kid.\"\nI sighed and shook my head, \"Is there anyone still here who knows where the kid is?\"\n\"Doctor Carl,\" Kareem suggested. Doctor Carl was my doctor.\nKareem's dark brown eyes were gleaming now. He hated giving me horrible news. Now he had something cheerful though. \"He's looking after the boy's mother. All the kid had to say was he just got out of an accident and they found her.\"\nI nodded solemnly and sat up. He tried pushing me back down but I waved at him dismissively. \"That is good, so how is she?\"\n\"Not good I'm afraid,\" a thick voice said out of nowhere. Kareem tensed and looked up at Dr. Carl. The fat man had a clipboard nestled between his expansive gut and sagging chest. His face was only slightly red because he carried the weight well with height. \"I don't mean to be the evil doctor or anything...\"\nHe frowned and stepped closer to look directly down at me. \"Miss Lucas is a very, very poor woman. She can't pay for the operation, and insurance sure as hell can't either.\"\n\"What operation would that be,\"\n\"We need to give her a new kidney, it was pierced by the shifting gear.\" he was blatant and clear with his answer.\nMy eyes widened and Kareem just blinked at him. \"How did that happen?\"\nDr. Carl scratched at what little hair he on either side of his head with a free hand. \"Ms. Lucas leaned over to protect her son and was impaled. It's imperative we replace it soon. We do have a kidney that just flew in recently enough.\"\nMy sigh was deep. \"Shame, a real shame,\" Kareem shook his head and looked at the ceiling. My next decision almost had no real thought to it. But my citizen was in danger, my job was to protect them. I didn't know the kid for long but I was in a giving mood right now.\n\"I'll pay for the operation myself,\" I told Dr. Carl.\nBoth Kareem and the doctor looked at me, shocked. \"Sir?\" Dr. Carl wheezed. His brown eyes were bug-like behind thick glasses.\n\"You heard me, I'll pay for her operation. I'm too rich anyway,\"\n\"It's pricey,\" Dr. Carl warned with squinted eyes.\n\"I'm the very rich mayor of this town. Now do as I say or lose your job on the spot,\" I chided him. \"Do we understand each other?\"\nHe nodded and hurried out of the room. I looked up at Kareem, who wore a bemused smile on his face. \"Well aren't we all righteous tonight?\"\nI chuckled harshly. \"When you rule your own small town and actually care about the people, you'll understand.\"\nDoctor Carl eventually came back to do some basic tests. I passed them all and was told I could leave. After dressing in a green and red sweater- with a frightening resemblance to Freddy Krueger- and jeans, I asked Kareem to find the kid again. He nodded and left quickly without a word. The mother was in surgery by now.\nThe receptionist showed me to the waiting room and promised to bring Kareem along with the kid. I sat in the corner and flipped through a Times Magazine. I didn't have to wait long until my guard gracefully quick-stepped his way to me.\n\"He's sound asleep sir, I didn't think I should wake him. A hot receptionist told me he'll be just fine though, she's watching after him.\"\nI nodded. \"You have got to get yourself a girlfriend man,\" I teased and laughed at him. He laughed to and nodded vigorously.\"\n\"I guess I do,\" he rasped through chuckles.\nAfter the laugh we weaved our way to the receptionist's desk. The mid-aged brunette woman glanced up. \"Glad your fine Mayor,\" she said with a tired smile.\nI smiled back. \"Tell Dr. Carl to give me updates on the surgery of a Ms. Lucas,\"\nShe nodded an affirmative. \"Sure thing, these chairs aren't that comfy sir. I suggest at least going home,\"\nKareem groaned softly behind me. He was tired and worried for me. It was unnecessary though. I turned to him. \"I really think you should get home,\" he told me.\n\"How about you go home? I'll be fine for tonight. Get some sleep and come back later,\"\nHe eyed me sternly for a long moment. Finally he left me standing at the receptionist's desk. I nodded to the woman and slowly walked back to my chair. It took quite a boring while but the doctor kept to his word and gave details on the surgery. Nothing too graphic. The mother was doing just fine now. This Christmas was lightening up perfectly.\nI didn't realize I had fallen asleep until a rough hand shook my shoulder. Delirious, I gazed up at a mop of blonde hair. Curly and long with various shades of gold. \"I'm sorry to wake you sir,\" it was a woman's soft voice. Barely above a whisper.\n\"No, it's alright. What time is it?\" I asked, blinking and squinting in the sudden sunlight. The waiting room was empty except for me, Kareem I could see in the corner of my vision, and this blonde woman. She had the same blue eyes as Tony I immediately assumed it was his mother.\n\"About one Mayor, you've been out longer than me.\" her smile was really tired though.\nHer smile still didn't leave and she nodded. \"I'm really sorry for the trouble he caused,\"\nI laughed at such a preposterous idea. \"Two heart attacks is all I'll get. Kids are worth it though,\"\n\"Yes, yes they are. Especially Tony,\" her voice dropped and her face glowed as she stared off to my left. Craning my head, I could see Tony asleep in Kareem's lap. My guard only seemed half-enthusiastic about a kid on leaning all over him. He smiled back at us and rolled his eyes though.\nMs. Lucas laughed but it quickly twisted into a slight frown. There were tears in her eyes and she wiped them away. Her body shuddered violently with a great intake of air. I wanted to tell her it was okay to cry but I just stayed quiet and solemnly watched. She was a strong woman. I could see that. \"I don't know how I can I thank you enough for helping with the operation.\"\n\"I just feel so bad by making you pay for it...\" her voice trailed off.\nTurning my body towards her, I gripped both of her red sweater shoulders. \"Don't. I'm an extremely rich man, your operation didn't even put a dent in my account. I promise, don't worry about it.\"\nShe nodded reluctantly. \"Well at least I can thank you for giving my great little boy a Christmas. I'm just so glad he didn't get a scratch,\"\n\"He was being watched by a real angel. And if I may be brutally honest,\" I suggested. She shrugged and nodded again. \"You look like an angel this fine morning,\"\nShe laughed and turned red in the face. \"You're his guardian angel though,\"\nI just smiled a little and nodded. She wasn't going to take no for an answer.\n\"You know,\" she paused, her voice cracking. \"Right before the crash he told me his Christmas wish,\" tears flowed through her eyes again. She ignored them and let them flow freely. \"He wanted one Christmas, for the first time ever,\"\nI nodded and told her to continue. She did. \"And while I was unconscious, I swear this sounds so weird. I could hear his other wish. All he wanted was for me to be alive this Christmas. Nothing else. I was his Christmas every year. Even if we couldn't afford a tree all these years.\"\nMy throat was tight in her pain. \"Well your alive now, fulfilling his wish. We need more folk like you in this town.\" I paused and thought. \"Ms. Christmas.\" I hugged her tight and she cried into my shoulder, mumbling her thanks inaudibly. I rubbed her back.\nTears came down my eyes in the true beauty of things. This little boy I barely knew was getting his first Christmas. It was all because of me and a beautiful woman I'll forever call: Ms. Christmas."

                            "text": "Eliza growled and threw the box down on the ground before looking back up in the mirror and glaring at her reflection. She hated the change and suddenly wished she could go back to her natural color, but knew that it was too late. The pigments had been stripped and she either had to wait until it grew out again or redye it a different orange.\n\"Hey, Eliza, I found\u2014what the hell?\" She glanced in the corner of the mirror to see Sam staring at her in shock. \"Why are you blonde?\" Eliza rolled her piercing green eyes.\n\"Isn&apos;t it obvious, or are you just that dumb?\" she snapped. \"No wonder why Crowley calls you Moose.\" Sam frowned slightly and turned to walk away when Eliza clenched her eyes shut, calling out his name. \"Wait. Stop. I&apos;m sorry.\" She leaned forward on the sink, both hands on the edge as she sighed. \"I didn&apos;t mean to snap at you. I&apos;m just pissed. It didn&apos;t turn out how I wanted it to.\"\n\"Why&apos;d you bleach it anyways?\"\n\"Advice from an old friend.\" She turned to look at the Hunter. \"And it&apos;s horrible. I should kill him.\" Sam chuckled, knowing she was joking. He shrugged, walking forward and twirling a lock around his finger as he studied it.\n\"Doesn&apos;t look bad. Blonde suits you, unlike Meg.\" The duo laughed. It was true. Meg really didn&apos;t look good as a blonde. \"I do like your orange hair, though. I&apos;m not saying that this is horrible but\u2014\" He shrugged again. \"\u2014what&apos;s done is done.\" Eliza nodded and sighed through her nose, her gaze meeting Sam&apos;s. He pulled his finger from her hair and stared into her eyes. They weren&apos;t as cold as they were the first time he&apos;d seen her. Sure, Gadreel was taking the reigns of his body, but he still saw her.\n\"Why were you so quick to side with Nadia?\"\n\"She&apos;s my mother. I trusted her like an idiot. And then Gadreel came into the picture and, well, I couldn&apos;t let Nadia kill him. He was using you as a meatsuit. I think you&apos;re definitely hotter alive.\" They both let out a short laugh, Sam shaking his head. Eliza unconsciously rubbed the Mark on her wrist as Sam continued to smile down at her.\n\"I can say the same to you.\" He leaned down and closed his hazel eyes, their lips centimeters apart. Right when they met they heard a crash from the kitchen and Sam sighed, pressing his lips in a thin line and pulling away. Eliza cleared her throat awkwardly.\n\"I think you should go make sure he&apos;s okay,\" she whispered. Sam nodded and rushed out to the kitchen, leaving Eliza to turn and look back at her reflection in the mirror. Her irises flashed black and she scowled, punching the sink. The basin only slightly cracked, but not enough to cause any damage or a leak. She eyed her bruised knuckles. She needed to find the Sword of Elizabeth and she needed it now.\n\"You&apos;re still here,\" Cas noted. She looked up from her phone and nodded, still biting her lower lip in thought. She sat in a black leather chair in the corner of the library, her knees pulled up to her chest and her legs bent to the side slightly, her bare feet tucked under her. Cas squinted his eyes and tilted his head to the side. \"Why are you blonde?\"\n\"Change. I like change, Castiel,\" she replied in a monotone.\n\"No I don&apos;t,\" she agreed, sighing and turning off her phone. \"I hate it. Get rid of it.\"\n\"I can&apos;t.\" She threw her head back and groaned. \"I do have a question.\"\n\"What else is new?\" she asked with a snort. Cas glared at her with his lips pressed in a thin line. He was most certainly not amused by the demon before him. \"What is it?\"\n\"How were you able to heal Sam? You said there was still some of your Grace left in you but I know that was a lie. All angels were cast from Heaven which is why you were split in two.\" Cas leaned forward. \"What are you hiding, Eliza?\" he hissed. She rolled her eyes and looked up again, eyebrows raised."

Besides him was the silent Doctor Strange.\nA visible difference could be heard from how he was greeted by the approaching boy then how Strange was. Doctor Strange smiling.\nTrevor. How have things been lately?\nTony looked the boy up and down and shivered. He was covered in eyes and the sight was quite unpleasant to look at. The boy smiled slightly at Doctor Strange.\nThings have been quiet here at the Institute. Although\u2026.\nDoctor Strange stepped towards the boy.\nIf you are here with him they certainly won\u2019t be for much longer.\nWhat is all of dis doom and gloom talk, petit gar\u00e7on? Sometimes a man comes to just say hello, no?\nSaid a voice over by the trees. They all turned to see Gambit leaning against one of the trees just outside their field of vision.\nDoctor Strange turned to Tony.\nWhat is Gambit doing here?\nHe\u2019s relatively easy to get as long as you have the cash.\nGambit walked closer to them and sighed.\nEvery man\u2019s got his price. Although, Gambit\u2019s might change when he finds out why you called him here, Monsieur.\nWhy did you pay for Gambit\u2019s services, Tony?\nYou said she had a particular accent.\nNot all world jumpers are alternate versions. You know that.\nIt\u2019s worth a shot. Unless, you have more to work with and aren\u2019t coming to me for help.\nLet me get dis straight. You had Gambit come over here to find you a girl who may a sound like me?\nHow many mutants of her possible level could not be known.\nDoctor Strange nodded his head.\nMolecular Manipulator. She was able to freeze me.\nFor dis Ch\u00e8re to freeze you is impressive, but a girl like her isn\u2019t from my bayou.\nShe is a world jumper. It may be possible she doesn\u2019t have the same powers here, if she does exist on this plane.\nIt\u2019s like you didn\u2019t come to me for help.\nDis doctors got a fair point, no? What makes you think she\u2019d up and show up around the bayou? She ain\u2019t from here.\nTony seemed to sigh even louder.\nListen here. If you found yourself in a new place it would be natural to seek some sort of familiar comfort.\nSo you are guessing here.\nTony moved a holographic display off of his watch interface.\nMy satellites are looking for her. This could only help.\nGambit wraps his arms around himself.\nThat\u2019s just cold, Doctor. Not even Sherlock.\nTony turned his attention back to Trevor. Who had been standing their silent.\nDo us a favor kid. Let your boss know a powerful mutant is on the loose. And the Avengers got it.\nGambit smiled at the boy.\nAnd that Gambit\u2019s on the case.\nTrevor turned to look at Doctor Strange. He just nodded his head.\nTell Wolverine that we will be in New Orleans.\nTrevor nodded and ran off towards the mansion. Tony smiling to himself.\nAt the very least, we will find some good beignets.\nDoctor Strange turned to Tony, but before he could speak Gambit smiled.\nBeen Gambit awhile since he\u2019s had one of those.\nBeen Strange awhile since he\u2019s had a good idea.\nA young girl was walking the streets of New Orleans with a bag of beignets in her hand. She was happily munching away when one of the girls besides her spoke up.\nPrincess, why are we here in this city?\nThe chance of being discovered is much greater then the chance of the target hiding out here, Princess.\nSaid the second girl to follow up the first. The girl licked some powdered sugar off of her fingers.\nI never got to leave the Island. Let me have a little fun while we wait for her come out.\nThe first girl stopped walking, causing the whole party to stop.\nWhat if, my dad turns up out of the bayou, Mei?\nMei nodded her head slowly at the girl\u2019s response. The girl smiled at her.\nMy dad is on his way back to this city, sure. But I left a tip with his old friends about his arrival.\nMei turned to look at the other girl. As always she had no expression on her face.\nEnergy readings indicate movement from both Guilds within New Orleans Proper.\nSee there. There is not reason to be worried.\nShe continued walking down a street. The other two following silently until she stopped in front of a cafe in the French Quarter. The two girls looking at her curiously. Mei speaking up.\nPrincess, are you still hungry?\nWe have guests to meet here.\nMei looked at her confused.\nThe other girl pointed to two boys standing by the wall inside. One of them seem excited while the other seemed bored.\nEnergy levels match those of Prince William and Prince Thomas.\nMei turned to see her Princess casually throwing out the bag of beignets before she said.\nPrincess, your mother gave explicit instructions not to contact anyone from your family.\nBut who else can we trust to help us catch the target?\nMei looked down at the floor. She did not know how to answer that. However, Meng tilted her head in confusion.\nPrincess, how did you know they would be here at this time?\nThe girl smiled and flashed a thumbs up.\nI sent him an email about a secret fan meeting event with Tyrion Lannister.\nMeng blinked a few times. While, Mei sighed. The girl leading the two into the restaurant. She headed over to the small bar table the two boys sat at in the back of the restaurant. She immediately sat down at their table, causing the two boys to pause in shock.\nHey there. I\u2019m new in town and could use your help.\nTommy recovering the fastest put down his drink and leaned forward.\nSure, thing. What can I do for you?\nInterrupted William. But before he could finish, the girl interrupted right back.\nYou are William and Tommy Maximoff. Otherwise known as Wiccan and Speed, no?\nWilliam looked at her confused, but Tommy sighed.\nI told you this secret fan meeting was a hoax.\nWilliam glared at his brother before speaking.\nWhy\u2019d you send me that email?\nI already told you. You have to help me find someone.\nSpeed leaned back in his chair.\nAnd why on Earth would we have to help you?\nThe girl leaned forward and beckoned them closer. The two boys leaning forward to listen to her whisper.\nThe two boys lean back in shock. William falling out of his chair drawing a crowd of onlookers. Mei offers him a hand and helps him up.\nMei nods her head and turns back towards the Princess. Tommy sighs.\nLook. No offense, but I\u2019m pretty sure we would know if you were our cousin.\nI wouldn\u2019t joke about our family\u2019s name. It tends to annoy grandfather.\nThe girl leaned forward, so she was staring Wiccan in the eye.\nWe both used to know he liked me more. Don\u2019t worry about me.\nWilliam leaned away. His face red. Tommy coughing to regain attention.\nEmbarrassing the dork, aside. Where\u2019s your proof? That we are cousins.\nThe girl turned to Meng. She pulled out a black jacket from her side bag. On it was the letter M. The two boys looked at each other shocked.\nI\u2019m not from your Earth. Mine\u2019s a little different, but you should understand with this right?\nWilliam shook his head in disbelief.\nThat reality is supposed to be Gone.\nThe girl smiled at him.\nYou think one reality is the only time grandfather succeeded?\nMeng put the jacket back in her bag and Tommy leaned forward.\nIf this true, who are your parents? Why are you here?\nThe girl sighed. The two surprised to not see her seem calm for once.\nA fugitive from our world escaped into this one.\nAnd why do you need our help? Why not the Avengers or the X-men?\nThere\u2019s no way I can go and trust them. They don\u2019t have a liking to our family. Besides, the target\u2019s a dangerous mutant. No time for politics.\nWilliam stood up from the table.\nThat definitely means you make time for politics.\nTommy shook his head no.\nWilliam turned to Tommy. His mouth open in shock.\nThe X-Men and Avengers haven\u2019t gotten along in awhile. If she\u2019s that dangerous we don\u2019t have time for them to decide what to do about her.\nWilliam glared at his brother.\nIF. IF SHE IS that dangerous. We don\u2019t know anything about her. Or This girl.\nTommy stood up from the table.\nWe know she is our cousin.\nWe know she CLAIMS to be our cousin.\nWilliam turned to glare at her.\nReally. Who are your parents then!\nThe girl blinked a few times and then hit her forehead lightly.\nAh. I was so stupid. I forgot to introduce myself. The names Iris. Iris LeBeau.\nShe stuck her hand out towards William. Tommy went ahead and shook it.\nPolaris. My mother is your Aunt Polaris.\nDidn\u2019t think those two would ever be a thing.\nIris shook her head no.\nThere not. It\u2019s just\u2026 Well, it\u2019s dad.\nTommy nodded his head in understanding.\nSo, Iris. This mutant we have to catch?\nPusillanimity. And not only does she have extremely strong psychic powers, but an extremely murderous vendetta on our family.\nNow, why would she have that?\nI may have been the one in charge of her scheduled enhancements\u2026.\nWilliam leaned forward. His arms crossed.\nIris looked down at the floor.\nSee. There is no reason to trust or help her.\nTommy looked at Iris. She was whispering to herself while looking down at the floor.\nShe put her head up and looked at the two of them annoyed.\nI said de girl went ahead and volunteered for de project. It\u2019s not my fault she chose it.\nYou see here, Billy. De girl went and signed up for de project. It\u2019s not her fault she chose it.\nBilly, trying to fight a smile, covered his face with his hand. Meng speaking up.\nPrincess, energy levels suggest large activity in City Park.\nTommy looked at her confused.\nAll members of the royal family follow certain nomenclature, Prince Tommy.\nTommy turned to William. A smirk on his face.\nPrincess, one of those energy readings is your father.\nNot good. Time for us to skedaddle.\nWilliam looked at her annoyed again.\nWhy are you running away from your dad?\nIris grabbed William\u2019s and Tommy\u2019s hands and started pulling them towards the cafe\u2019s exit.\nI\u2019ll tell you on the way to our next stop.\nI found us a place to crash."

                            "text": "The CEO of the world's largest chipmaker wants hardware developers thinking about graphics, low-power applications, and Intel's determination not to let AMD get the best of it again.\nWith the next two generations of Intel's chips set in place, the company is looking forward to a low-power future.\nSo said Intel CEO Paul Otellini in his keynote address kicking off the Intel Developer Forum at San Francisco's Moscone Center on Tuesday. Intel will launch the server and high-end desktop versions of its Penryn generation of chips on November 12, in line with previous reports to expect those chips before the Thanksgiving holiday. And Intel has also completed the design for Nehalem, a more radical overhaul of the company's chip blueprints.\nThe more interesting news was Otellini's goals for Intel over the rest of the decade. The company plans to ship a generation of processors on its 45-nanometer manufacturing technology by 2009 that come with graphics integrated right onto the processor, similar to what rival Advanced Micro Devices has planned for its Fusion chips. Intel will be investing in a joint venture with KDDI, a Japanese telecom company, with plans to build a WiMax network in Japan. And as expected, Intel talked up its low-power chips for MIDs (Mobile Internet Devices), with plans to reduce the power consumption of its handheld computer chips by a factor of 10 compared with the Silverthorne processor, expected next year.\nThis is all part of Intel's search for growth, which has meandered a bit this decade. Still, you've got to have a strategy for the future, especially as the PC market matures over the next five to 10 years. That appears to have three legs: first of all, don't squander the base market of PC and server processors.\nTo accomplish that, Otellini has implemented a more gradual series of manufacturing transitions that makes sure the company doesn't try to introduce a new architecture with a new manufacturing technology, and that it doesn't go too long in between revisions to its chips. The hope is that this prevents AMD from catching it napping and losing significant chunks of market share, which is probably the best description of the years from 2002 to 2006.\nThe second is graphics. AMD is forcing Intel's hand a bit in this area, with its purchase of ATI Technologies last year and the resulting plans for Fusion. Intel ships more graphics technology than anybody else on the planet, but that's only because it ships so many low-cost integrated graphics chipsets in desktops and notebooks, not because that graphics technology is extremely compelling. But the company wants to improve its performance in that area, hiring engineers and purchasing companies like Havok to improve its hardware and software expertise in graphics technology.\nAnd in the long term, Intel will attack the graphics market by accelerating the pace at which it develops graphics technology by using its most advanced manufacturing processes. Historically, Intel's integrated graphics products used older manufacturing technology too antiquated for cutting-edge processors, but that's changing.\nIn 2009 Intel will ship a processor that has 45nm graphics technology built onto the chip, and in 2010 it will introduce a chip for which both the CPU and the graphics technology were designed for the 32nm manufacturing technology slated for production during that timeframe, Otellini said. And for the high end of the market, and possibly the discrete graphics market currently owned by Nvidia and ATI, Intel will produce a processor called Larrabee with many configurable cores and a shared cache memory. Otellini said Intel will demonstrate Larabee in 2008, but didn't share launch plans.\nThe third area of focus is mobility. Intel wants to be part of whatever design becomes the most popular mobile device. Having shed its ambitions for mobile phones, it now plans to compete directly against the smart phone industry with the MID, sort of a handheld notebook PC that hasn't really attracted much interest as of yet.\nIn 2008 Intel will introduce Silverthorne, and beyond that an x86 processor called Moorestown for low-power devices like MIDs. There's no evidence at all that people want MIDs right now, but Otellini thinks that if Intel continues to reduce the power consumption of its chips, the designs and software for MIDs will continue to improve.\nThose devices will have to connect to the Internet somehow to compete against smart phones that use cellular networks for voice and data. And Intel thinks that network will be WiMax. The company is working with Sprint and Clearwire to get WiMax service going in the U.S., and it will hit Japan with WiMax as part of its joint venture with KDDI.\nSo that's what Otellini said. As always, it's interesting to note what he didn't say. He didn't mention Microsoft once during his presentation, at least that I noticed. He didn't mention Viiv or any of Intel's previous efforts to develop PCs for the living room. And Itanium seems to have finally crawled offstage, at least as far as the CEO is concerned. Keynote speeches later today from Pat Gelsinger and tomorrow from Dadi Perlmutter and Anand Chandrasekher might clear up some of those questions, but it's always interesting to see what the CEO's priorities are during one of his biggest speeches of the year.\nStay tuned for more coverage of IDF, including a talk later today with Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, and much more on the future of mobile devices tomorrow."

Our mission is to get laptops in the hands of children; it doesn't necessarily have to be our laptop.\"\nHe added that Intel's move does not spell out trouble for OLPC, because \"The world is big enough for us combined \u2013 and more.\"\nAssociates thought differently. He said that the downfall of OLPC is that it fails to recognize it must operate with a sharp business model in order to succeed in its idealistic goals.\n\"[OLPC] is not really clear on what it takes to produce massive quantities of these things, deliver them and then support them in the field,\" Kay said in a phone interview.\nHe explained that Intel has the advantage in this regard, because in selling 500,000 low-cost notebooks to Portugal, the company is creating a market for such devices. Thus, more Original Equipment Manufacturers will want to work with and provide for Intel, a company that understands how to operate a business, as opposed to OLPC, Kay said.\n\"Intel has very long range view of how they develop a market, and that's what they're doing,\" Kay said. \"It's competitive; this is how competitive companies operate, they have a goal.... They adjust to realities of the situation; they bring in partners; they come up with marketing strategy and campaigns.\"\nHowever, OLPC's president said his organization is satisfied that a new market has emerged as a result of its efforts. He said he'd like to keep seeing Intel and other manufacturers continue producing low-cost laptops, because it only furthers the organization's cause of providing computers to as many children as possible.\n\"What I'd like to see happen is an ecosystem develop here \u2013 similar to what's happened with iPods,\" Kane said. \"When Apple came out with that product, there were a lot of companies that surrounded the appliances of that product....We will be absolutely delighted to see people push innovation, because that's only going to translate to other parts of the world having that opportunity that they would've never had before.\""

Once I went to ragged school and they taught me Thou shalt not steal, and told me about God in heaven. I will not steal, sir, if my father kills me.\"\nThe friend said: \"I don't know what to do with you. Here is a shilling. I will see what we can do for you.\" The boy looked at it a minute, and then said: \"But please, sir, wouldn't you like to hear my little hymn?\" They marveled that a lad suffering from cold and hunger and bruises could sing a hymn; but they answered : \"Yes, we will hear you.\" And then in a low, sweet voice he sang, \"Gentle Jesus, meek and mild.\" At the conclusion he said : \"That's my little hymn. Good-by.\"\nNext morning they mounted the stairs again, knocking at the door, but there came no answer. They opened the door and went in. The shilling lay on the floor, and there too lay the boy dead, but with a brave smile on his face. He sleeps in the grave until that day when His \"Gentle Jesus\" will take him home to heaven."

It also would require banks to overhaul their mortgage servicing and foreclosure practices as well as include a component for \"principal write-downs,\" the reduction of mortgage debt for individual homeowners.\nGaining California's support for the deal would be a significant accomplishment for the administration, which in recent weeks has been trying to step up its aid for the beleaguered U.S. housing market. Monday is the deadline for individual states to either reject or accept a deal; that deadline was originally Friday and was pushed back to allow more time for the high-level negotiations.\nThe administration has been pushing hard for a settlement among state attorneys general, the nation's five largest mortgage servicers \u2014 Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc. and Ally Financial Inc. \u2014 and certain federal agencies. But several attorneys general have expressed skepticism over the deal.\nCalifornia Atty. Gen. Kamala D. Harris walked away from negotiations last year, saying the banks were asking for too much, including release from future potential legal action by the state.\nAs recently as two weeks ago, she called the potential $25-billion settlement inadequate for California.\nBut in a statement Sunday night, Harris said the door remained open for California to join.\n\"For the past 13 months we have been working for a resolution that brings real relief to the hardest-hit homeowners, is transparent about who benefits and will ensure accountability,\" Harris said. \"We are closer now than we've been before, but we're not there yet.\"\nA spokesman for the state attorney general's office declined further comment.\nA person familiar with the negotiations but not authorized to speak publicly confirmed that California was in direct talks with the Obama administration over joining a potential deal.\nState attorneys general have been talking with the nation's five biggest mortgage servicers for more than a year to secure a settlement after revelations of widespread foreclosure processing errors in 2010.\nOther key holdouts remain as the political stakes of the foreclosure talks have escalated. In his recent State of the Union speech, President Obama announced that he would step up efforts to find wrongdoing leading up to the mortgage meltdown.\nIn doing so, the administration appointed perhaps the most vociferous critic of the foreclosure settlement talks, New York Atty. Gen. Eric Schneiderman, to co-chair a new working group that combines efforts by federal and state authorities to probe mortgage fraud.\nSchneiderman has been critical of the multi-state foreclosure talks because, he has said, the banks have asked for too much release from future legal actions, potentially limiting broader investigations into Wall Street's role.\nAfter his appointment by Obama, Schneiderman signaled the foreclosure talks are moving in the right direction, but has not committed to signing on."

The disease has impacted mature sea stars and some juveniles of around a year old.\nUp to 90 per cent of sunflower starfish in parts of Howe Sound have died from an unknown wasting epidemic in the last month and Vancouver Aquarium scientists are trying to solve the mystery.\nDonna Gibbs, a research diver and taxonomist with the aquarium, said she got into the water at Bowyer Island and near Porteau Cove in Howe Sound and saw the decimation for herself. Other waters around Vancouver have also been impacted.\n\"In September, we started getting reports from divers and then we saw it ourselves. The divers were calling us and saying 'what's with all the dead sea stars?'... I got in there and it was spread out and they were just these gooey carcasses and it was 'Ok, something big is going on here,'\" Gibbs said.\n\"It's just amazing to me that there were thousands and now they're just gone. Like a wildfire. It's crazy.\"\nThe aquarium's marine diversity blog shows a video of the die-off before and after on Hutt Island, also in Howe Sound, with footage shot of the seabed in May 2012 showing a health mass population of thousands and footage shot of the same spot last month show no starfish at all.\n\"We thought it might be just the eastern side of the sound at first but then we started seeing it towards Popham Island as well,\" she said.\n\"We're monitoring it and trying to find out what is going on. It seems to us that it is probably a disease that just wiped them out... it hits the species in a big way.\"\nThey are tracking the epidemic by taking photos of the sunflower stars and other starfish species that have been impacted. The disease has impacted mature sea stars and some juveniles of around a year old. Sea stars live from three to five years.\nHealthy quarter-sized baby sunflower starfish have been spotted, Gibbs said, raising hopes of a recovery.\nThere were so many sunflower stars that the wider ecosystem was being smothered by them.\n\"There are known diseases for sunflower stars and we think it just hit them in their overabundance and just took off... We suspect it's a known disease, not something weird or freakish. It's just taking off because it can,\" Gibbs said.\n\"The situation could actually be healthy, because there were way too many of them. It may leave new room for settlement for new species and maybe the ecosystem will come back to the way it should be. So it's not necessarily bad but the thing is we don't know yet. We're monitoring where we've seen them, where divers have reported it and we're mapping the healthy babies.\nTaking a necropsy of the dead starfish to find the disease has not been easy.\n\"We brought some samples up and the scientists weren't happy with that because they disintegrated... they want five healthy and five diseased. When we went back out there we didn't know where we could find them because the dead ones were disintegrated and healthy ones just aren't there.\"\nVancouver Aquarium veterinarians have been in discussion with their counterparts around the world to find out more about the collapses of such starfish colonies but Gibbs said they wanted to gather and log their information before they collaborate with other scientists \"so we can talk the same talk.\"\n\"We're trying to figure out what's really going on. We're getting so much interest, with people talking about the Tsunami and (nuclear reactor meltdown at) Fukushima and people saying 'it's radiation.' And that the thing. It could be any number of reasons, so we're not making any definitive statements,\" Gibbs said.\nShe added that they did not know yet if the species was at risk.\n\"I hope not. We're going to really watch the babies and how they come back and the healthy ones. We're going to track all of it now,\" Gibbs said.\n\"Howe Sound is just coming back into balance again (after a major cleanup in the last decade) and this may be part of it. I don't know.\""

With filtered, averted vision at 64x, a very faint shell of even surface brightness was just visible. Using the OIII filter at 158x and averted vision, the disc was apparent but it still appeared faint with even surface brightness. Greg, Walt, Peter, and Mary observed it through my scope at both powers, filtered. Greg had it in his 18\u2033 dob too and with averted vision, it appeared as a faint, round disc of fairly even surface brightness with sharp edges.\nThis dark nebula is located just a little over a degree west of 50 Aquilae in a star rich area of the summer Milky Way. It extended east to west and was very opaque giving the impression that the area was mostly devoid of stars. The contrast between this area and the surrounding field which is teeming with stars is striking.\nThis dark nebula is located near Barnard 142 about 1 1/2\u00b0 west of 50 Aquilae and is a distinct dark patch in a heavily populated area of the Milky Way. This dark dust cloud is irregular shaped with dark lanes jutting out into the dense, surrounding star field to the west.\nAt 35x, the stars are of fairly similar magnitude with minor range in brightness, elongated in E-W position. The cluster is clearly detached from surrounding field. I counted 12 stars with 2 brightest stars in W and a circlet of stars to E. Three star chains extend from the circlet to the W. M71 is nearby, approx. 1/2 degree to SW.\nAt 64x, this looks like a long upside down V shape very similar to a very narrow arrowhead. Eight bright stars form the V shape which is elongated E-W.\nLocated in a densely populated area of the Summer Milky Way in Cygnus, PK 64+5.1 can be a challenging object to find. A short star hop from Albireo, it forms a triangle with 9 Cygni and 12 Cygni in a field teeming with stars.\nWhen compared to nearby field stars at 92x in an 18\u2033 Newtonian, this almost stellar-like object appeared as a bright, mag. 10, deep orange-red star with a small, faint, orange-tinged diffuse glow.\nWhen the magnification was increased to 170x and 227x, a small disk of uniform brightness was clearly visible, however, its pale orange tinge was lost. It did not respond to the UHC or OIII filters at any power. According to other visual observers, this object responds favorably to an H-Beta filter.\nThe beautiful orange-red coloured central star in PK 64+5.1 is visible in small aperture telescopes, however, you will probably need an 8\u2033 or larger aperture to resolve its shell.\nAt 35x, this cluster is detached from the surrounding field with a wide range of brightness in it stars. A triangle of bright stars frames the fainter members of this sparse, loose cluster.\nThe rich, brilliant blue and orange colors of its two brightest members drew my attention first as I found their color contrast beautiful. The third star of the triangle is a couple of magnitudes fainter and appeared whitish-blue to my eye. Inside the triangle, lies a chain of 4 stars oriented in a N-S position.\n12 Lyrae is the bright, orange star which forms the SE corner of the triangle. 11 Lyrae is the blue star which sits in the NW corner. And the fainter, white star is located in the southern end of the cluster, forming the 3rd corner of the triangle.\nLooked great at 64x too; 158x was too much power. I counted a dozen stars at 35x; 25 stars at 64x.\nLarge, bright, and compact in the finder and 10\u00d750 binoculars, this is a fine object in the telescope at low power. Detached from the surrounding star field, 35x revealed more than 30 stars of differing range in brightness. There are several nice groupings of stars with a chain of stars in the center.\nAt 64x, very faint, hazy, oval disk of nearly uniform brightness. Larger halo with averted vision. 128x did not provide additional detail.\nAt 64x, I can see why this is called the E.T. cluster. The 2 brightest stars form big eyes and the stars form a stick figure with an outstretched arm. This cluster is rich and compressed with stars varying in magnitude and color.\nAt 64x, large, dim, fuzzy halo. Sweeping outward from its central condensation, dark patches were noted in the overall dim, gray nebulosity. An overall haziness and mottling indicated where the arms were located, extending considerably outwards from the core. Very expansive.\nAt 64x, there were 2 prominent star groupings. At the left of the field was the first grouping consisting of 5 bright stars forming a semi-circle with a bright star lying off to the right and downward from the 4th right-most star in the circle. The second grouping of bright stars lay to the right of the FOV and reminded me of the shape of Lyra.\nAt 64x, a dozen stars bright stars were visible in this very loose open cluster. There was a scooper shaped asterism with 2 or 3 bright stars sitting in the bowl. There was an elongated \u201cV\u201d formation of bright stars to the SW.\nThis cluster was loose and detached from the surrounding field with a dozen bright stars at 64x. It formed a scooper shaped asterism with a few bright stars located in the scooper\u2019s bowl. I noticed an elongated boomerang shape of bright stars southwest of the cluster.\nHaving located the field with 64x, I replaced the 22mm Nagler with a 7.5mm Plossl and at 190x, I noted a 10th magnitude star engulfed in a bright patch of nebulosity which appeared triangular in shape to my eye and more discernable with averted vision.\nVery compact open cluster is located just to the south of M38. It is especially rich in stars and dense towards the western portion of the cluster. Very round shape with stars varying in magnitude from 9 to 12. This beautiful cluster\u2019s proximity to the more open and much closer M38 gives a perspective of the depth and dimension of Space.\nAfter centering M42 in the eyepiece and easily splitting Theta 0 and Theta 1 in the trapezium, I edged southward and located NGC 1999. At 190x, I noted a 10th magnitude star engulfed in a patch of nebulosity. At first glance, the patch was dim, but as I studied it longer, the nebulosity took on more life and became brighter, larger, and presented an annular shape similar to a planetary nebula.\nI found Zeta Ori in the Telrad and moved to the eyepiece. At 114x, I moved Zeta out of the field and sure enough, there was the nebulosity although it looked nothing like its famed flame shape. It looked more like an elongation of the brilliant glow generated by Zeta Orionis, a mag 1.8 star that competes for the attention of the observer.\nAt 64x, the cluster contains members of a wide range of brightness. In the center there is a box shaped asterism with double star in top left corner of the box. It has a curving arc of 2 stars moving up from the double star. There is a bright field star to the West. On the Eastern side there are 2 bright field stars and one is a lovely golden color.\nAt 64x, stars seemed to form a square shape in the center of the cluster. Two stars curve outwards from a double star that sits at one corner of the square. Towards the west lies a bright field star and along the Eastern edge is another pair of field stars: one is a beautiful golden color. The members of this cluster vary in their range of brightness.\nAt 64x, Vertical line of 5 stars, there\u2019s a cross asterism to the East. The members are of uneven brightness.\nThis lovely galactic cluster lies to the southwest of M35 and appears quite small in comparison and many magnitudes fainter than its brilliant Messier neighbor. At 64x, tiny, sparkling, pinpoints of light are situated closely together in a beautiful formation that is somewhat reminiscent of a globular cluster. Perhaps it has been the deprivation of viewing globular clusters during these long autumn and winter months that renders NGC 2158 somewhere in between an open cluster and a globular cluster to my eye. Or perhaps it is the contrast of its attention stealing neighbor, M35, whose distribution is more open, that produces this reaction in me. Interestingly, upon first glance, the cluster appeared circular in shape, however, with more scrutiny at 158x, I came to see the stars positioned in more of a triangular formation which I imagined looking almost comet-like in appearance. Feelings of the depth of space surfaced as I admired this object and thought about how it contrasted with M35. This object obviously lies much farther away than M35 and I wondered what it would look like if was closer. It would undoubtedly lose its charming globular cluster characteristic. And I imagine the stars would appear much more brilliant and colorful. Yes, I could even envision it competing gloriously with M35 for the attention of the observer and perhaps winning!\nThis very loose open cluster consists of 20-30 stars with several bright stars forming the shape of a fir tree. Near the trunk of the tree is a small dipper shaped asterism. At the Northern end of the cluster, the bright star, 15 S Monocerotis, looked bluish-white in color, to my eye.\nAt 64x, this was a delightful surprise as it was the most heavily populated and tightest open cluster I observed tonight and a welcome change from the sparse clusters I\u2019d been observing. There is a semi-circle formation of bright stars with a string of bright stars crossing diagonally through the middle, NW-SE. There\u2019s quite a bit of dark area in between. On the Eastern edge there is a bright and beautiful kite asterism. There are multiple sets of double stars in the kite asterism area. I counted approximately 30 stars.\nAt 64x, this open cluster was a bright, large grouping of approximately 30 stars that formed an asterism of an airplane. A long winding chain of 8th, 9th, and 10th magnitude stars extended from the Northern end of the cluster to the Southern tip forming the wing span. The body of the plane consisted of the bright, dense core of bright stars located in the center of the cluster.\nIn close proximity to this cluster and complimenting it quite nicely, is a lovely tight, row of three 11th magnitude stars just to its North: H 148.1640, H148.1660, H148.2129. Nearby and to the West of the cluster, is a more spaciously separated row of three 7th magnitude stars \u2013 Hip32608, HIP32596, HIP 32572 \u2013 which contrasted very nicely with the 11th magnitude grouping.\nAt 64x, very loose, cluster. There\u2019s an \u201cS\u201d asterism, a long line of 6 bright stars strung N-S along western edge, and dark lanes running through the cluster.\nAn \u201cS\u201d asterism and several dark lanes caught my attention at 64x. I counted 6 bright stars snaking their way through this loose cluster, running north to south, along the western edge. Very nice.\nIn the same field as the double star 63 Geminorum. At 64x, this planetary nebula mimicked a very bright, bluish star with a small halo around it. A closer look at 158x revealed a central star surrounded by a bright halo that permeated outwards in a somewhat mottled, gray, hazy, glow. A bright star was located adjacent to the planetary in the 3:00 position.\nThis planetary nebula is located in the same field as the double star 63 Geminorum. At 64x, it appeared as a blinking nebula. With direct vision, I noted a very bright, bluish star which brightened with averted vision with a small halo was detected. A closer look at 158x revealed a central star surrounded by a bright halo that was annular shaped and permeated outwards in a somewhat mottled, gray, hazy, glow.\nAt 64x, There is a box asterism to NE and a horizontal line of 3 stars to the West. I counted a dozen stars. Very loose cluster of fairly uniform brightness.\nAt first glance using 64x, the galaxy appeared quite large, rectangular shaped, fairly faint, with the brightest portions stretching E-W. There were 3 stars superimposed on the halo which formed a line running E-W through the galaxy. Further examination at 190x revealed its oval shape of fairly even brightness near the core but becoming more irregular towards the edges. I suppose this is why it appeared rectangular at first glance. The well defined eastern and western edges of the galaxy decreased in brightness beginning near the boundaries defined by the bright superimposed stars. There was an uneven decrease in brightness along the southern and northern edges. I also noted a triangle of 3 stars directly above the western edge of the galaxy.\n64x revealed a lineup of two 7th magnitude stars at a slight angle and to the West of this object. 158x revealed a hazy, glowing halo, however, this globular cluster is unresolvable. It is located at a remarkable distance of 300,000 ly.\nThis cluster was bright and loosely structured in an oblong shape at 64x. There were a few bright 5th, 6th, and 7th magnitude members towards the center of the cluster, sparkling more brilliantly than the stars of lesser magnitude that surrounded them. The placement of these stars emphasized the large range in magnitude in the cluster.\nThis object lies in the northern part of the open cluster M46. It appeared as a ghostly circular wisp at 115x with an unfiltered view and it is easy to see how it could be missed if you weren\u2019t specifically looking for it under these skies. When I moved the Ultrablock between my eye and the eyepiece, the planetary nebula popped into view. It was very well defined with sharp edges and seems to be fairly large. It was a smoky, grayish-white color and circular in shape. At 190x, with averted vision I suspected annularity due to a tinge of darkening within its edges. A central star was not noted.\nAt 64x, this loosely populated open cluster consisted of few members of varying magnitudes that were arranged fairly uniformly by magnitude. The cluster, itself, appeared triangular in shape with a bright chain of stars running down the middle in a N-S direction which gave it a somewhat beveled, three dimensional appearance. There were several empty dark areas that were interweaved among the star chains which contributed to the cluster\u2019s textured, dimensional appearance.\nLarge, bright, and oval positioned in a NE-SW orientation with direct vision, at 64x. A bright, elliptical, compact core with extended halo was revealed with direct vision at 158x and the nucleus appeared stellar in the bright core with averted vision, while the halo had a grainy texture.\nAt 64x, this irregular galaxy was located in the same FOV as M81. This elongated, oval, gray sliver extended in a SW-NE position. Very large, very bright, with diffuse halo and some mottling along the edges of the sliver.\nI was only able to see this galaxy with averted vision and even then, it appeared mostly stellar to my eye. A satellite went through the FOV as I was observing this galaxy.\nAt 64x, small, faint, oval with bright center. 158x, well-defined bright core with diffuse halo.\nThis was very bright with direct vision. Located next to a bright amber field star to the South. Compact, circular core with large grainy halo. The galaxy looked circular with a slight elongation to in an E-W orientation.\nAt 64x, bright, round core, with diffuse halo. Nucleus very bright, stellar.\nM108 appeared dim, thin, and needle-shaped elongated E-W at 64x and at 284x with direct vision. Averted vision extended its size a bit more. Curious as to how this compared to M82, I quickly centered it in the eyepiece at 64x. In fact, M81 and M82 were in the same FOV at 64x. The difference in surface brightness between M108 and M82 was obvious at first glance. M82 was extraordinarily bright, large, had a core with fairly well defined edges and a diffuse halo, stunning. Is there an edge-on galaxy that rivals its beauty?\nAt 284x, with direct vision, the galaxy appeared dim and elongated with considerable brightening toward the center. The bright nuclear region was almost stellar in areas while the small, faint halo extended unevenly outward in an E-W direction. Averted vision extended the size of the halo a bit more. There was a bright star located to its E.\nAt 64x, it has a pretty bright, compact, circular core that extends a bit in an ENE-WSW orientation. At 284x, the stellar core had sharp edges with a diffuse halo that eased outwards significantly from the core becoming fainter as it did so. NGC 3384 is in the same FOV to the NE.\nWith direct vision at 64x, it appeared bright with a roundish core that extended in a ENE-WSW orientation. 158x with averted vision revealed a stellar nucleus, a condensed core with well defined edges, and a diffuse halo that grew gradually fainter as it eased outwards into the background.\nAt 64x, this galaxy is in the same FOV as M105 which lies to its SW. Direct vision revealed a large, bright, oval-shaped, granular looking core. It was smaller in dimension than M105. At 284x, the core had a roundish shape with sharp, well defined edges elongated N-S which appeared mostly uniform in brightness. The halo was diffuse, extending outwards from the core.\nAt 158x, this galaxy had a bright core with a stellar nucleus and a diffuse halo. It was elongated in a N-S orientation. There were 2 pretty, soft yellow, field stars to its west and southwest.\nVisible with direct vision at 158x. Located in a field of 4 stars kind of forming a kind of square, not really rectangular, more like a square with uneven side. It is located between 2 of those stars along the western side of the square. Overall, it appears very diffuse, nebulous, and elliptical shaped. Closer scrutiny with averted vision revealed a bright stellar core surrounded by a grainy textured halo that extends SW-NE. A satellite passed through the FOV as I was observing this object.\nThis galaxy was located in the neighborhood of NGC 3623 and NGC 3627. At 64x, it was significantly dimmer than its neighbors. The core was faint, thin, and needle shaped oriented E-W. Best seen with averted vision.\nI was not able to see it at all using direct vision at any power. And I was unable to detect it with averted vision at 64x. At 158x and with averted vision, I was just barely able to make it out. As my eyes adapted, I was eventually able to discern a very faint compact core with a small diffuse halo. Higher powers washed it out and were useless. I could not see it at 115x or 190x with the Pl\u00f6ssls either.\nAt 64x, this was visible with direct vision. It was nestled to the east and below the second star of a vertical line of 3 stars. At 158x, with averted vision, it appeared to have fairly uniform surface brightness and was elongated in a N-S orientation.\nThis galaxy was visible with direct vision at 64x. It was best viewed at 158x which revealed a bright compact core that gradually became diffuse and extended outwards into an oval shape that was positioned in a NE-SW orientation.\nAt 64x, oval, elongated E-W with stars superimposed on the halo.\nThis was visible with direct vision at 64x. It was located close to NGC 3898 and at 158x, its oval, grainy surface stretched N-S.\nAt 64x, this looked like a star at first glance, but further observation at 158x, revealed a small, compact, bright core with a long thin halo that extended significantly beyond the core in N-S orientation. Very easy and large at 158x.\nBright, large, and elongated in a NW-SE orientation at 64x with direct vision. Pushing the power up 158x, direct vision revealed a bright, oval core with sharp edges surrounded by a large, elliptical shaped halo. With averted vision, a stellar nucleus was detected. There is a pretty double star which lies NE of the galaxy. The contrast in magnitude of the two stars makes the double striking as the primary is a few magnitudes brighter than its companion.\nEnormous at 158x! Direct vision revealed a large, elongated, diffuse halo that extends considerably from the well defined core which appeared oval in shape. A well defined, bright, circular nucleus with sharp edges was well delineated inside the bright core. The core also had well defined edges which was an overall oval shape and had a grainy looking texture. Both the core and halo stretched in N-S orientation. The size of the galaxy appeared to grow with time spent observing it using direct and averted vision. A field star located to the S and another to the N form a line with the galaxy in the middle.\nAt 158x, pretty bright, large with stellar core and diffuse towards the edges.\nVery bright, large, diffuse and roundish in shape.\n158x with direct vision revealed a large, elongated, well-defined, halo extending E-W. The halo is brilliant with the dust lane at the southern end. Several bright field stars were visible at 64x to the west.\nThis galaxy was large, bright, and oval positioned in a WSW-ENE orientation with direct vision, at 125x. A bright, elliptical, compact core with sharp edges and extended halo was revealed with direct vision. The nucleus appeared stellar in the bright core with averted vision, while the halo had a grainy texture.\nAppears diffuse and oval of fairly even surface brightness at 158x.\nThis globular cluster was bright and circular with direct vision, at 90x. Direct vision at 200x resolved individual stars at the core whereas the halo appeared mottled with few outlier chains.\nDiffuse and round at 158x with averted vision with stars unresolved in 10\u2033 Dob.\nBright core with very small, compact, faint halo at 64x. 158x showed more of the halo but still fairly compact. A member of the M101 Galaxy group.\nAt 64x, small, diffuse, circular, faint tiny halo. Increasing the power to 158x did not reveal additional detail. A member of the M101 Galaxy group.\nBright core with diffuse, elongated halo in E-W orientation at 158x.\nAt 64x, elongated in a N-S orientation and very small, very faint with slightly brighter core.\nVery small, faint, diffuse, and slightly elongated at 64x and 158x.\nSubstitute for duplicate of M101.\nSmall of medium, overall surface brightness. It is brighter towards the center and has an oval, diffuse halo that is elongated in a NW-SE position.\nAt 158x elongated N-S, with 2-3 bright knots in the halo region and bulging towards the center.\nBright, round, small halo with core that appeared stellar at 64x. At 158x, the halo appears a bit elongated with a bright, round core.\nAt 115x, small, faint, condensed, of fairly even surface brightness. At 158x, fairly condensed with gradual brightening towards the center with a few stars resolved around its halo.\nSmall, bright core that was unresolvable and granular at any power.\nThis galaxy was located near M13. Direct vision revealed a stellar core surrounded by a diffuse halo that extended in a NE-SW orientation.\nAt 90x, it appeared compact with a bright nonstellar core and grainy halo. 200x did not resolve individual stars at the core.\nBright, small core at 64x. Individual stars unresolved at 158x too.\nThis globular cluster was small with a distinct core. Unable to resolve individual stars. Although a bit brighter at the core, the halo was fuzzy.\nAt low powers this PN appeared slightly elongated, however at higher power an irregular shaped annularity was noted, although I was unable to discern the central star at 284x w/OIII with averted vision. The halo appeared to be of irregular surface brightness with the brightest component lying towards the Northern edge.\nAt 64x, appears fairly compressed and triangular shaped with dark region preceeding. 115x resolves more stars and a dark lane runs through the cluster in a N-S orientation.\nBright, circular in shape with 3 dark lanes at 64x. Brighter towards the center and diffuse at the edges. A dozen stars are discernable in the nebula.\nVery sparse, not well concentrated but quite bright at 35x. The stars are brightest towards the southern and western ends of the cluster. I counted 2 dozen stars at 35x. Increasing the power to 64x did not improve the view.\nAt 40x, this is a small, loose, irregular OC comprised of a few dozen stars elongated and spread out unevenly in SW-NE orientation. 64x draws out more stars which draw the eye in curving patterns. One brighter grouping of stars curves up towards the South like a pointer.\nDiffuse halo and central star visible with direct vision at 158x. Appeared to have a greenish tint with OIII filter.\nAt 158x, this globular cluster was pretty faint, fuzzy, and granular in texture with some brightening towards the core. Unable to resolve it down to stars.\nAt 64x, irregular shaped cluster of approx. 40 stars. Somewhat compressed near the center around the 2 brightest stars. Not well detached from the surrounding field and NGC 6756 is a half degree to the North in the same field at low power. Four stars form a bright, large, square-ish shape towards the SE edge of cluster. There is an interesting looking arc of 4-5 bright stars towards the West and there\u2019s also a nice triplet lined up to NW.\nThis cluster is small and bright with with a dozen bright stars in an irregular shape at 64x. Not well detached from the surrounding star field with NGC 6755 within the same 1 degree field. It is somewhat compressed towards the center with small clusterings of stars forming a curving chain.\nThis looked like a fuzzy star at 64x with direct vision. Using averted vision at the same power, the halo expands greatly. At 158x with OIII filter and direct vision, a star is involved with the annular shaped halo. The surface brightness of the ring is uneven with a bright knot along its Southern edge.\nThis open cluster looked exactly like the photos when viewed through my 7\u00d750 finderscope. I was not able to view it in it\u2019s entirety through my lowest power eyepiece at 64x. To be revisited.\nAt 35x, 4 bright stars form a curving hook at the top of the \u201cCoathanger\u201d with 6 bright stars lined up E-W forming its base. North of the bottom of the hanger is a small bright curve of stars forming a semi-circle. The coathanger asterism looked best through my 7\u00d750 finderscope.\nAt 35x, this large open cluster elongated in an E-W orientation. Does not have central concentration and is detached from the surrounding field. Stars range in brightness with the brightest stars forming a figure 8. A line of bright stars forms a NW-SE slash thru the middle of the FOV. At 64x, the western portion has several bright stars widely scattered about. Towards the eastern portion is a grouping of stars, it\u2019s more concentrated here with pairs and small groupings of stars clustered together. North and South of this are dark areas. I preferred the view at 35x. The dark areas I noticed near 6823 turned out to be the dark clouds of emission nebula NGC 6820. I did not notice the bright areas of the emission nebula.\nAt 35x w/Ultrablock, a blue central star with a small, round, bright, halo which blinked out with direct vision was noted. At 84x both unfiltered and w/OIII, the bright circular disk was visible. At 158x w/OIII, the bluish halo appeared slightly elongated in a SE-NW orientation. Using a 2x barlow with a 7.5mm Plossl, the halo appeared to become diffuse along the periphery of its outer edges while the inner area of the bright elliptical halo still appeared uniformly illuminated. The blinking effect was noted with direct vision at all powers except with 7.5mm.\nThis cluster is detached from the surrounding field and consists of stars of varying magnitudes. At 64x, the brightest stars of the cluster\u2019s weak concentration consists of a cross or X asterism. Five bright stars form a N-S line with 4 bright stars intersecting in an E-W line. A long, wide curve of bright stars forms a semi-circle to the SE of the X asterism.\nAt 35x, the cross asterism looks fuzzy with 6 bright stars intersecting one another, the arc of stars to the SE is readily apparent. 4 stars curve E-W in an outlier chain below the X asterism.\n158x really draws out detail in the X asterism with 8 stars in NW-SE orientation and 6 intersecting. I counted about 25 stars at this magnification. Best view was at 64x.\nAt 64x small, condensed, 5-10 faint stars. 158x resolves 20+ stars.\nWithout the Ultrablock, the size and brightness of the Dumbbell Nebula was significant at 129x but was lacking in definition and had an overall fuzzy, circular shape. With the UltraBlock, it tapered toward the middle and widened at both ends.\nAt 64x, 20-25 stars visible but not well detached from rich Milky Way star field. Two small chains of brighter stars form a V.\nAt 64x, it appeared small, bright, and irregular shaped, of varying range in magnitude. A clustering of 3 bright stars grabbed my attention first before moving on to look at the fainter stars. This cluster is located adjacent to NGC 6885 and was not well detached. It was difficult to determine where one cluster ended and the other began due to the way the stars are scattered about.\nAt 64x, this cluster was large and bright with a bright blue star near the center. There were many fainter stars surrounding it. The cluster is only slightly compressed and not well detached from NGC 6882. It is better detached along the western and northern edges. I estimated around 50+ stars.\nEveryone agreed that this was the highlight of the evening for the Herschel objects we observed. It was large, rich, compressed, and detached from surrounding star field at 64x. I estimated that there were nearly 100 stars. The cluster was beautiful, appearing as a large sprinkling of stars of mostly similar magnitude contrasting against the black background of Space. Stars appeared somewhat clustered along wide star chains running E-W through the center of the cluster, demarcated by dark lanes.\nAt 64x w/Ultrablock, this rich blue nebula has well defined edges, quite large, quite bright, and oblong in shape. At 158x w/OIII, it lost its nearly uniform bright appearance and now looked unevenly illuminated with the Eastern portion being brightest and the W edges became less defined and mottled. I began to think my eye was playing a trick on me and popped in the 5mm w/OIII for a better look. At this higher power, I definitely noticed a dark protrusion a little more than midway through the western portion of the nebula with mottling throughout the fainter W edge. At 64x w/Ultrablock, I noted a bright star to the S of the nebula and another to its N nearly exactly opposite the star flanking its southern side. A third star is visible W of the nebula. At 158x and 284x, the 3 stars form a triangle and if you draw an imaginary line that connects these 3 stars, the nebula is sitting on one of lines in between 2 of them.\nAt 64x, the stars in this cluster vary in their range of brightness. The majority are faint with only a few bright stars sprinkled around the cluster. The cluster is fairly well detached from the surrounding field and somewhat compressed. There is a bright Y-shaped asterism that stands out among the fainter members. A bright star is located at bottom of the Y with another one closer to the V portion.\nAt 64x, small, round, bright core with direct vision expands in size with averted vision. At 158x, the core and halo are better defined with some mottling; most likely stars that were just at the threshold of resolution with averted vision.\nObserved holding UHC filter to binocs, nearby pelican nebula also visible.\nAt 64x, small, fuzzy with bright core; individual stars unresolved. At 158x, slightly irregular shaped and with averted vision somewhat elongated in a N-S orientation.\nVisible at 64x without filter with averted vision: irregular shaped. At 158x visible directly and with OIII filter the oval shape is more defined and mottled.\nFaint, compressed with few stars and fairly detached, at 64x. 8-10 stars resolved at 158x.\nFairly well detached from field with brighter 2-star groupings at 64x forming an irregular ring shape. Averted vision at 158x resolves more faint stars.\nAt 64x, this cluster was large, bright, irregular shaped, moderately compressed and fairly well detached from the surrounding star field. Although the many brighter stars caught my attention first, there are many fainter members populating this cluster too. I counted 40+ stars forming star chains, circlets, with a few dark areas interspersed through the cluster rendering it interesting to explore. There is a very pretty bright yellow star located to the NW.\nLarge, bright, irregular shaped, poorly compressed, and not well detached from the surrounding star field at 64x. I counted 20-25 stars of fairly similar magnitude: the majority are bright with only a few fainter stars.\nAt 64x, bright, small, detached, and not condensed. I counted a dozen star with the cluster members ranging in magnitude. There is a bright yellow star to E.\nBright, large, with diffuse halo extended E-W. The core is roundish and brightens towards the center where it is nearly stellar at 158x. There is a bright field star to the E.\nAt 158x, the core is bright with stellar nucleus and extensive halo stretching N-S. 2 bright stars are located to the East.\nAppears pretty faint, diffuse, and oval of fairly even surface brightness at 158x.\nAt 158x, diffuse, faint, and elongated with fairly even surface brightness oriented N-S.\n64x revealed a bright, blue ball of even surface brightness and well-defined edges. Using an UltraBlock filter enhanced the blue tones but did not draw out additional detail.\nThe outer edges showed some brightening and its shape was subtly less symmetrical using averted vision at 158x with an O-III filter. With direct vision it was turquoise and round in shape.\nOblong and elongated SE-NW, dimming towards the center was suspected using averted vision at 256x w/O-III. Aquamarine with direct vision, shades of green dominated the blues.\nColor was lost at 512x w/OIII and averted vision and a slightly darker center was suspected due to dimming that looked unevenly illuminated and mottled. Pale hues of blue and green were just barely visible with filtered direct vision.\nAt 64x, very faint, hazy, oval disk of nearly uniform brightness. Larger halo with averted vision. 128x did not provide additional detail. One of two companion galaxies of the Andromeda galaxy, M31.\nBright, compact core with fuzzy, diffuse halo edges. It appeared more circular than elliptical at 64x with slight N-S elongation. One of two companion galaxies of the Andromeda galaxy, M31.\nVisible by unaided eye. 128x revealed a very bright core nestled in a field of haze. I suspected that it was extending beyond my FOV so I moved the telescope and a very bright, circular M32 popped into view. At 64x, the bright, soft oval of M31 was flanked on either side by M110 and M32 in the same FOV. The edges of M31 were better delineated with averted vision and it\u2019s elliptical nature became more apparent.\nLying 2 degrees to the south-southeast of Delta Cassiopeiae, this cluster is rich, bright, large and compressed with stars varying in magnitude and color. Yellow supergiant Phi Cassiopeiae shines brightest at 5th magnitude forming a wide double with a blue companion. Two chains of stars extend to the east and southwest with several doubles scattered throughout. At 64x, I can see why this is referred to as the E.T. cluster. The 2 brightest stars are the eyes with two star chains forming a stick figure whose outstretched arm contains a deep orange M-class red giant.\nAt 64x, detached, triangular shaped, few stars of varying range in brightness.\nAt 64x, large, dim, fuzzy halo. Sweeping outward from its central condensation, dark patches were noted in an overall dim, gray nebulosity. A hazy mottling indicated where the arms were located, extending considerably outwards from the core. Expansive.\nAt 64x, faint, diffuse, and circular shaped.\nFrom gamma And over to mu And over to 51 And over to M76, the Little Dumbbell in Perseus. At 129x I noticed a dark lane near the center with white-ish wisps to either side. I attached the UltraBlock filter which defined its structure more clearly. It looked like an irregularly shaped rectangle with mottled blotches of darkness running across and through one end. The brighter edge appeared to have a star embedded in the top corner when viewed using averted vision. The two smaller hazy patches on either side of the rectangle looked like small satellites separated from the rectangle by dark area.\nAt 64x, detached, loose, bright cluster of stars in a sparse star field. Located between Algol and Almach.\nWhen I first glanced at this at 64x, it looked like a faint, hazy, grainy textured smudge. I put in the 9mm for a closer look but I preferred the view with the 22mm due to poor seeing conditions. The arms extending from the core gave the galaxy a slightly elongated structure, yet, it retained more of a circular than oval shape.\nAt 114x this object was distinctively wedge shaped with noticeable edges. It was small, fuzzy, whitish-gray, and triangular-shaped reminiscent of a comet! Unsurprisingly, luminosity degraded moving outwards from the nucleus.\nAt 64x, this group had members of varying brightness with 9 bright stars and 6 faint ones. There was a curved chain of bright stars with the bottom of the curve oriented towards the North. There is a triangle of stars to the South.\nAt 64x, this very bright open cluster is strewn with few stars that form a prominent V-shape. Initially, I was expecting an obvious delineation of well-defined and localized nebulosity, however, upon more scrutiny, it appeared as though the entire area was bathed in the soft nebulosity of IC 410. There is a lovely, brilliant yellow star positioned NE of the cluster whose color is quite striking.\nAt 64x, the group is very loose with a wide \u201cU\u2019 shaped asterism towards the South. There are also 2 bright stars in a vertical line to the South. There\u2019s a rectangular formation of 7 stars to the North. Small triangle of stars to the West which is very pretty. The triangle is very small and tight.\nDistinctively visible at 64x as a small, fuzzy, gray, circular object. Pushing the power to 114x and again to 158x enlarged the view without additional resolution. The view deteriorated and became blurry using the 5mm Radian for 284x and was best viewed at 190x with a 7.5mm Sirius Pl\u00f6ssl which accentuated the halo and enabled resolution of the outermost stars and those in laying in its periphery. The center was quite bright and I was able to discern some mottling which looked like fine dark spikes interjected haphazardly into its edges which I attributed, at the time, to the dark lanes laying between chains of stars.\nLike M37, this cluster contained a lot more stars than M36 \u2013 about twice as many but it is much smaller than M37. At 64x, this cluster was very pretty but, to my eye, 129x really drew out an asterism of an old-fashioned keyhole formed by its brightest stars. Dark lanes were embedded in the portion of the asterism where one would place the key. The very center contained some bright stars which reminded me of being in a dark hallway, and seeing the light emanating from the keyhole.\nBright and irregularly populated with dark lanes and bright star chains. The southern portion is more densely populated than the north. There is a bright chain of stars that points towards the North.\nWith the unfiltered view at 64x, I saw a large, bright, whitish, oblong and irregularly shaped ghostly, wispy, glow interspersed with dark area protruding ever so minutely into its edges. The Ultrablock helped to brightened the object but did not make a significant difference tonight. 158x did not provide additional detail.\nThe nebula was bright and enormous, becoming darker and better defined with the Orion Ultrablock filter attached. It looks like a huge \u201cwing\u201d that eventually narrows into a point. At 64x, it nearly occupied the 1 degree FOV. In the central region of the nebula, the Trapezium, 4 stars were visible. Barlowed at 129x, the stars were better resolved and swimming in misty pools of nebulae.\nThis loose grouping of stars contained 3 very bright stars towards the East. To their West is Sigma Orionis which is a very pretty quadruple star system. The bright white primary star has 3 fainter companion stars which looked white with a hint of blue to my eye. The 4 stars are of a range in magnitudes which make it so beautiful to observe. There is also a very pretty lineup of three stars nearby to the West of Sigma Orionis.\nBright, mostly roundish with somewhat of a comma shape to it. Stars superimposed. Dark region.\nI located M78 above Orion\u2019s belt and at 64x, the nebula was bright and for the most part round. One side was brighter with more definition and stars while the opposite side eventually faded into the surrounding star field. There were a few bright stars nearby.\nMy first impression at 64x was that of an octopus asterism. I counted approx. 40 stars which appeared grouped in chains. There was a predominant oval formation of stars which I saw as the head of the octopus with chains of stars combined with dark lanes which flowed outward forming its legs. 129x drew out the dark lanes and the asterism morphed into a spider with spindly legs and large body.\nAt 64x, the contrast between the quantity of stars just viewed in M36 with the volume of stars in this one was notable. Containing approximately 2-3 times the number of stars I saw in M36, their density was what made the most impression on me. At 129x, this cluster was even more pleasing to view with the color of the bright star near the center enhancing its appeal. Dark lanes are visible flowing through scores of beautiful, twinkling pinpoints of light.\nOne of my favorites. Diamonds on black velvet, salt and pepper. A large grouping of stars of primarily uniform brightness sparkling against a black background with a lovely colored bright star near the center.\nFairly evenly populated at 64x, approx. 75 stars with small range in magnitude. Although a dark lane runs E-W through the cluster. There is a U-shaped asterism formed by several 7th and 8th magnitude stars. Strewn along the top of the U are curving star chains. NGC 2158 is located to the southwest.\nAt 64x, this is a loose cluster with a backwards \u201cJ\u201d asterism; a horizontal line of 3 stars at the eastern edge of this cluster. The members have varying degrees in brightness; not uniform.\nI located the variable star, R Monocerotis with the Telrad and moved to the eyepiece. At 158x, I was delighted to see the bright, fuzzy, wedge shaped object. This comet shaped object is composed of a star which mimics the nucleus of a comet while the nebula fans northward similar to a comet\u2019s tail.\nThere were several bright groupings of stars in chains that appeared to radiate outward from the center. The very center of the star cluster was densely populated and contained a concentration of several bright stars. Flowing outward from this core were multiple star chains that were curved in shape. Occasional dark lanes were randomly interspersed among the star chains. This combination of components produced a very pleasing pattern of alternating dark lanes and star chains which, at 64x, reminded me of a child\u2019s pinwheel. I estimated a count of approximately 60 stars with several high magnitude stars clumped together in double and multiple star groupings.\nI counted a half dozen mag. 8 stars among approximately 40 or so fairly bright stars in this cluster. There is a very large, U-shaped, chain of bright stars at the NW edge of this open cluster. It reminded me of a champagne glass. The top of the glass faces the Northwest straight-on. Several bright stars run West to East from the top of the glass forming its stem \u2013 these stars lie in the center of the star cluster. A few stars float inside the top of this \u201cchampagne glass\u201d like fizzy bubbles of champagne!\nThis cluster was bright and loosely structured in an oblong shape which was very pretty to behold at 64x. There were a few bright 5th, 6th, and 7th magnitude members towards the center of the cluster, sparkling more brilliantly than the stars of lesser magnitude that surrounded them. The placement of these stars emphasized the large range in magnitude in the cluster and was interesting to note, yet, not as pleasing to me as was the more consistent pattern I observed in M46.\n64x revealed a lovely, densely populated open cluster consisting of many scores of stars. The members of the cluster appeared to be positioned in close proximity to one another with minor ranges in magnitude. The shape of the cluster is roughly that of a circle with few dark lanes and star chains deviating from the even uniformity of the group. Overall, the cluster looks like diamond dust exquisitely glittering in its ebony showcase.\nAt 64x, the cluster is bright and angular shaped with dark wedges created by a lack of stars in the NW and SW portions of the cluster. It is elongated in a NW-SW direction with the clustering of stars coming to a point in the N, E, S, and W corners thus giving it a fleshed-out X shape like a butterfly! It is located in a rich star field.\nOverall, this cluster is loosely grouped and large, spilling out beyond my 1 degree FOV. I counted approximately 50 stars and noted one very colorful golden, more yellowish than orange, star: 39 Cancri which was coupled with a brilliant white SAO 80336. I noted an asterism that roughly mimicked Cepheus. Forming the slightly distorted square of the base of the house were: SAO 98030, SAO 98032, SAO 98021, and Epsilon 41 Cancri. Forming the triangular roof of the house were SAO 98021 and Epsilon 41 Cancri which marked the top of the square and the base of the triangle. H1395.2711 and SAO 98010 formed the tip of the triangle.\nAt 64x, I noted a chain of stars in the shape of a very wide letter U. A bright chain of stars ran from the Western end of the cluster and continues towards the E with an eventual curve towards the South. It then continues southward for a while before gentling curving back up towards the West again. This cluster is very bright and large with a nice range of magnitudes and lots of star chains.\nAt 64x, this spiral galaxy was located in the same FOV as M82. Reminiscent of M31, it appeared as a very large, very bright, fuzzy patch with a bright core and diffuse halo. It appears mostly circular in shape but with some elongation stretching a bit in a N-S direction giving it an oval shape. The granularity of the halo ebbed outwards in all directions with uneven and decreasing brightness from the bright central core.\nFaint at 64x. I located M81 which appeared as a slightly elongated, fuzzy oval. It appeared best with the Barlow at 128x. The nucleus appeared slightly brighter than the rest of the halo. I was unable to resolve the arms of the spiral.\nAt 64x, bright, large, core with stellar nucleus. Diffuse halo is extended NW-SE.\nThe nebula was quite large, bright, and circular without a filter at 64x. With the unfiltered view at 284x, I noticed the dark area of the eyes but I was not able to discern additional detail in that area. I attached the OIII and the eyes were still just barely detectable. In fact, I did not see the eyes as the authors of various books describe them with a luminous bar separating them or the object divided into 4 components. That was not my experience. What I saw, was a hint of a difference in the *uniformity* of the luminosity of nebula in the area where the eyes are reported to be; just barely discernable with careful observation. As I looked more intently, the bluish-green nebula blinked out and I found myself looking at a star. I think that the nebula actually hides more than one star and perhaps the star I saw was one of brighter magnitude in that area, although maybe it was the mag 14 central star. The filtered view was best.\nDirect vision at 64x, revealed a bright, condensed core. Direct vision at 158x revealed a nonstellar core that was slightly elongated in a N-S orientation with averted vision. A diffuse and somewhat unevenly mottled halo extended from the well defined core edges until it eventually faded in with the background. NGC 3627 which was in the same FOV at 64x.\nThe galaxy was noticeable with direct vision at 64x. It is pretty bright with a compact core, although not as large as NGC 3627 which was in the same FOV. At 284x, the nonstellar, core had a roundish shape, that was elongated N-S. While the core had sharp edges, the halo was diffuse and eased outwards significantly from the core becoming fainter.\nDirect vision at 64x revealed a bright core with halo. At 158x, the core was condensed, nonstellar with sharply defined edges elongated in a N-S orientation. The halo appeared diffuse and mottled with uneven brightening and extended a good bit outwards from the core. NGC 3623 was in the same FOV.\nAt 64x with direct vision revealed a large, bright, granular core. A smaller, bright, NGC 3623 was in the same FOV. At 284x, the core had a roundish shape with sharp, well defined edges elongated N-S. The halo was diffuse, also extending outwards significantly from the core with variations in brightness around the circumference. The arms were not resolvable yet the characteristics seen in the halo gave a sense of their presence.\nThis galaxy was not visible at 64x, however at 158x, it was visible with averted vision. It appeared granular and diffuse, very faint, and was elongated in a NE-SW orientation. It was lost at higher power with the 7.5mm and 5mm eyepieces. I was not able to see it at 115x with the 12.5mm Plossl either.\nThis was very difficult; visible at 158x with averted vision only. It was very faint, very small, and diffuse. There\u2019s a triangle of 3 bright stars to the East.\nLarge, diffuse, elongated halo extending NW-SE. Bright, irregular, mottled nucleus.\nBright, large and elongated halo that is oriented in an E-W position. The core is very bright and roundish.\nVery bright, large, diffuse, elongated N-S.\nA well defined, uniformly round nucleus with sharp edges at 158x. Pretty large, pretty bright with a condensed granular core.\nVery bright, large, diffuse, and circular in shape.\nAt 64x this edge-on is bright extending E-W. Better at 158x, thin and needle shaped with well-defined edges.\nSimilar to M84 in size and brightness at 158x. Circular, fuzzy patch with a grainy-textured, compact core that diffuses evenly outwards.\nBright, elliptical in shape, extending N-S with compact core and diffuse halo.\nAt high power, bright, circular, large, diffuse.\nAt high power, bright, circular with large, diffuse, oval halo.\nAt high power, bright, oval nucleus with diffuse, elongated N-S halo.\nAt 64x, bright, roundish in shape, extending NE-SW. Condensed, bright core at 158x.\nAt high power, large, rich, compressed, roundish, bright, resolved to core.\nAt 158x, quite bright, round core with oval, diffuse halo extending NW-SE.\nAt 158x, pretty bright, round, large of fairly even surface brightness.\nBeautiful and brilliant at 158x! The core was quite bright, uniformly circular, and fairly large with an extremely bright nucleus. The large, diffuse halo eased outwards significantly from the brilliant core and was elongated NW \u2013 SE. The round nucleus had sharp, well defined edges which appeared mostly uniform in brightness. There are 2 fairly bright field stars: one to its S and the other to the W.\nVery bright, oval with bright nucleus and diffuse halo at 158x. Elongated E-W.\nVery condensed, small, bright, evenly circular core with few stars resolvable in the halo. The population of stars that were visible in the halo were fairly uniformly spaced and faded evenly as they extended outwards from the core. It looked best at 158x. I noted a very bright outlier star to the S and two very bright field stars located to the E.\nA star is superimposed on the bright, compact core at 158x with direct vision. The diffuse halo was fairly large, extended W-E and becoming brighter as it approached the core and bright nucleus. Averted vision extended the size of the halo a bit. To its E lies an acute triangle of bright stars and to its W is a solitary bright mag 8.5 star.\nIn the same FOV at 64x with direct vision, both galaxies were bright and easy. Each displayed a bright core elongated in a N-S orientation with grainy halos. At 158x, both were in the same FOV and with averted vision, NGC 5194 had a stellar nucleus, bright core and mottled halo. I did not detect the bridge to NGC 5195 which was bright and oval shaped.\nAt 64x, both galaxies filled the FOV forming a beautiful pair with NGC 5195 positioned North of NGC 5194. The core of NGC 5194 was round, pretty large, pretty bright and condensed with a distinctively brighter nucleus. At 158x, the halo had a grainy texture. To its South lay smaller NGC 5195 which appeared circular in shape. It gradually brightened towards the middle, with a small, bright, round core and brighter nucleus.\nAt medium power, bright round core extending NE-SW with mottled halo containing brighter arms. High power resolves some mottling into knots of bright areas.\nAt 158x, this beautiful globular cluster is very bright and large with stars resolved all the way to the core. There were a few prominent chains of stars spiraling out Eastward and there was also a curve of outlier stars to the W. The core had a slight N-S elongation. 190x further resolved the center and 284x drew out even more individual stars at the core. I enjoyed the view best at 158x because it enabled me to view the radiating, curving outlier star chains, as well as, the brilliant individual stars of the nucleus. The outliers were lost at higher magnification although it enabled me to study the core in more detail.\nVery bright and large at 158x with stars resolved all the way to the compact core. Prominent star chains curved eastward and one more to the W. The core had a slight N-S elongation. Outliers lost at higher magnification.\nA small core with elongated halo at 64x became more evident at 158x extending NW-SE with a prominent, bright, stellar nucleus in the core with elongated diffuse halo. A member of the M101 Galaxy group.\nAt 64x, very large, elongated E-W with a small bright nucleus and 2 stars superimposed upon the oval halo. HII regions and spiral structure evident with mottling in the arms. Several small galaxies were visible within an 1\u00ba field and there were more small galaxies in the vicinity than were plotted on my SA2000. 158x revealed more knots and patches of textured brightening: two of the most prominent were located S of the nucleus with a third just N of it. With deeper star charts, this will be a fun area to revisit again.\nBoth at 64x and 158x: small, circular bright core with slightly elongated N-S halo. At 158x, to the N, I noticed a small, stellar galaxy that was not plotted on SA2000. In looking at Starry Night Pro, it was probably NGC 5486. Members of the M101 Galaxy group.\nBright, large, compact, densely populated core. The halo expands considerably outward with the stars fairly uniformly spaced as they radiate out, culminating in curving, spiral chains at 158x.\nThis bright and notably circular globular was small in comparison to M4. It is quite condensed with an almost grainy texture. There is a bright star to the NE. Best at 158x.\nThis beautiful globular cluster is very bright, large, and loosely populated with stars resolved all the way to the core. Spiraling outwards are chains of curving, glittering stars. I preferred the view at 158x.\nLarge, bright, circular, with individual stars easily resolvable at the densely populated core at 64x. Curved chains of stars flowed outwards from the core with averted vision resolving additional stars in the periphery. There were a few prominent chains of stars spiraling eastwards with a curve of outlier stars to the south. 158x drew out even more individual stars at the core. Best at 158x enabling views of the radiating, curving outlier star chains, as well as, the brilliant individual stars of the nucleus. Outliers were lost at higher magnification.\nBright core, easily resolved individual stars. Long, curved chains of stars flowed outwards from the core. Averted vision resolved additional stars towards the periphery.\nAt 64x w/OIII filter the central star appeared a brilliant turquoise blue star. At 284x w/Ultrablock, the star was a brilliant, rich blue shade. Regardless of filter, the star was bathed in nebulosity which extended outwards significantly with averted vision. Annularity was not noted.\nAt 158x, large, cluster with a compact, bright core that appeared densely populated. Its halo is loosely populated and appeared slightly elongated in a N-S position.\nBright, compact, core that appeared densely and evenly populated.\nThis globular cluster was fairly bright and circular with the nucleus a bit brighter than the edges. Granular, fuzzy disk-like appearance; not able to resolve individual stars.\nAt 64x, very bright, large, with stars resolved. Somewhat circular with bright area towards SE region.\nBright, dense, compact core, with elongated halo in a N-S orientation at 158x.\nBright, round, compact core, fuzzy, not resolved at 64x.\nAt 64x, small, somewhat circular with bright core in sparse field. Individual stars not resolvable.\nBright, large, rich, and loose cluster with the butterfly asterism apparent at low power.\nLocated along the western edge of M7, very faint, very small and condensed with averted vision at 64x and 158x in my 10\u2033 dob. Observed in Greg\u2019s 18\u2033 with direct vision, it appears condensed and slightly irregular shaped and with averted vision it was elongated, grainy.\nDetached, bright, condensed, and irregular shaped with stars ranging in brightness.\nAt 64x, loose, bright, roundish, detached cluster.\nAt 64x, bright, small, detached cluster at 64x. Somewhat uniformly distributed.\nBright, large, and irregularly shaped with stars superimposed upon the nebula. A dark lane runs through the cluster in a NW-SW orientation. There is an open cluster, NGC 6530, embedded along its eastern edge.\nSince I was already in Oph, I decided to revisit this PN, and at 64x this bright greenish-blue PN popped out w/Ultrablock in place. There is a bright field star nearby to the SW. While moving the scope, I noticed another bluish-green planetary in the neighborhood; I wonder which one it was? At higher powers it seemed to be slightly elongated in an SE-NW orientation. The halo blinked off with direct vision and with averted vision has an oval, bright, fairly uniform luminous halo. The halo seemed to be nested in a second halo which was grainy textured and becoming diffuse towards the edges.\nAt 64x w/Ultrablock, it appeared a bright, rich, turquoise color with a halo that extends further outwards a bit w/averted vision. The PN appears stellar for the most part at this power with direct vision. At 158x w/OIII, the nebulosity is visible with averted vision as a small greenish-blue halo.\nAt 64x, irregularly shaped with diffuse edges and stars superimposed.\nSparse, irregularly shaped cluster with few stars, and dark regions. Not condensed, not detached from the field.\nAt 64x, Large and bright, shaped like a somewhat rounded letter \u201cZ\u201d. A few stars were superimposed upon the nebula. More definition was discernable with the UltraBlock filter.\nSmall, circular, compact looking, fuzzy disk with a bright core and seated in a field of Milky Way stars.\nAt 64x, round, bright, not resolved, medium compressed.\nAt 64x, loose, bright cluster at 64x with many stars discernable. In a rich field.\nAt 64x, large, round, bright with a chain of stars extending northward.\nDetached, at 64x, irregular, extending N-S with few bright stars.\nAt 64x, detached and delta shaped with dark region. Stars are of a fairly even range in brightness with a bright star near the center.\nThe Ring Nebula (planetary) appeared as a beautiful, annular, nebulous cloud that was slightly elongated E-W. It had well defined, sharp edges but the brightness of the nebulosity of the ring was not uniform. The Ultrablock further resolved the sharpness of the edges of the ring.\nUnevenly bright, annular and slightly elongated E-W with well defined, sharp edges at 64x. Smoky, grayish-white color. Best viewed at 158x with the OIII filter.\nAt 64x w/Ultrablock appeared, brilliant, stellar, and bluish. At 158x w/OIII and averted vision, the nebula appeared disk shaped, becoming diffuse and grayish as it extends outwards; it disappeared with direct vision. There\u2019s a double to the SE.\nI located M56 about midway between Albireo and Sulafat. It was fun to revisit this beautiful star cluster which looked like a fairly uniform, small, fuzzy disk at 64x. Upon closer inspection at 129x, the core was brighter and individual stars were resolvable spiralling outward around the periphery.\nAt 284x w/OIII, appeared stellar and a brilliant, rich, turquoise blue with both direct and averted vision. A double star is located nearby.\nAt 64x w/Ultrablock appeared blue and stellar with direct vision initially. At 284x w/OIII and averted vision, it appeared bluish-green with a wispy hint of oval nebulosity. With direct vision it rounded out and was fairly evenly illuminated and lost its extended definition.\nA small, circular globular with the nucleus brighter than the edges.\nRound, loose, bright, large, resolved. Star chain extends outwards from the northern edge.\nAt 35x w/Ultrablock is small rectangular shaped, expanding a bit with averted vision. At 158x w/OIII there appears to be a star embeded in it with another star adjacent on its NW edge. With direct vision, is of uniform surface brightness but no longer so rectangular in shape and is more irregular shaped at this power.\nThe dark areas I noticed near 6823 turned out to be the dark clouds of this emission nebula. I did not notice the bright areas of the emission nebula.\nBetween Gamma Sagittae and Delta Sagittae. And just like Consolmagno described, it truly did looked like it could be a very loose globular cluster or a very tight open cluster. I noticed irregular groupings of stars without the brilliant central core one tends to see with a globular. Stars were easily resolvable in this cluster. Irregular shape.\nCompressed, faint with bright round, core, stars unresolved.\nAt low power with direct vision it appeared small, bright, and stellar with a rich blue color at both 35x and 64x with the Ultrablock in place. At 158x and 190x with/OIII and direct vision, a grayish-blue disk is visible surrounding the brighter central star component. W/averted vision and filtered, it looks very bright and slightly oval shaped with well defined edges of fairly consistent surface brightness. I\u2019m undecided whether I was seeing the central star or a small knot located at the center of the nebula that had a very high surface brightness\u2026to be revisited again when the moon is not interfering.\nAt 35x, I noted a cross-shaped asterism formed by several bright stars. The cross was enveloped in a clustering of many fainter stars that surrounded it.\nAt high power, bright, large, compact cluster with denser, bright core. Stars unresolved.\nAt 64x, few stars forming a V-shape/triangle.\nAt 64x the nebulae where elongated, wispy, strands much larger than my 1 degree FOV and easily visible with the UltraBlock filter in place as a delicate, lacey network of gray, ghostly filaments. Other than grayish-white, additional color was not apparent.\nLarge, beautiful, bright, deep blue color with direct vision at 158 w/OIII. Appears rectangular and elongated in an E-W orientation. There are three stars lined up with the planetary it in a winding pattern, 1 on one side and 2 on the other.\nAppeared blue at 284x w/OIII with direct vision and bluish-gray at 158x w/OIII. Ghostly, glowing, spherical object with 2 stars located to the E.\nAt 64x, this dense globular was bright at the core and had a faint halo with few individual stars resolvable.\nAt 64x, small, bright, compact cluster with dense core. Stars resolved to core.\nLarge with few bright stars and little compression; irregularly shaped. Not well detached, no concentration of stars.\nCompressed, bright and large with small core towards NE. There are 2 star chains extending northward.\nScores of stars in a rich star field. There were several bright stars: one had a soft yellow tone stood out from the others.\nAt 64x, very large, rich, dense cluster of stars. Fairly even surface brightness.\nAt 64x, bluish nebulosity was apparent around the stars which became more apparent at 129x and then at 284x.\n64x revealed a wide pair of bright white stars of equal magnitude. There is a bright field star to the SW."

Far better than some expert claiming this or that ammo should do a particular job as opposed to what it will do.\nOne important bit is shot choice. Only shoot at birds you can kill.\nThe one thing I take exception to is the killing ability of No. 2 steel. Although penetration tests say it's finished at 41 yards, being hit with something that large in diameter has a certain way of adding additional killing power. Well past 41 yards.... in my field experience.\nThanks for the detailed report. I tried some of it in 12 gauge #5 and 6 this year. It's a good option for my fixed choke sxs when I'm hunting a refuge that requires non-tox. Unfortunately all I was able to test it on was quail. Not exactly hard to kill. It was late in the season and the roosters were extremely wary.\nWhile it's half the price of hevi-shot, I still hope the price comes down as it becomes more available. I was only able to find it at Cabelas.\norhunter wrote: Thanks. I like these personal experience field tests. Far better than some expert claiming this or that ammo should do a particular job as opposed to what it will do.\nI used to roll my own steel loads around '02-'04, and I toyed with the fast stuff... reloading upwards of 1700fps #3s (until Kent started making a decent load off the shelf).\nThough I could never get them to pattern consistently or very well for that matter, I had two memorable shots with them.\nOne was a woodduck that my dog bumped off of a beaver pond, and I pass shot as it came down the creek.\nImmediately after I folded it, it hit a tree and dropped straight down. I paced it at 45yds, GPS said 40yds... it had 6 pellet holes, 3 in and 3 exiting (i.e. all pass thrus).\nPass thrus at 40 yards! And, moreover the duck was pole-axed dead on contact.\nPenetration tests are OK, but insitu tests are the reality. KE = 1/2 mv\u00b2 Velocity kills!!!!\nSo, anecdotally I agree with orhunter.\nI used the Kent Bismuth loads in my 16 gauge for hunting sharptails where non toxic shot was required. I didn't kill a lot of birds with them, but I saw no difference between the bismuth and lead with the birds that I did shoot.\nstubblejumper wrote: I used the Kent Bismuth loads in my 16 gauge for hunting sharptails where non toxic shot was required. I didn't kill a lot of birds with them, but I saw no difference between the bismuth and lead with the birds that I did shoot.\nThanks stubblejumper. Bismuth is pretty good.\nFor those who may be interested, here's a quick overview of some common non-toxic alternatives to steel shot.\nBismuth was the only alternative to steel shot during the early years of the non-toxic shot era. It's not as dense as lead, but it's enough better than steel that waterfowlers took notice of it's knock down advantage over steel when it first came out. The knock on it at the time was the cost. It's now cheaper than most of the other non-steel options. It's also a lot softer than steel so (as you noted) it can be used in older guns. Currently about $1.60 per shell in 12 ga 2 3/4 MSRP in boxes of 10.\nKent makes a product called Tungsten Matrix that's about the same density as lead, and is soft enough to be used in older guns. It's virtually identical to lead in performance. Pure tungsten is quite a bit denser than lead, and too pricey to make shot out of it alone. They blend the tungsten with (believe it or not) plastic to get the hardness down to something that can be shot in older shotguns. This yields shot that is similar in hardness and density to lead. Currently about $3.80 per shell in 12 ga 2 3/4 MSRP in boxes of 10.\nHevi-Shot is a blend of tungsten, nickel, and iron. It's about 5.5% heavier than lead. In my experience, standard Hevi-Shot hits harder than anything I've used and patterns well in all the guns I've shot it through. Regular Hevi-Shot is too hard to be used in older guns. But they've more recently come out with a Hevi-Shot Classic Doubles line of shells that is more like Tungsten Matrix and is targeted at guns with softer steel barrels. Currently about $4.20 per shell for 12 ga 2 3/4 MSRP in boxes of 10 for standard Hevi-Shot waterfowl loads. Currently about $3.80 per shell for 12 ga 2 3/4 MSRP in boxes of 10 for Classic Doubles.\nThe Hevi-Shot folks also have a line of shells called Hevi-Metal that is a mix of standard steel pellets and tungsten+nickel+iron Hevi-Shot pellets (roughly 50/50 of each by weight). The advertised advantage of these shells is that the Hevi-Shot pellets are two sizes smaller than the steel pellets, which allows for matching of velocity between the two pellet types and also gives quite a bit more pellets per shell than standard steel. It can be considered a compromise to get some Hevi-Shot performance at a greatly reduced price. I have used these with good results on big Canada geese. There is no doubt in my mind that they hit harder than regular steel, but they're not as good as full Hevi-Shot or Tungsten Matrix. Currently about $1.04 per shell for 12 ga 3\" MSRP in boxes of 25.\nWe have one sharptail hunt that takes place on a military base where non tox shot is required, or I would not bother with it, but I would rather shoot bismuth through my SxS shotguns than steel. That being said, we only fire a few shots each during that hunt, so a box lasts years.\nI've been using only Bismuth for pheasant hunting the last 3 years. I started with Rio and switched to Kent when it became available. I was using 3\" shells with #5 shot out of an improved cylinder choke. I know that's a heavy load, and they do hit a bit too hard over a pointer unless I give them a second or two to fly, but I use it due to only hunting pressured public land and often with a flushing dog in the mix. I see no difference between these shells and Prairie Storm that I used to use. They are a little bit more expensive but I continue to use them so I don't have to switch from lead to non-tox when going onto federal land and I just feel better not spreading lead everywhere.\nMy wife wanted to join me duck hunting one day this year, which meant she was carrying my 28 gauge, which meant I bought a box of the Kent Bismuth.\nI told her, wait til they seem to stop moving in the air over the decoys.\nShe got two Blue Bills that hit the water dead.\nI used the 20 gauge Kent Bismuth on sharptails Saturday, with great results. Shots in the 30-40 yard range, and birds fell dead.\nLimited out on ducks during the opener thanks to Kent Bismuth. Mallards, Canvasback, Widgeons, Gadwalls and Teal all crumpled. Even bagged a Giant Canada!"

                            "text": "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. - Stacy Lewis waited an entire day to hit her first shot at the U.S. Women's Open. It didn't take nearly as long for her to find the top of the leaderboard.\nSeeking her second major championship of the season, Lewis made four birdies over the last nine holes of the first round Friday to take a one-shot lead into lunch.\nLess than an hour later, she was back on the course for the second round - a 36-hole day on tap, as the players try to make up ground after being rained out Thursday.\nThe delays will turn the U.S. Open into a bigger endurance contest than it already is. But for starters, Lewis was in good form.\n\"It's in the back of your mind when you're walking up those hills at the end,\" Lewis said of the long day of golf. \"But everybody's got to do it, so you've just got to go out and do it, too.\"\nTrailing Lewis by a shot were and Ryann O'Toole and newly turned pro Lizette Salas, who also had afternoon tee times.\n\"It's kind of nerve wracking, but it comes with the territory,\" said Salas, a four-time All-American from Southern California.\nAlso in the three-way tie for second was amateur Amy Anderson, who came to the Broadmoor early Friday to finish her first round, but won't start her second until Saturday morning, at the earliest.\n\"It's exciting; hasn't sunk in,\" said Anderson, a second-team All-American at North Dakota State. \"To me, it's felt like another tournament, just on the tour.\"\nAll the tour's best are here, though Lewis, who won the Kraft Nabisco earlier this year, came in overshadowed - like everybody else - by Yani Tseng. Tseng is seeking to complete the career Grand Slam and is only two weeks removed from a 10-stroke victory at the LPGA Championship.\nShe went wire-to-wire in that one, but won't repeat that at the 7,000-yard Broadmoor. She struggled keeping it straight - hitting only eight of 14 fairways - and finished the first round at 2-over 73.\n\"I kind of got used to the golf course,\" Tseng said. \"And then, I just kind of have to go back in the afternoon.\"\nTseng was one shot behind defending champion Paula Creamer, who hit 14 greens in regulation but was often hitting her first putts from 20, 30 feet away.\n\"You can definitely shoot a good score,\" Creamer said after her 72. \"Maybe one green I missed all day, but I just had some three-putts.\"\nKarrie Webb was in a six-way tie for fifth at 1-under 70. Webb was among those who came to the course early to finish her round. She played three holes, made a birdie on the last one, then went home to sit through a long wait.\nCristie Kerr also had a quick day. Kerr shared the lead with Anderson overnight and faced a long bunker shot in front of the seventh green when she returned early Friday. She couldn't save par there and also bogeyed No. 8. She finished her round at even-par 71, but walked off the course with a good outlook.\n\"I'm not going to stress over it,\" she said. \"I'm pleased I have a lot of time to work on my game with my coach. I'm going to get rested up, because it's going to be a long weekend.\""

                            "text": "On offense, every possession must be valued. The goal of every possession is to get at least one good shot (and maybe more if we attack the offensive boards)... but at least one good shot (or two free-throws) each trip up the court. Notice that I did not say that we will score each time, because that is unrealistic. But we must value each possession, protect the ball, and get a good shot... each trip. Various violations (traveling, 3-seconds, illegal screen, etc.) and bad passing get in the way of achieving our goal of getting a good shot. Making bad decisions with the ball leads to turnovers and bad passes... e.g. dribble-penetration into two or three defenders, forcing a bad pass into the defense, etc. Have you ever watched an NBA or college game where a team fails to score for a long time? Usually it's not because of just poor shooting... it's turnovers, poor offensive execution, and poor shot selection. So... get a good shot each possession!\nThe 3-point shot is an important part of the game. But shooting a 3 every trip is not high percentage basketball. A 3-point shot taken with a defender flying out at the shooter is not a good shot (a shot fake and drive would be better here). So when is a 3-point shot a good shot? It's a good shot when your best shooter gets a wide-open look... or when a guard dribble-drives and then kicks the ball outside for a wide-open shot... or on a skip-pass where the shooter is wide-open. A 3-point shot in transition can be a good shot as well, unless we have a slim lead late in the game (as discussed above).\nForced shots inside are not good shots either. How often I see younger post players get an offensive rebound, only to throw it back up, contested, or off-balance and not squared up to the hoop... it's like the player thinks, \"I got the rebound so I get to shoot it again.\" A much better play would be, if the put-back shot is not open, kick it outside to a perimeter player, who may be wide-open for a 3-point shot, or at least re-start the offense and, if you are leading, run some more time off the clock.\nDribble-drive and dish or kick-out is great offense and difficult to defend. But dribble-driving into a crowd and forcing up a bad shot is bad basketball.\nPassing up a good, open shot is not desirable either, unless you are trying to run time off the clock. Sometimes a player will pass up a good shot, and then a bad pass or turnover occurs, and we get no shot at all.\nCan little guys out-rebound a bigger team? It's hard, but if everyone is aggressive in boxing-out their man away from the hoop, it can frustrate the opponent, and instead of working to get around your box-out, they may start pushing in the back or going over the top... which may get their \"bigs\" in foul trouble. Boxing-out is a foot war... quickness counts.\nWe have a rule on sprinting back... whenever the ball is even or ahead of you going up the floor, you had better be in an all-out sprint to catch up, or we'll assume that you are tired and need a rest on the bench! But what if my best player is not getting back? Well, he may not really be your best player, or he's tired and needs a rest. Great players want to win and compete on both ends of the court."

Meanwhile, Jim Furyk and Lee Westwood have just teed off in the foursomes. Of course, it is now alternate shots rather than everybody having their own ball.\nMcllroy and Garcia have had a poor morning. Not looking good for the foursomes.\nInteresting thoughts, Al. They haven't been at their brilliant best and it's been a scrappy game but they could still seal a point against a very strong pairing. Still with their best to come, I would fancy them this afternoon.\nNot a bad first ever Ryder Cup shot for Jamie Donaldson, setting Westwood up nicely with a good approach shot. Meanwhile in the fourballs, Garcia just misses a chip in and it's all square heading into the 18th.\nnow is Mcllroy's chance to show his class.\nFoursomes pairing number two about to get underway. In-form Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson take on Hunter Mahan and Zach Johnson. Who's your money on?\nRose and Stenson are both playing well and will be too strong.\nWestwood can't follow up on Donaldson's fine approach, his birdie attempt just short.\nShocking opener at the 18th from Bradley, sails well left leaving Mickelson to probably seal the deal. He finds the fairway. In response McIlroy also goes well out to the left while Garcia lands right next to Mickelson.\nDonaldson/Westwood v Furyk/Kuchar - Shared first hole in the foursomes.\nI thought Justin Rose might be a key player for Europe this year and he's certainly suggested that so far. Follows up his fine form this morning with a brilliant tee shot in the foursomes.\nI'm not convinced about pairing Garcia and Mcllroy. They are not feeding off each other.\nHow big could that be? Mickelson falls just short and lands in the bunker by the green on the 18th.\nMcIlroy and Garcia are set to tee off again in the foursomes in five minutes. Safe to say that will not be happening. Their afternoon match will be a bit delayed as they need at least half an hour in the team room.\nBradley back in business after that poor first shot and he chips nicely onto the green. All three other men are in the bunker.\nA couple of good shots out the bunker from the European boys but it's advantage USA now.\nRory misses his chance and it's down to Bradley now to win it.\nRory has played like a muppett.\nCan you believe it!? Bradley's mixed hole ends in disappointment and it's in the balance once again.\nGarcia makes par, but it's Mickelson's three foot putt for the win.\nHow many birdies to Garcia and Mcllroy make? Very ordinary.\nA morning of two halves for Europe I'd say. Looked great through the first nine but they trail by a point at the end of that session.\nShame, was hoping McIlroy & Garcia would at least half it, lets see what this afternoon brings.\nJay hardly No1 and No3 in the world form though.\nAny idea who these guys are supporting...?\nRose & Stenson v Mahan & Johnson. The European pair continuing their form as Rose lands a long one to take the lead.\nDonaldson & McDowell v Furyk & Kuchar. Jamie Donaldson misses his five foot putt and USA take the lead in match one.\nDonaldson so close to putting Europe 2 up but the ball won't drop. After a shaky start, the Welshman is looking good.\nZach Johnson holes the putt, after an interesting system of Mahan straddling the ball first, to reduce the lead to one.\nMcDowell & Dubuisson v Bradley & Mickelson - Bradley misses allowing Dubuisson and McDowell to move 1 up. They lead in every match.\nMcIlroy & Garcia got this one on thought, both held out Fowler in this years open they have the beating of him and Walker, Walker's game nowhere near the europeans either.\nNope Walker only made one putt this morning, although that was to seal half a point on the 18th.\nCan't ask for much more than that from your partner! A superb approach shot from rookie Dubuisson sets Westwood up beautifully.\nDifferent scenario i know, however when its head to head mentally we europeans have the edge."

                            "text": "Tom Lehman called the 18th hole at Harding Park \"goofy,\" which is apropos, because if Goofy was a pro golfer, he'd eat this hole up.\nGoofy, being long and lanky, and no wimp, would take the most courageous approach to the hole, which is to unsheathe the driver with a flourish and slam the tee shot over the chunk of lake and toward the distant treetops, then give the old Goofy yodel as the ball ricochets among the Cypress trees.\nHarding's 18th is the perfect finishing hole for San Francisco's darling, re-made course.\nSan Francisco has a goofy street (Lombard), a goofy prison (Alcatraz) and a goofy mode of transit (cable car), so it's fitting that the city's hip sports venue has a goofy finishing hole.\nThursday, No. 18 was the toughest hole. Only three of the 71 players birdied it, including first-round leader Colin Montgomerie.\nAnd that was on an easy day. As Montgomerie said, \"We were lucky today, it was sort of downwind off the tee shot, but if it's the other way around, it can be very, very difficult.\"\nSo if the wind comes up today, we could see some genuine anguish and floundering on 18.\nThe goofy 18 is a 468-yard par-4, dogleg left, a test of nerve and judgment. The big boys drive straight, either straight over the first tree in a line of 10 trees, or just to the right of that big tree.\nThe more conservative, and the shorter hitters, hit 3-wood to the right of the mean tree. But if the wind is at the player's back, as it was a bit in the afternoon, the 3-woods tend to carry into one of two bunkers.\n\"If your chili is running hot, you go with the driver,\" is the way one golf insider put it.\nThe second shot -- wedge for the big boys, 5- to 7-iron for the others -- is uphill to a narrow, multi-level, multi-break, multi-heartbreak green.\nAdding to the difficulty of the second shot is the looming row of corporate luxury boxes, where it's always happy hour. The gay chatter, laughter and tinkling of ice can distract the sensitive golfer. More than one competitor Thursday shouted a plea for quiet from the swells.\nSix players inducted themselves into the 18th hole 300-Yard Drive Club on Thursday -- Fred Couples (344), Stuart Appleby (331), John Daly (325), Niclas Fasth (312), Nick Dougherty (307) and K.J. Choi (307). The golfers say the 18th favors the long hitters, but none of the 300-yard belters birdied the hole.\nIn Harding Park's extreme makeover, the 18th green was moved back, adding to the temptation to cut the corner with a driver and make the approach shot less daunting. The makeover architect, Chris Gray, admitted earlier this week, \"I think 18's a little bit of an awkward hole. It has the potential for controversy.\"\nThe pros have been lavish in their praise of the new Harding, but the 71-man jury is still out on No. 18, a hole that is kind of out-of-character with the rest of the course.\n\"It's the only hole that's kind of goofy,\" Lehman said. \"The tee shot is a little awkward. The hole forces you to hit a good driver, and a good iron. So at the end of the day, it is a good finishing hole.\"\nNone of the golfers fell in love with picturesque No. 18, which makes it all the more lovable to the spectator, assuming the spectator enjoys a hole that takes the world's best golfers out of their comfort zone.\nBilly Mayfair calls 18 \"Really severe.\"\n\"It's not my favorite hole,\" Jim Furyk said.\nIan Poulter said, \"It's a tricky hole. You have to think about it, you have so many different options.\"\n\"It's the only quirky hole on the golf course,\" Luke Donald said. \"I think they might reconsider it. If you take out the corner tree, I think it would be fine.\"\nBetter yet, let's give the 18th even more personality by giving a name to the big cypress that knocks down or deflects so many hearts. How about calling it Nate Thurmond?\nIf you come to the 18th on Sunday one shot off the lead, you're most likely going to have to put away your dinky 3-wood, pull out the driver and challenge Big Nate.\n\"It's certainly different,\" Tiger Woods said of 18. \"You know, it's one of those holes if the tee was more to the right, I think it would be just a great hole. But because you've got to carry so much in the air, I don't see it being a great hole.\""

This latest fund-raiser brings the total to nearly \u00a345k raised for the two charities by Tramlines and Sarah\u2019s friends and family.\nOn Sunday 14th April, Sheffield hosted the annual Half Marathon. Amongst the thousands of runners taking part were, \u2018The most unlikely marathon team ever\u2019 (a collection of mostly non-runners from Sheffield\u2019s music industry) and members of Sarah Nulty\u2019s family who were raising money for Weston Park Cancer Charity andCavendish Cancer Care. The runners far surpassed their goal of \u00a310k and including gift aid donations, they have raised over a staggering \u00a315k. The fund raising has not stopped, donations can still be made via the My Donate page.\nSarah Nulty was director at Tramlines Festival from 2013 \u2013 2018, and sadly passed away at the age of 36 just weeks before she saw her hard work become a reality in the festival\u2019s 10th anniversary event. Sarah was instrumental in the launch of Tramlines in 2009, coordinating venues and handling bookings and later working in the commercial department. Tenacious, innovative and thoroughly unbreakable, Sarah led Tramlines through its toughest and most pivotal times.\nSarah\u2019s family and friends felt moved to raise money for these two charities in recognition of the work they did for Sarah and in the hope that they may provide for cancer sufferers in the future. Donations were also generated for Weston Park Cancer Charity and Cavendish Cancer Care during the festival last year. The combined total raised is now nearly \u00a345k.\n\u2018We made it and everyone should feel so proud of this achievement. This run was about bringing people together. It\u2019s testimony to lasting positive effect that Sarah had on the people who she was connected to. We hope we can continue to be inspired by Sarah in the future and continue to do good work in her name.\nSince Sarah Nulty\u2019s passing last year, she has been bestowed with many posthumous awards and memorials. This includes an \u2018Outstanding Contribution Award\u2019 from both AIF (Association of Independent Festivals) and the UK Festival Awards, who also created the \u2018Sarah Nulty Women in Festivals Award\u2019. Sheffield City Councilpaid homage with a memorial plaque at Devonshire Green in Sheffield City Centre, and a Civic Award from the Lord Mayor of Sheffield, Magid Magid.\nOn 7th March 2019, The Star (Sheffield based publication) launched their \u2018Women of Sheffield\u2019 awards. They created the \u2018Sarah Nulty award for Creativity\u2019 in respect to her dedication to the music industry of Sheffield. The first winner of this award was Vicky Morris who was presented the award by Sarah\u2019s mum, Julie Voisey.\nTramlines Festival will continue its commitment to supporting local charities and causes during the 2019 event.\nThis years Tramlines Festival will take place in Hillsbrough Park on 19-21st July 2019 with the likes of The Manic Street Preachers, Two Door Cinema Club and Rag and Bone man to name a few."

She is an international commentator on Muslim lifestyle and British Muslims in particular, having spent the last decade as a writer and broadcaster on Islamic issues. Raised as a Catholic, Sarah converted to Islam at 16 and married Mahmud al-Rashid in '92. She now resides in London with both husband and three children (whom I have met and adore).\nThe acclaimed Emel.com is a must have for every literate person.\nFor further insight into her background just Google 'Sarah Joseph' and check out CNN coverage, interviews, her speeches and responses to current affairs.\nI have met Sarah too and was blessed to talk to her about several ideas and issues. She listened, paid full attention, held her smile and spoke with eloquence and enthusiasm as though that was the last moment. Masha'Allah, may every mother, wife and sister be a Sarah Joseph, an Iconic Muslim.\nResearch on Sarah's lifestyle and gardening too, it's very amusing.\nSarah is indeed a brilliant human being, a well versed diplomat on matters of an Islamic nature and true to her beliefs. I had the wonderful pleasure of being Chief Operating Officer for emel for what turned out sadly to be a very short period of time.\nIn that time I got to know Sarah pretty well, and like all of us the perceived confidence that is seen and exhausted through communicating with many many different groups also hides a distinct lack of confidence.\nSarah truly does believe in everything she stands for and believes in, however this also shows itself in sometimes an unbending way, not a holistically helpful way.\nThe fact that every time you read about Sarah you will also preface with 'raised a catholic' is, in my view, a way of trying to be more accepting of the Islamic way of life than someone who was already raised this way, a need for over acceptance, which is not always a healthy way to announce yourself.\nHowever, the work that has been done has truly helped create a much needed bridge between Muslims and Non Muslims but in reality this needs to be achieved at a local everyday level and I thank Sarah for at least starting the process that this could actually happen."

I stood there with both hands around my cappuccino and with my eyes fixed on his.\n\u201cCan I sit?\u201d He said looking away.\n\u201cSure.\u201d I said after a sip, it was not me he had to ask permission.\nIf you don\u2019t know anything about me, it\u2019s because you cut all possible relationship without giving any further explanation, I thought.\n\u201cI am doing great\u201d Another smile and another sip of coffee.\n\u201cMemories\u201d He said after a long sigh.\n\u201cMm\u201d Another sip of coffee with the lost glance in the outside.\nAt last silence again. The murmur of the bar filled my ears making me feel as if I was alone again, but it didn\u2019t last long.\n\u201cThank you!\u201d Another smile while I fixed my hair, I wasn\u2019t expecting that.\nI made a little time stirring the coffee, weighing whether I wanted to lead the conversation that way or not. What the hell! It was him who started this uncomfortable conversation.\n\u201cEvery day, we were so alike \u2026\u201d He said after a sigh.\nHe turned his eyes away and silence reigned in the conversation once more. My coffee was over.\nI got up from the table and put on my jacket. Without coffee there was nothing to hold me there with him.\nI did not wait for his answer nor shake his hand as a farewell. I just smiled at him one last time and turned around to leave. I left the cafe without looking back even once, feeling his gaze on my back.\nMeetings in a cafe are a series of short tales that talk about imaginary conversations that could have any person in any cafe of any city.\nIs there something personal in them? Well of course, there\u2019s something personal in everting a writer writes. However, it might not be as obvious as it seems to be beforehand.\nAre them conversations I\u2019d like to have? It depends. Some of the are, some other I\u2019d rather die.\nAre they real or just fiction Some of them come from my imagination, but some other came to me while driving tea elsewhere by listening to other\u2019s conversations (don\u2019t judge me too hard for eavesdropping).\nHow many will I write? Who knows! Maybe thousands, maybe just a couple of them, however, my idea is to write one of them per month.\nAnyway, I hope you like them. I\u2019d like to know whether you\u2019ve felt identified in some of them or if there is someone with who you\u2019d want to have a similar conversation.\nI was expecting this one for almost a week!

There was the sharp, brief and muted clink of full pint glasses, heard at the bar during Happy Hour as the construction workers from the nearby site congratulated each other on a job well done.

Sometimes it can become a distraction as people start to click their glasses every 10 minutes. So what do you do to prevent this headache from happening at your wedding reception? Well your in luck, because we have great ideas on how to keep people occupied with other activities. Most importantly you are kissing without the annoying noise.\nHow did the whole tradition of clinking start anyways? People way back in medieval times would clink drinks because of poisoned wine. If a host wanted to demonstrate to others that the beverage wasn\u2019t tampered with, they would pour some of the guests drink into theirs and drink it. If the guests had faith in their host\u2019s intentions they would tap their glasses once the host offered his cup for a sample. Hence the tapping of cups has become a symbol of trust, integrity, and toast to well being.\nAnother interesting way to get you kissing is to have people tell a person story about you during the meal over the mic. The format of the speeches can be as informal as you like. Mostly, it will be up to the person telling the story to determine what will be said\u2026 and how it will be said. This is one of the reasons you might want to avoid this method, you have less control over what happens. However, those candid moments can lead to some of the best parts of the reception. Just imagine the stories that will be told, it will really give guests more information on your background, how you met, and your quirky little moments. The main reasons this usually happens during dinner is because that is usually the down point of the reception. You can speed things up and keep them more lively by incorporating speeches for kissing.\nForget the glasses, you might want to uses wedding bells on your wedding day. It has a better sound to some couples. These are done at a handful of reception. You can purchase the bells online from a variety of retailers. You can have little notes attached to the bell or match it with your wedding colors. Keep this in mind when you decide on how to avoid the clinking of the glasses.\nAlmost everyone will bring a date to your wedding reception. The best way to get them involved is by having them kiss too! The trick is that once they do a kiss, the guests of honor have to imitate the kiss the same way. Couples will go by the dance floor and initiate the kiss, it will get tons of laughs! One of the best examples I have seen is people running to eachother in slow motion like they do in movies. Now if that won\u2019t get laughs, I don\u2019t know what will. Majority of people attending a reception will bring a date. So why not have the guests kiss, and have the guests of honor recreate the kiss.\nThese are four examples on ways you can make your wedding standout. If you are looking for something different that will keep your guests involved you might want to try one of the above recommendations. If you have more ideas on ways to prevent guests from clinking their glasses, feel free to share it below in the comments section.\nThank you for the information. The online world is so full of garbage it\u2019s difficult to find what you\u2019re looking for these days."

In 1920, this Montana newswriter, who wrote for the Anaconda Standard with the pen name Betty Butte, performed risky aerial stunts and knocked the socks off the crowds at the State Fairgrounds. They\u2019d never seen a woman flying an airplane like that before. Most of them had probably never heard of a female pilot before either. But Georgia, being quite the daredevil, proved that they could.\nBefore her famous flight, Georgia was fascinated with flying and enjoyed watching airplanes take off. It was love at first sight, so to say. But Georgia soon had enough of just watching the planes from a distance. She was ready to take to the air. In black and white photographs she grins, looking very much like the Red Baron in her leather cap, goggles, and the rest of her flying gear\u2014well, except for the curls escaping from her cap and the dark lipstick she was wearing.\nIt was the winter of 1917 when Georgia went on her first airplane trip in Venice, California, making her maiden voyage in a passenger plane belonging to the Crawford Airplane Company. She was hooked ever since. Like Georgia, her husband was also an aviator and flying enthusiast. Georgia even took her daughter up to 2,500 feet when Jimmie was just four months old and claimed that the infant seemed to love ever minute of being airborne."

We\u2019re introduced to a bunch of mothers \u2013 there\u2019s Rachel, the nice, normal, if slightly scatty one who is just recovering from her husband doing a runner; Bea, the Queen Bee who everyone wants to hang out with; Heather who tries too hard; Jo, the permanently downtrodden stressball; Georgie, ascerbic and refusing to get involved. The beginning of the book sees this long standing group expanded by the arrival of Bubba, best described as nice but dim, Melissa, a boringly perfect Fairy Godmother type and \u2013 of course \u2013 Tom Orchard, handsome new headmaster.\nMost of the action takes place at drop off or pickup time, or at PTA related activities like the fundraising committee meeting, the Lunch Ladder or the Lakeside Ball. This leads to something of a whirlwind narrative; conversations are left unfinished, misunderstandings have room to flourish, we never find out quite what\u2019s going on behind the facade. This is of course an accurate reflection of life at the school gates \u2013 half formed friendships that never have a chance to blossom, snatched snippets of conversation, wondering if that person is really in a hurry or if you (or your kids) have done something randomly wrong. However, the very accuracy of the device leads to the book\u2019s biggest downfall \u2013 I did not get to know any of the characters enough to really care what happened in their lives. I mean I know I was supposed to be looking forward to Rachel and Tom getting together, and I know I was supposed to be glad that the new Queen Bee of the playground seemed to be a force for good rather than the shallow and heartless Bea, but really? I just wasn\u2019t that bothered.\nI would have liked to know more about the children too \u2013 perhaps this is the mother in me speaking but for a novel based at the school gates, they seemed conspicuous by their absence \u2013 even in the life of Rachel, the main protagonist. Right now I can\u2019t actually remember the name of a single one of the kids belonging to this gaggle of mothers and while I get that the novel is about female friendship rather than motherhood, perhaps some more about the children and their interactions would have provided a bit more depth to the mothers themselves.\nThere were some potentially serious themes in the book \u2013 a parent\u2019s suicide; classroom bullying (pretty much unnoticed by the mothers); Heather\u2019s growth in confidence being accompanied by a growth in meanness; but these were treated to much the same haphazard narrative as the more lighthearted events that make up the bulk of the book, and as such, did not add anything at all. I also personally found the final flourish of Bea\u2019s downfall somewhat unnecessary. I\u2019m all for comeuppance where it\u2019s needed but the flippant references to Zimmer frames and the need for a carer \u2013 along with the complete lack of interest from the supposedly good hearted main characters \u2013 left a sour taste in my mouth.\nI approached The Hive in the way that I\u2019d approach a Catherine Alliott or an Adele Parks. Not the kind of reading matter I\u2019d bring up in a job interview, sure, but usually enjoyable, amusing, and perfect holiday reading. I\u2019m sorry to say that despite being generally well reviewed, I really was not that fussed on it at all. However \u2013 in the balance of fairness, you might like to read these other, far more positive reviews before making up your mind!"

That is quite different to the kind of belonging that you opt in to. The kind where you have sought it out and chosen to opt in.\nThis week I have been going over my Facebook groups and determining which ones of them I truly feel as though I belong in. I have opted out of many based on this criterion. If it is a group that I feel I can post pretty much what I am thinking about a topic on any day and it will get interaction, then they make the cut.\nIf it is one where I either must edit what I want to write extensively or only jump into it every so often to see what is happening, then that tells me it is not for me. I am hoping that people can apply this to our Being More Human Circle Facebook group.\nPlease ask to join, if and only if you are after a feeling of belonging. I think that we do that well in this group, it is a little bit of social media real estate that has true soul!! If you love it, please feel free to share it. If not, you are free to jump out!

                            "text": "Despite David Malouf's An Imaginary Life not being set in Australia, or having Australian characters, it should be considered as a great Australian novel, writes Dallas J Baker.\n\u2026 further from the far, safe place where I began, the green lands of my father\u2019s farm, further from the last inhabited outpost of the known world, further from speech even, into the sighing grasslands that are silence \u2026 (David Malouf, An Imaginary Life).\nDavid Malouf\u2019s An Imaginary Life is not set in Australia and has no Australian characters. It is set at the edge of the Roman Empire, in the first century AD. Australia as \u201cAustralia\u201d would not exist for almost 2,000 years. This lack of identifiably Australian components is probably why An Imaginary Life is rarely mentioned as a great Australian book that deserves more attention.\nAn Imaginary Life is exceptionally well written, rich in poetry and evocative detail. It is a work reminiscent of the writings of a mountain hermit or nature mystic \u2013 but that\u2019s not why I selected it as the one Australian book that deserves more attention. I selected it because its central themes resonate with ongoing debates about what it means to be Australian.\nWhat kind of Australian literature is this?\nAt first glance, Malouf\u2019s second novel does not look like an Australian story at all.\nIt doesn\u2019t strongly feature the Australian landscape or sense of place, nor does it offer us characters of the type we have come to expect of typically Australian writing. There are no larrikins, no diggers, no Aussie battlers, and no tough yet world-wise women with hearts of gold.\nTo me, though, it reflects a significant aspect of the Australian story \u2013 a sense of exile.\nAn Imaginary Life tells the story of Ovid, the most famous and most irreverent poet of imperial Rome. Ovid\u2019s irreverence leads to his banishment to an isolated village on the shores of the Black Sea in current day Romania, a place occupying the literal edge of the Roman Empire.\nExiled to the limit of the known world, Ovid is cut off from his own culture, even from his language. Slowly, the poet learns to depend on and respect those around him, those he once saw as unsophisticated barbarians because of their inability to speak Latin, their poverty, and their closeness to nature. Ovid sees nature as something somehow frightening, wild, unless it is cultivated, transformed and made productive by human hands.\nHis worldview is challenged when he encounters an untamed boy who has lived out in the wilderness with wild creatures. Ovid captures and tries to \u201ccivilise\u201d the boy \u2013 but this backfires on the poet in unexpected ways. By observing the wild boy, and then following him into the wilderness, Ovid realises Rome is not the whole world, and not even the centre of it.\nOvid\u2019s predicament should be familiar to many Australians. Like the poet, many of us are acquainted with the feeling of being at the edge of things, on the wild borders of regions and empires to which we do not quite belong, or do not belong any more.\nFor the first century or so after colonisation, Australia was on the periphery of the British Empire. Then, from the second world war to the 1990s, we understood ourselves to be on the outer limits of the USA\u2019s sphere of influence. Now we see ourselves as on the edge of the Asian region, but not really part of it. We seem to always be a part of something and yet apart from it.\nWhen non-Indigenous Australians think about the history of their belonging to this place, they inevitably come to a moment of arrival; either recent or generations back, either as free migrants, refugees or exiled convicts. They also come to a moment of departure from somewhere else, the places where their ancestors, or they themselves, once belonged.\nIndigenous Australians also know exile. European colonisation dispossessed them of their country. Over the decades that followed, many of them were forcibly moved to missions in places as foreign to them as the Old World. There is in Indigenous communities a deep yearning and mourning for lost places; places locked behind gates and fences, places buried beneath cities and suburbs, roads and farms.\nThe somewhere else in our personal histories \u2013 those places we lost or left \u2013 plays a big part in how we think about ourselves. It produces a sense of national belonging that is never quite secure.\nA common response to that insecurity is a kind of aloofness, a standing apart from the rest of the world. We like to single ourselves out, to brandish our physical and cultural distance from other places, our un-belonging as it were, as a mark of uniqueness, and of national identity that distinguishes us from others.\nThis is also Ovid\u2019s initial response to his exile, to cling firmly to that which makes him different, to refuse to truly belong either to his community of exile or to Rome, which has cast him out.\nAnother common response to this insecurity, that sense of un-belonging, is to turn to nature, to the environment.\nThat may be why so much Australian writing has a strong sense of place, and why when we think of important Australian novels they are often ones that feature landscape as a character in its own right. Indigenous Australians have shown other Australians the way in this regard. It is their profound understanding and love of this place that has, over time, transformed the non-Indigenous view of it from something to be feared and tamed, to something to love and protect.\nUnfortunately, the landscape is still a contested space: the site of ongoing Indigenous dispossession, the site of mass species extinctions and environmental degradation. When we turn for a sense of belonging to the land, to the country, we are inevitably reminded of our un-belonging, or of our dispossession.\nEven so, nature, perhaps because it is undeniably a healing thing, continues to anchor us here, to ground us as \u201cAustralians\u201d. For many, contested though it is, the beauty of the land eases that sense of exile, of not quite belonging, whether their families have been here for just a few years or a few thousand years.\nFor Ovid, it is the same. Slowly he comes to see the wild world as something to embrace, to cling to even, rather than something to fear. Ovid\u2019s great epiphany is that the untamed world is not a hostile place, but a new home where he can be free of the rigid structures of Imperial Rome. By venturing into an even further place, a greater exile, he becomes free.\nAn Imaginary Life is, in part, about an individual journey from a state of being cut off and apart from the environment \u2013 of wishing to tame and exploit nature, of being totally entangled in language and culture \u2013 to a state of being in intimate contact with the untrained, wild things of the world. It is also about a poet, in thrall of civilisation, realising that there are other ways to live and experience; ways that are beautiful and fulfilling.\nOvid comes to this realisation by following the example of the wild boy, someone for whom the environment is not something outside of himself but an expression of his own nature.\nThose themes \u2013 of belonging and exile, of how to relate to the environment and to those who are different to us \u2013 are core to the debate about what it means to be Australian today. An Imaginary Life does not provide a workable template for how to navigate the complexity of belonging and un-belonging, nor should it. It\u2019s a novel not a policy document.\nIt does, however, show us it is possible to imagine ways to do things differently, ways to live differently with each other and with nature. And once imagined, those other ways of living seem all the more possible.\nDallas J.

Even if you've had the event mentally planned for years, chances are things won't go exactly as you hoped. Between managing your in-laws, organizing the catering and making sure your future hubby knows what to do, those pre-wedding butterflies can easily turn into stress-induced hives.\nLuckily, you're not going to have to say \"I do\" in a medicated haze just to get through the day -- or the weeks leading up to it. We'll show you how spending a few moments in silence can release the tension of your wedding woes and why seeking help from (gasp) your betrothed could reduce your anxiety level while simultaneously strengthening your relationship.\nYour wedding is going to be a beautiful, wonderful experience, but all the stress that comes between saying \"yes\" and \"I do\" is almost enough to cause a girl to swear off fondant, flowers and family forever! Before you elope in what you'd forever be forced to think of as your \"wedding jeans,\" try sitting alone for a few minutes and meditating.\nWhile meditating, you can delve into what it is that's bothering you, or you may choose to visualize a nice, stress-free ceremony. You don't have to focus on any one thing (or anything at all, actually), but just sitting by yourself, with yourself, for a few minutes in silence each day can have a profoundly positive effect on your mood and overall outlook.\nIf the thought of meditating intimidates you, don't worry. You don't need to spend years fine-tuning your technique to reduce stress. A study found that newly practicing meditators' brain waves moved from the anxiety-riddled right-frontal cortex to the more relaxed left-frontal cortex, making the group generally happier and more relaxed than before they began engaging in the ancient practice.\nYoga is a great way to sneak in some exercise and meditation.\nIf the stress of organizing and planning your wedding is making you see red, you might want to consider trying to burn off some energy -- and anger -- the old-fashioned way, through exercise.\nExercise relieves stress, and you don't have to be an athlete to walk or even run around the block. Engaging in moderate exercise for as few as 30 minutes a day can improve your mood, so try to carve out some time to power-walk around the corner or pound the pavement over to your favorite caf\u00e9. As an added bonus, you'll tone up and maybe even lose a few inches before the big day.\nSome overzealous brides insist on planning their entire weddings. But then they feel jilted when they catch their beaus slaying aliens over Xbox Live when they're revising the seating chart again.\nIf this sounds like you, we're here to tell you that you can't have it both ways! Before you toss out his video games with that tacky old beer stein, talk to him about what you need and expect from him. Jot down a list of things you'd like him to help with, and keep him posted on deadlines and vendor meeting dates. Chances are he'll be glad to assist if you let him -- you just need to give him something to do."

The sixteen hours of sleep can help me recharge and be ready for my day. After all, have you ever see me tired, or exhausted like all of you,\u201d Bella said. \u201cOh.\u201d I walked quickly down the school hallway, realizing that if I didn\u2019t stop talking I would be late, then I might get detention. Then I would have to stay after school and miss my resting time, then they would get mad. I really don\u2019t want that. No, no one would give me detention, would they? They all know by now right? Well at least that random girl did. Yeah, everyone knows by now. I mean, why else would people keep coming up to me and asking me about it. Some people had known for a while. Ever since I got detention the first time for some dumb reason I can\u2019t remember. They did not get that mad about that though at first cause I put my self to sleep in detention five minutes before my rest time. But then, my teacher got mad and woke me up. Then they got really mad. But I just told everyone in the room that I sleep for more than half the day, when my teacher asked me why I was sleeping. Since then I had a few people come up to me and ask me about it, but lately numbers were increasing. I am guessing that the few people in the detention room told more people.\nI rushed to my class, just making it on time. I felt a sense of relief rushing through my body when I sat in my chair, still 60 seconds early, even though I knew they probably would not dare give me detention. After school, I came home and rushed to brush my teeth and get pajamas on, so I could go to sleep at four pm.\nI wake up at no later than eight, which gives me a good 15 minutes to get ready for school and shove some cereal in my mouth. One of the main questions people have asked me at school, if they ask me anything, is if I think it is as odd as everyone else is making it sound. A more main one though, is why do I feel so tired? Or why I want to sleep so much? First of all, I do not want to sleep so much, they do. I have no choice. But I have come to terms with that. I have been in this long enough to know my place, and my reality. Reality is the hard part. It can get really confusing telling them apart. One of the ways I can tell them apart is when I look on the clock and realize, or when the annoying kids in one of my schools comes up to me and asks me why I sleep so much. But of course I never say that out loud. I simply say something like, \u201cYeah I really just like sleeping.\u201d Then when people ask me if I think it is strange too or if I think it is normal. That is usually when I walk away.\nI have learned how to get away from the annoying kids at my school. I do not like being in a conversation with them for more than five minutes. If it goes past five minutes, my lack of time starts to hit me. I realize that my time is always limited. There is always the ticking clock in the back of my mind, and the front of it, and everywhere else, that will remind me. I know it is only a a few hours difference, but to me it makes all the difference.\nThis is a world of magic and ideas. With all their bright lights and technology. It is a world I can\u2019t stay in forever though, and even I know that. Me of all people. I know that. But in this world, along with all the magic and glory, there is also a clock. The clock. The existence of the timer. No one can stay here forever.\nI got my shoes on and started walking towards the bus stop. I don\u2019t feel like I got enough sleep. Well, I feel like I got too much sleep. But they do not. They never do. Why would they ever. They never had stopped trying to wake me up, or force me out of my reality. But this time they might be mad. I leaned my head against the bus window and laid my arms flat on my back pack, on my back. I had forty five minutes I could sleep. I do not know if that would help at all, but maybe. A few minutes can take up a lot of time. Every minute counts. I looked at my mental clock, then the physical one strapped around my wrist. I had been sleeping for fifteen hours and twenty eight minutes. Once I get past the sixteen hour mark, I will be able to live it up. Even if it is just for eight hours, that is a lot of time right? But until then I tilted my head back against my back pack. I felt all the magic, technology and electricity in the world driveling away. I fell asleep to the movement of my mother pushing me awake, then I drifted off.\ni am grateful for your writings Hilda. Please keep true to your callings & (when you are inclined) take us along with you.\nJust read this article. It states that too much sleep is just as harmful as too little sleep.\nThis entry was posted on March 31, 2019 by Hilde Kate Lysiak and tagged Hilde kate lysiak, Orange Street News, short story."

It's Providence.\nI hope you had a great President's Day.\nHave you ever had a friend that you knew was placed in your life at a certain time for a certain reason? I've had a few of those and let me tell you, they are precious gems.\nToday I got to spend some time with one such friend. Let me tell you how we met.\nOnce upon a time, I put an ad on KSL (sort of like Craigslist for Utah locals). I needed a few extra music students and thought this might be a good way to get some. I received one call. One. This mom was looking for a guitar teacher for her daughter. We set up a time and guess what? They showed up. At the first lesson I was a little . . . excited. I had just received my first offer for publication earlier in the week and just couldn't contain my excitement. So I told them. And my student's mom was like, \"Really? I'm a writer too.\" And the rest is sort of history. A long, blessed history. We've been friends for three years now, but it feels more like we are sisters. Really and truly. It's like I've known her forever.\nWell, you might think this is the happily ever after part, but you'd be jumping the gun. Almost two years ago, when we'd only been friends for about a year, she decided to move to Maryland. I was sad, but not too sad because I have a sister in Maryland. I knew I'd get to visit her someday. And I knew we would talk on the phone and stuff. But I was still a little sad.\nSo you see, it's more than friendship. It's providence. We even look like sisters. Love you, Mist!\nAnd if you're looking for a good book, check out her Austen rewrites. Pride's Prejudice came out last year. And her covers are amazing. So here it is."

I started to think about how your Command put a MPO on you even though I didn't want it. They said it would only be about 3 days, but it was 14. They said I could talk to you everyday, but I could barely get a hold of them and they only let me talk to you once (well that they knew of). We weren't supposed to communicate at all, but we did it anyway. The MPO started on a Monday and you came home for the weekend on that Friday night. When I saw you there walking in our front door my heart raced with relief and excitement. I had tried for 2 days to get a hold of your command and I didn't know what was going on. I was so thankful to see you, scared you'd get in trouble, but so happy! I cried when you hugged me. I had missed you SO much and I know you felt the same. That was why you took the chance. You wanted to be with me as desperately as I wanted you. It felt like you were gone on a deployment and we had been away for a long time. I remember how you felt, how you smelled, and how you made me feel so loved and needed. We hugged for what seemed like forever, neither of us wanting to let go. You held me so close that whole night. That whole weekend really. You came home the following weekend, too.\nThose two weekends were probably the best we've had in a long time. They were just so full of love and not being able to get enough of each other. I would actually use the word \"perfect\" to describe them. We haven't had many \"perfect\" times in the past few years. It was so nice, so comforting, so hopeful. How did it go from hopeful to this? Oh, dear God I wish that you were just in the barracks right now and any day you'd come home to us. I want to feel you in my arms again. I want you to say \"I love you\" without the tears and fear and most importantly without the goodbye that went with those words just moments before your life ended. I want to hear them in the excited way telling me you've missed me and are glad to be home. Home, hmm... Home doesn't really mean the same thing anymore. If \"Home is where the heart is\" then I couldn't be able to tell you where home Truly is because I don't know where you are. What I do know is that you are not where you should be and since my heart is with you it's lost to me until I'm with you again."

She closed her eyes and tried to clear her mind of all the busy-talk around her by the other passengers. She wanted only to concentrate on what lay ahead. This appointment had been weighing on her mind for months. Finally, today she would find out if the treatments had worked.\nTami found out six months ago she had breast cancer. She underwent a double radical mastectomy a week later, only to discover the cancer had spread to one of her lungs. She began chemotherapy and radiation treatments as soon as her incisions had healed enough. She hoped the treatment would obliterate the cancer left inside her body.\nTami had no family to speak of. Therefore, she relied solely on the support of her church family to see her through this trying time. They were her rock, her shoulder to cry on, her counselors, and her nursemaids on the days the chemo attacked her very core. She praised God daily for each and every member of that tiny little church. She feels she would not have survived this ordeal without them.\nEven today, as she travels this road of uncertainty, her two closest friends, Faith and Hope, flanked either side of her. Tami felt relieved they were eager to make this trip with her. She needed their strength today, more than ever before.\nTami opened her eyes and looked to each friend and gave them her bravest smile as the bus began to come to a stop. She shook like a leaf in a hurricane on the inside despite her brave front. On one hand, she could not wait to hear the results the doctors had for her. On the other, she was scared to death!\nTami and her friends sat in a small conference room a short time later. She scanned the room and noticed some paintings on the wall beside her. One print depicted the hand of the Lord reaching down from the heavens to hold onto the outreached hand of some desperate soul.\nShe felt her knotted muscles begin to relax as she studied the painting. Slowly, an overwhelming sense of peace settled around her. Her body, once chilled with nerves, now tingled from the warmth of the spirit of the Lord as He wrapped her in His mighty arms. As wonderful as this was, she was unsure if he was trying to tell her everything was going to be okay, or if He was only readying Himself to catch her when she fell. She praised the Lord for the knowledge He was there with her, no matter what the doctors told her when they arrived.\nbroke Tami from her meditation.\n\u201cMs. Thomas, sorry you had to wait.\u201d Dr. Myers, wearing his customary white jacket entered the room with a team of fellow doctors. Each of them made their way to Tami\u2019s side and offered a hand in greeting.\n\u201cIt is all right, Dr. Myers. The nurse said you had my results?\u201d Tami clasped her hands together tightly and shoved them between her knees.\nTami scanned the faces of the other doctors in the room. In each face, she found the same thing . . . shock .\n. . disbelief . . . amazement. She turned her gaze back to Dr. Myers. He now had such an exuberant smile on his face, Tami was sure his face would crack from the wideness of it.\nEmotion flooded over Tami as she realized God had dealt her a miracle."

                            "text": "I know you hear a lot of writers talk about \u201cdeadlines.\u201d It\u2019s something I\u2019m quite familiar with given that I once worked for a daily online magazine. Deadlines don\u2019t get any firmer than having to produce at least one fresh news item by 5pm Monday-Friday. But as an author, deadlines are a bit more flexible.\nEditors will often cut you slack if you ask for a few more weeks, a few days. They expect us to turn things in late, so they probably pad the due date in advance. We\u2019re temperamental artists after all (yeah, right).\nBut personally, I find the deadlines that really drive you crazy are the ones that are SELF IMPOSED.\nYou know what I mean, those nasty resolutions: I\u2019m going to lose ten pounds in two weeks; I\u2019m going to quit smoking by Ground Hog\u2019s Day; I\u2019m going to find a new job before I have to attend that awful conference. Or\u2026.I\u2019m going to finish these never-ending revisions by the time my birthday rolls around!\nMy b-day is February 10th. And I\u2019ve been working on these revisions since before Christmas. You may think, \u201cHey, that\u2019s not so long.\u201d But trust me, it is when you're working 12 hour days, when you\u2019re dreaming about removing paragraphs you never actually wrote, when you find you can\u2019t go to the gym because you need every last hour to write.\nThis book is consuming my life. And the thing is, I already wrote it! These were supposed to be revisions, but truly I can\u2019t even call them that anymore. It\u2019s more like the \u201cI\u2019m going to rewrite this book from scratch and drive myself slowly insane until I\u2019m eating paste and singing Downtown in my bathtub\u201d project.\nAnd I swear, I will get it done before I age another year. Or I\u2019ll end up aging 40 in the process.\nSo in honor of my eternal revisions, I\u2019ve decided to post an excerpt. Like I\u2019ve said, I\u2019ve never been big on Teaser Tuesdays, but I\u2019ve been living inside my head with this book for far too long.\nThe sound of the apartment door opening pulled my attention. I turned to see three guys who seemed to have stepped off the pages of GQ\u2014crisp button-shirts with starched collars (inappropriate for most college campuses) draped over black pants or dark jeans that might as well have had dollar bills sewn into the pricey fabrics. Two sported blond haircuts that were meticulously styled to appear effortless. The other had a dark buzz cut just an eighth of an inch shy of bald. And, of course, they were incredibly good looking\u2014too good looking. I didn\u2019t need to glance at my sister to know that she was swooning.\nHis deep baritone made my shoulders tense. I should have known Keira would invite strays who barely knew her name. She probably met him while medicating the migraines that formed after gazing in the mirror for too many hours.\n\u201cNice place,\u201d he said, his eyes narrowed as they scanned the room. Only it didn\u2019t appear though as if he was admiring the d\u00e9cor, more like he was sizing up the guests, his eyes lingering on the faces of the men in the apartment. When his gaze subtly shifted to his friends, I could sense some sort of nonverbal cue. My gut twitched. I might not have been a social butterfly, but I had a pretty good loser-detector. These guys were rating high on my scale.\n\u201cI\u2019m Ken. These are my buddies.\u201d He gestured to his friends with his hand as his dark eyes dropped to my chest. I crossed my arms. He had to be at least a decade older than me, though that probably didn\u2019t matter much. Perve.\n\u201cHey.\u201d He nodded to me as he licked his lips.\nI had to swallow hard to hold back the vomit.\n\u201cHi,\u201d Keira cooed, mistakenly thinking the gesture was for her.\nHer beer goggles were so thick she was actually batting her eyes at this freak show. I sometimes wondered how we were related.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you came,\u201d my sister added as two of her nursing friends rushed to her side. They looked just as smitten.\n\u201cYou guys want a drink?\u201d Keira held up the pitcher and smilingly flirtatiously.\n\u201cAre you serious?\u201d I snapped, sneering at her.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she defended, shrugging with innocent eyes.\nBut Keira ignored me, her eyes quickly focusing back on the newcomers. When she bit her lip seductively, I turned away. I had no desire to watch her throw herself at these losers. She was better than that, better than them. It would be nice if she realized it.\n\u201cHappy Mother\u2019s Day,\u201d I choked under my breath.\nDid you guys know GH is getting a new nurse\u2019s desk? They\u2019re blowing up the set for February Sweeps. And you know what\u2019s sad? I heard this latest tidbit on the national news. You know it\u2019s a slow news day when a soap opera set remodel makes entertainment headlines. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing what they come up with. Maybe they\u2019ll actually bring some doctors and nurses to the cast so the show\u2019s title makes sense again. Because after the past decade, I was certain they would\u2019ve changed it to \u201cThe Mafia Hour\u201d long ago.\nMy Worldwide Blog Tour, Bring on the Groupies!"

Faster and faster it spun, like a tunnel of circulating light. She became dizzy and disoriented. The many tones and colors that were alive in the vortex raised her vibration\u2014octave by octave\u2014until she felt as if she would burst. At the point which she could stand no more, the colors and tones permeated her form and transformed it into a vague human shape that was no more than a wisp of light. The swirling sensation then became internalized and she felt a million swirling vortexes fill her being. Each vortex spun at an increasing rate, creating a tapestry woven of the many components of her SELF. The spinning continued until the point of critical mass was reached and\u2014in a burst of light\u2014it stopped. She was in the void beyond the vortex.\nFor time beyond time, she remained in the void until a distant light began its journey towards her. Her Soul smiled, as she recognized it as Arcturus. With this recognition, the void became filled with millions of stars. She wished to again visit Arcturus, but as the stars came closer, they began to encircle her. Faster and faster, they moved until they blurred into another vortex, a vortex made of stars.\nThis vortex transformed into a tunnel with a stream of light flowing through it. Shature could see that this stream originated in a distant lake. Like a salmon following its instinct, she traveled against the flow of the liquid light. It drew her into it. She found a current in the very center of the stream that, if she surrendered to it, carried her up to the Source. She surrendered to this current and allowed it to fill her with its emanations.\nShe, too, was a drop of liquid light seeking its Source. As the stream within a stream continued its upward journey, she could feel the waters of life simultaneously flowing downward into the lower dimensions to gather experience. Onward she traveled past lake after lake. She felt the consciousness of Rahotep, How-ta-shai, and Matia, her lives in which she was a Spiritual Initiate, guiding her with their combined experience. Could she continue in their paths? Had she completed HER initiations?\nAlmost in response to her question, the liquid light stopped. Slowly at first and then gradually gathering speed, she felt the current taking her back, back into the lower dimensions. The current rapidly carried her, but she felt no fear. Rahotep, How-ta-shai, and Matia were within her, comforting her, assuring her. Suddenly, the current emptied her into a large lake. Instinctively, Shature knew she was in the third dimension.\nAbruptly, the lake disappeared, and Shature saw herself in a huge stadium filled with people.\n\u201cThese people are all you in your myriad third dimensional Earth realities. Feel the life force of each of them. Imagine that the bottom of the stadium represents the ancient times, and the top of the stadium represents the dawning of the new millennium, 2000 AD. From your omni-location of Oneness, you can choose any seat in the stadium to experience a particular reality. You may notice that, even though you are aware of all of these people, they are only aware of themselves, and the life in which they are absorbed. You have achieved multidimensional consciousness, and they have not.\n\u201cBut wait, is that Ileana and Francesca, two lives in which you suffered great sorrow and victimization, turning their awareness to your omni-present essence? And yes, the other wounded ones that you have visited are also aware of you. As you have awakened, they, too, have begun to awake.\n\u201cNow, fill this stadium to the top with liquid light, and it again becomes a lake, but each reality stays within the confines of its own time-space coordinates. There is a large waterfall that empties into this lake. Go now, stand under it and feel its waters upon you. Allow yourself to surrender to the influence of the liquid rays of light. Feel your frequency rising as you float up the waterfall, higher and higher, until you see another lake of liquid light.\n\u201cPull yourself into this lake. As you swim with the innumerable fish, imagine that they each represent a different fourth dimensional reality. The confines of time and space are not as rigid here, and each fish can move out of its initial location and communicate with the others around it.\n\u201cSome fish are beautiful and others look like sea dragons. Love each of them for the experience they offer you. If you wanted to, you could hold each fish and it would tell you the tale of its existence, but that would keep you in these waters for years and years of your Earth time. Instead, find the waterfall that feeds into this lake and allow its liquid light to raise your vibration again.\n\u201cAh yes, feel the familiarity of the fifth dimension. Is it not clear? As you pull yourself into this lake, you can see that it is filled with thousands of crystals that hold the divine blueprint for the realities also existing on the third and fourth dimension. Some of these crystals float in the liquid light and others rest upon the lake floor. Since the fifth dimension exists in the eternal Now, their location does not represent their time nor space. The crystals that are floating represent the realities in which you are a space traveler, and the grounded ones represent the realities in which you are bound to one planet. Yes, there are many floating crystals. However, you must release this experience, or you will not be able to continue your journey. Find your waterfall again, and stand under its flow.\n\u201cAs the waterfall raises your vibration to the sixth dimension, you feel less familiar with the experience. When you first ventured down from the Source, the glimmer of a group identity began to enter your consciousness and the Archetypes of the lower planes were born. Here, you live in group-consciousness, but you have a sense of yourself as an individual component of your archetypal energy. It is this archetypal energy that creates the foundation for each of your possible realities.\n\u201cFloat into the center of the lake, but keep a thread of your individuality so that you will not lose your self awareness. From here, imagine your omni-directional perception as you live in the Oneness. You are a drop of water, and you share your experience with every other drop. Feel the complete unity of All That Is. Now, gradually, allow the currents of the lake to carry you to the waterfall, and up to the seventh dimension of your Oversoul.\n\u201cYes, there is the waterfall. Feel its liquid light as it caresses the vague memory of the form you once held. As you allow yourself to rise in vibration, hold on to our voice so that you can translate your experience into the mind of Shature. Feel the vibratory rate of the seventh dimension, and allow it to enter your heart so that you may feel the message of your Oversoul.\nSuddenly, the vision disappeared, and all that remained was the void. Since there was no time, no space, no thought, no feeling and no form, Shature could have been there for all eternity or simply the blink of an eye. All was Spirit\u2014Pure Cosmic Force\u2014until, gradually, a sound began to permeate the total silence of the void. It grew louder and louder and kindled a recognition of something yet unknown. The deep peace and total serenity of the void bade all formless potential to remain within it, but the sound circled the nothingness and embedded into it, creating a thin filament of light in the form of a circle. With the birth of this circle of light, other filaments of light slowly began to materialize from the total blackness of the void.\nThese light filaments surrounded the small circle, causing a small flame to fan itself into existence in the center of the circle. Although the flame\u2019s consciousness was dim, its innocence drew more filaments of light to manifest from the void. In its first conscious act, the small flame transformed its circle into a heart and, in a sudden burst of light, the heart and flame were embedded into the matrix of a form\u2014a human form.\nAt each point where the network met, there was a tiny vortex. These vortexes slowly began to decrease their spin as the flame within the core connected to each of them. With each connection, the flame of life grew in its awareness and recognized that it was taking a form. With this recognition, the flame became a fire, and the fire became aware that it was the heart of a body of light.\nOff in the distance the sound returned. It was a cry, the cry of an infant. Not one that had been born, but one that was crying to be born. The cry became a pull, and the pull became a sensation\u2014a sensation of movement and of gradual materialization. The tiny vortexes of light that outlined the form spun slower and slower and pulled the light body to another vortex.\nWhereas the first vortex had been one of expansion, this was a vortex of constriction. Tighter and tighter, denser and denser, the swirling tunnel forced the body of light to fill in the matrix with consciousness. When the restriction was almost intolerable, there was a swishing sound and the tunnel disappeared. The darkness was filled with a million specs of light.\nStars, the Lightbody now perceived stars. The sound was coming from one of these stars, and that star pulled the Lightbody into its orb. The star was now a sun, which was encircled by nine planets and an asteroid belt. The second planet from the sun, which felt particularity like home, was somehow different. The consciousness had remembered it as a beautiful planet filled with life. Now it appeared to be an angry explosion of gas and mist. And the cry, it did not come from there. It came from the third planet. Yes, that planet had been known to the consciousness as Earth. The thought of Earth submerged the consciousness into an individuation known as Shature.\nShature blinked as if suddenly awakened. She expected to see herself sitting again on the patio with Matia, but her vision was instead filled with the distant view of Earth. She could see the continents and the blue of the many oceans. She saw its moon as it encircled the orb. From this perspective, Shature realized that, just as a network of light surrounded her, a network of light also surrounded planet Earth. In fact, she could now see the entire solar system outlined by the light matrix.\nThe resonance of a certain area upon the third planet felt so harmonious with her essence that it pulled her towards it. It felt comfortable\u2014like home. As she moved in that direction, she again heard the sound. Yes, it was a cry. She remembered now. It was this sound that had drawn her back from the void."

More often than not while listening to her music, it is fascinating and hard to wrap your head around the fact that the cinematic realm of the records is built entirely around the electric guitar \u2013 and by one single person. There are specific stretches \u2013 on efforts like Glacial Glow or Fantastic Planet \u2013 that are so stunningly realized and well-formed that it almost disturbs those of us who have listened to her for a long time. Disturbing in the way of \u201cWhy isn\u2019t this artist a household name by now?\u201d.\nArriving this past week is her eighth full-length, the pulsating A Pink Sunset For No One. Her otherworldly constructions have never felt more like a director; not only behind the boards, but behind the camera. It should come as no surprise to hear that Lipstate is also a filmmaker in her own right, and listening to the cavernous hums and swirling guitars, here, only makes you hope that she\u2019ll release a companion movie at some point in the near future. Noveller\u2019s records have always been best experienced on a quality sound system in a confined space, or at the very least with a good pair of headphones latched onto the ears. The nine tracks on this record simply call for this type of experience, and if you allow it to be unveiled this way then it will be significantly more rewarding.\nA Pink Sunset For No One is the finest effort yet from one of the more under-appreciated instrumental acts in all of music. By continuing to push toward the more sprawling landscapes in her songs, Lipstate has made Noveller one of the more sonically captivating, immediate-imagery-painting projects out there."

                            "text": "Maarja Nuut is an Estonian violinist who weaves her lilting voice around traditional folk compositions and contemporary electro-acoustic minimalism using a skeletal framework: voice, bow, looping pedal, click track. What fills in UNE MEELES (In the Hold of a Dream) is a distinct sense of wonder and technical mastery, lighting it from within like a faintly flickering candle in a window. Throughout the 12-track album, Nuut\u2019s violin is plucked like a ukulele, strummed, frantically bowed in additive passages of incoming-storm intensity and looped to create a hypnotic pastiche of lines that move with gathering rhythm.\nNuut is a great innovator and archivist on UNE MEELES. Several tracks display an ethnomusicologist\u2019s keen preservation of traditional Estonian folk melodies. Tracks such as \u201cEeva & Maarja labajalg\u201d serve to not only display the traditional melodies of Nuut\u2019s native Estonia but to also place Nuut in a long line of accomplished musicians able to keep pace with intricate bowing and swirling melodies while simultaneously looping passages to create an overwhelming chorus of dense, pointillist sound. On \u201cJaa-ti-daa,\u201d Nuut throws her voice to create a multi-layered lullaby of circling melodies of monosyllabic lyrics over the delicate plucking of her violin.\nThese melodies and traditional tunes feel lived in, as Nuut is a denizen, and not an interloper, of these tones and timbres. As an innovator, Nuut is able create wonderfully astute avant-pop creations that recall Final Fantasy, Kishi Bashi and Joanna Newsom. The delirious call-and-response of \u201cHobusem\u00e4ng\u201d is composed of multi-layered violin, looped vocals and rhythm, supplied by a distinct kind of mouthsound that recall the everything-is-music aesthetic of Czech weirdo-geniuses DVA. The song breaks into a cathartic peak, where each of these elements begin firing on all cylinders\u2014an impressively stitched-together cyclone of voice, violin and bodily rhythm that threatens to\u2014but never does\u2014fly apart in a splintering tornado of notes and body parts. \u201cSammud\u201d follows a similar pattern, constructing a shuffling-rhythm pattern through the field recording of shuffling feet. This usage of found sound recording elements, which seem novel today, has its roots in traditional folk music, which constructs multi-rhythmic narratives that are comprised of what was available at the time.\n\u201cKellatoas\u201d is a tiny world unto itself. The track is a strummed, plucked instrumental number focused around a singular musical passage while impossibly high-pitched drones swoop in and out. This recalls Amiina\u2019s gloriously pastoral ambient-folk and (listening while mourning the passing of Tony Conrad) resides moments under the sway of Conrad\u2019s otherworldly droning. As \u201cKellatoas\u201d segues into \u201ckiik tahab kindaid,\u201d Conrad\u2019s presence is channeled, even if unknowingly so, and drawn in through the looped dissonant passages: a rare moment of lament, a suitable dirge for the loss of a giant in the musical community."

On Sunday night, a very select group of Wolf Alice fans witnessed the store\u2019s transformation into an unassuming venue for a special acoustic performance from the London based four-piece band. In this spectacularly intimate setting, an audience of no more than fifty huddled around the makeshift stage for the stripped back performance.\nWelcomed by a whispery hello from lead singer Ellie Rowell, nervously perched upon the shop\u2019s counter, the band showcased their much-awaited second album, \u2018Visions of a Life\u2019. Launching into the melodic \u2018Sadboy\u2019, the powerful guitar riff set the foundations for Rowell\u2019s exceptional vocals; the haunting echo of her voice effortlessly floated along the moody, grungy lyrics.\nHaving hypnotised the crowd, the band produced more jewels, including \u2018Beautifully Unconventional\u2019. The lyrics, \u2018light as a feather\u2019, were aptly fitting for her ethereal voice. The set truly blossomed during the performance of the classic \u2018Bros\u2019. The delicate acoustic arrangement evoked a folksy tone and was met with adoration.\nThe highlight of the set had to be the closing song, \u2018Don\u2019t Delete the Kisses\u2019, a slow-burning track that stunned with a swirling, dreamy melody. A tale of unspoken love was beautifully narrated through her breathy spoken word monologue which erupts into the anthemic chorus. After a moment of silent awe at the end of their performance, the crowd burst into adoring applause.\nWolf Alice\u2019s unconventionally timid style underpinned the intimacy of the evening. They indisputably proved themselves exceptional live performers, arguably outdoing their incredible recorded material. Rowell\u2019s demure character was enchantingly intimate and dynamically supported by the talented instrumentalists.\nThe crowd were brought back to reality once the set finished, and excitement swelled as the signing began. Snaking around the familiar record stands after the otherworldly, intimately personal performance, we were reminded of the surreal nature of the experience.\nThe reality of meeting the band united the crowd in giddy excitement. Their serious onstage presence left, replaced with relaxed and cheerful personalities; they were nothing short of lovely. They took the time to chat to their fans individually and even smiled through the stream of selfies.\nThe evening was a testament to their brilliance and an incredible taste of what is to come in the performance at the Brighton Dome next month."

Every autumn, a South America-bound colony of Vaux\u2019s Swifts numbering in the tens of thousands enjoy a layover in a Portland, Oregon elementary school chimney. Sunset brings a vortex of swirling shapes, whose each tiny piece combines to form a hypnotic, ever-changing pattern; an equinoctial rhythm beats in every swoop of the organic overhead spiral. The defunct industrial chimney is our own demise, and yet the relentless, fluid choreography of the tiny migrants signals a new start, the turning wheel.\n\"Much simpler in its formal mechanism but no less mesmerizing was Vanessa Renwick\u2019s layover. The longtime Portland filmmaker trains her camera over an industrial zone for the annual migration of swifts. Their intricate patterns in the sky are frankly awe-inspiring, the kind of thing that moved the poet Robinson Jeffers to muse, \u201cDoes it matter whether you hate your\u2026self? At least/Love your eyes that can see, your mind that can/Hear the music, the thunder of the wings\u201d (Love the Wild Swan). Renwick\u2019s coda of a plane streaking across the moon would indeed seem to reflect a renewal of the senses, but I love layover for its hint of frailty: each time the awed camera bucks or racks focus to keep up with the flock, it\u2019s a reminder of our human weakness for wanting to hold what will not be held.\"\n\"Renwick also brought in hammocks and pillows for viewers to relax while watching a video about the Vaux's Swifts at Chapman Elementary School. Shot by Eric Edwards, the video shows thousands of swifts flying in a swirling vortex, accompanied by sitar-like drones in Sam Coomes' musical score. As the birds dive into the chimney to roost for the night, the music gathers rock 'n roll heft. The effect is mesmerizing.\""

I found that I could not meet Her eyes. Honestly, they frightened me a little\u2026 Deep green with many reflected surfaces\u2026 I felt raw & exposed. So I bowed my head, held my hands in prayer over my heart & waited for Her to speak.\nI held out my hand & She took it. Suddenly I was looking at myself. Standing before me with head bowed & hands in prayer position above the heart, was a shadow of myself embedded in an amazing display of light! It took me a while to understand the pattern, but when I did, it was indeed a beautiful thing to behold. It spoke to me of how my past has danced with my future, how my present never exists, how all of me can move in all directions at all points in time to all spaces that ever exist.\nThen I saw the movement, the flow & the colours of the lights. It was alive with activity, full of colours I have no point of reference for describing! There seemed to be a pulse, a rhythm to this movement, which I studied long & hard. Until it came to me, the ancient Song of my Soul. The words & melody that remind me of who I always am, what I always do & how I do it. The treasure had emerged from the weaving\u2026 And then She released me & spoke to me once more.\nThen She was moving back into the shadows, singing my Soul Song as She went. I sent out a prayer of thanks Her way & returned to my Earth Star meditation.\nDelving into Arachne\u2019s shadow brought rise to mystery, which led to fear, overcome by wisdom & accepted as a gift\u2026 for I will weave well the treasures of my spirit.\nBlessings on you all this Dark Moon night.\nSo many things are being pulled into my world, my vision, my consciousness. It feels like the various forms of processing our Earthwalk are being stripped of language & ownership, & being set free as a concentrated essence that is seeping through my skin! I feel the buzz as it enters my nervous system. It fills me. I want to explode. And then I do, usually through my heart first, a bursting of warmth that throws me back as it rips me open. Then I feel my feet become magnetised to the Earth so that I am left swaying in the atmosphere like a plant growing in a running stream. My head fills with blood & begins to pulse sending my Dreams & desires out into the Universe. My fingers tingle. My ears block out all external sounds & I begin to hear singing. I will always be left with a song or a melody from these moments. When this passes I feel elated, uplifted, regenerated, like every day of my life should be celebrated! From when I open my eyes to see all that has been created, to when I drift off to Dream knowing my life is what I made it."

But there was nothing threatening in that black, silent space, because she knew that something wonderful began in the next moment. Before her eyes could have adjusted to the darkness, a pale, blue ray of light appeared and illuminated a microphone stand on the stage. She swallowed hard as she came to know that she was not able to whist her sweeping blood in her veins.\nMusicians didn\u2019t play yet, but she already heard that well-known melody. She didn\u2019t hear the singer\u2019s silky but powerful voice that like melted chocolate flowed down to the throat, swarming across within. The artist didn\u2019t get on the stage, but she already saw him, although, in a strange way, from the stage not from the middle of the third row.\nShe looked down from the middle of the stage, where the microphone stand awaited for its master. She closed her eyes, shook her head to stop that strange envision, but when she raised her eyes, she were still standing in the embrace of that blue light. When she thought it was impossible, the heartbeat was getting stronger. But that sounded differently, that was not from inside. That was not her heartbeat any longer. In that time the speakers came alive. It sounded differently than her heartbeat, but was so familiar.\nThe crowd came alive and sighed like one man, and then a loud shouting with joy could be heard. The tension of awaiting burst out from thousands of people. And she heard and saw all of that! But she was not one of them from the crowd, because she didn\u2019t stand among them. She saw the excited faces in the light of the reflectors, saw them to laugh and cry and gaze at the stage \u2026 and at her.\nBut she saw their faces! She stood face-to-face with them! In front of them!\nShe was almost knocked over by the power of recognition. She stood on the stage! She, who was unable to perform to people, stood there on the stage, in front of thousands of people. She wanted to run away, but she could not do it. She could not raise her feet, found it too difficult to walk. She felt that the hot sweat of cold fear ran down on her back and she lost control over her senses.\nShe didn\u2019t hear the cheering of the audience or the music anymore. There was nothing but that blue light. It was she only saw. Over that she was blind and deaf.\nA voice flew to her from the distance. The Voice! It rang to her, sang for her. Don\u2019t give up!\nShe saw the crowd waving as one toward the stage, but she was interested only in the source of that voice. But the singer was nowhere to be seen.\nAnd then she caught sight of him. He rose up under the stage like a vision. What about she dreamt before, came true. She saw the curly, brown locks; the shining, huge, brown eyes; the full lips that formed that beautiful voice perfectly. The next second he stood in front of her and waved to the crowd, greeted the people, and continued singing. And then he moved toward her.\nThe recognition was overwhelming. She stood on the stage, but that was not for her, and she didn\u2019t belong there. She wanted to escape, but couldn\u2019t.\nThen the singer came a little bit closer to her \u2026 and held his hand out to her.\nHer senses failed. Cold flow of panic held her steadily. She closed her eyes and surrendered herself to her fate.\nThan a sweet spring breeze kissed her face gently. Slender, gentle, but strong fingers touched her shoulder, stroking it from top to down and up again. She opened her eyes like awaking from a dream. The song as a light breeze flew from between the singer\u2019s lips. She felt his breath touching her lips and she shivered with pleasure. Those fingers continued to caress her shoulder, arm and waist, and she felt like melted waxwork falling to the floor, because her legs were unable to hold her any longer.\nBut then the man seemed to sense her faintness and grabbed her with strong hands and lifted her up. He held her with steady hand and didn\u2019t let her to fall. He sang only to her while held her in his arms. They almost became one. She felt the smell of his perfume; his locks tickled her face: his practiced fingers were playing her body like a beautiful musical instrument.\nThey belonged together and couldn\u2019t exist without each other. They were the melody and the harmony. The singer and the microphone stand. Their sensual dance made the wonder."

But the music swirled around me and the piano maestro kept playing, unperturbed.\nThe melody was unknown, but fast and playful. The maestro\u2019s fingers danced and twirled over the black and ivory keys. The room was a tinderbox, all old wood and pages of vintage tales. The piano stood in the corner. I was sitting across the room in a dark green velvet chair, facing the maestro\u2019s back. In the corner adjacent from me sat a young woman, blonde, naturally pretty, with a distinctly French profile. Her head was buried in a small green book, not big enough to obscure her quiet sniffles and light tears.\nSuddenly, a loud finale and silence. The maestro turned suddenly. His eyes passed over me and rested on the French woman.\n\u201cWould you like me to play a happy song or a sad song?\u201d he asked in English. He smiled softly at her tears.\n\u201cA happy song, please,\u201d she responded in French, looking up and blushing.\n\u201cAll right, then!\u201d And he resumed playing another happy melody.\nI sat in my corner, taking it all in. He blissfully flung his fingers about, making the song look effortless, like liquid. While I listened, I absently noted the titles of the masterpieces shelved around me. Titles referencing Bastille Day, William the Conqueror, and Marie Antoinette lined the walls, mixed with narratives bound in dark hues\u2014midnight blue, forest green, rich maroon. I had wandered into this bookstore in search of shelter and a good hideaway, and I had found it among these tomes of French history.\nIt was my first time in Paris and I had heard tales of this expatriate haunt along the Seine. The bookstore carried both new titles and old wonders, and its passages remained a mystery even to the locals. I had refused the draw of the contemporary titles downstairs in favor of ascending the narrow staircase that groaned with the weight of secrets. At the top, I had found myself in the company of books aged like fine wine and vibrant music that drifted down the corridor and sent the dust dancing.\nThe music stopped. The maestro again turned to the French woman.\n\u201cParlez-vous fran\u00e7ais?\u201d he asked politely.\n\u201cOui.\u201d She smiled as he moved to the chair next to her.\nThey began to speak in hushed tones as a beginner took the maestro\u2019s vacated bench and tapped the keys with hesitancy. I tuned out the noise in hopes of catching their conversation, struggling to recall the French I\u2019d learned in years long past.\nLittle by little I pieced together their introductory conversation. The two seemed to have met at university, working on a project. I was ecstatic that I remembered enough to interpret this much.\nThey seemed so in tune with each other, I found myself hoping that they would leave with each other\u2019s phone numbers. This is the city of love, no? I smiled to myself.\nThere was a momentary lull in their soft conversation when the maestro\u2019s phone buzzed, reminding them of reality, time, and obligations.\nThe maestro checked his phone; the woman started to pack her bags. I felt hope stirring\u2014that the maestro would decide to walk her out, or steal a quick kiss as she left the shop.\nDon\u2019t you dare leave without her number. I almost whispered it out loud.\nShe stood to leave and slipped a piece of scratch paper his way. I had been so focused on willing him to make a move that I almost missed her nimble fingers boldly scribbling.\nThe maestro stood to bid her goodbye.\n\u201cMerci beaucoup,\u201d he whispered. He kissed her cheeks and lingered.\n\u201cAu revoir, mon amie,\u201d she whispered delicately in his ear.\nDevon spends the majority of her time procrastinating writing.

Voices were the waves that rolled over each other, and a thousand eyes decorated the sky. The heat was finally simmering, and the promise of rain draped over the falling night. Security stood at the ready, ushering ticket holders to their seats, and the aisles filled with hungry anticipation. Then, her voice rose high like wings soaring, touching down across smooth velvet, and talent lit up the stage. A star was seen falling with grace, gliding across the dreams that cling to our heart, and begging to be set free.\nHer voice touched my heart. The man behind me did not share my admiration, but it was his loss. The guitars strummed the chords to my soul, and I was swept into the melody. Fingers tapped against my knee, and my head bobbed to the beat. Lyrics lingered in the air, touching my lips, and the drums pounded with passion, fueling adrenaline. I was not alone as her music swept over the growing crowd, and a thousand eyes moved her way. We melted to the beauty of her heart and soul, to the fires of her passion, and we drifted over the edge and into sweet oblivion.\nAnd now I take a seat inside the Bleu Room with a Red Vase. The velvet curtain began to rise. Beauty in the red dress held the microphone gently in hand. Soft eyes traveled across the gazes of those waiting for the wings of talent to soar, and her voice rolled across the room like a welcoming breeze. Melody washed over words no longer left unsaid, releasing emotion from its cage, and falling deep into hearts and minds, stirring dreams, and we drifted into fantasy. And Lisa Bouchelle stole the night away at the Jones Beach Amphitheatre on a blazing July in 2010.\n13 tracks. I traveled across intricate rails, carrying me deep into the heart of her music. Her lyrics were whispers of wind slipping through glass windows, and her passion was the sunlight melting through the walls to my world. Depth was the tunnel that swallowed me whole but then slipped me onto the strings of the guitar, over the gentle tapping of piano keys, and into the pounding of the drums, and her songs were the passenger that rode beside me. Not a single one hit a bitter tone. Instead, this album was like a breath of fresh air, promise of a star to rise, and a whisper of a dream realized, and as I sat back in my seat and listened, I fell into the arms of pure inspiration, hope against the gray. And she continued on, rocking that rock that rocks the world.\nMelissa R.

A power that once released would set her heart racing.\nShe had never understood how the gentle touch of his hand could ignite her very soul with the most intensely powerful urges. Yet he always seemed to sense her deepest needs, as he lovingly coaxed her to a new level of pleasure.\nShe knew all too well his style, knew that he would tease her by holding her at her peak, before releasing her, bringing her back down and quieting her soul.\nShe could feel her very frame tremble in anticipation, as she awaited the sound of his fingers flexing in his gloves. Experience told her that he would pull her into an upright position, prior to mounting her.\nHe would then hold her in that position, flexing the fingers of his right hand, tightening his grip and taking her back to the point where she would again roar with an all consuming passion, inflaming within her a fire that would burst forth from the very heart of her body.\nShe hungered for that instant in time when he would once again make her soul soar with the unadulterated power that he and he alone, could release in her.\nThere had been others before her, there were younger ones who tempted him even now. He would always come back to her though, for she was his special one the one he called his \"Keeper\".\nHe had left her before but this was different, she was frightened, cold and alone.\nShe did not understand why he had left her here.\nDid not understand why he had stopped to look back at her, emphatically calling out her name before turning slowly away disappearing into the White light.\nIn the silence of his going she waited, yearning for his touch, the sound of his leathers creaking as he moved softly to her side.\nShe felt a degree of tension course through her body, in anticipation of feeling him run his hands along her frame, stroking, touching, gently caressing her body prior to mounting her and taking her to places she had never been before.\nShe had wanted to call out to him...but could not.\nNo she did not understand why her rider had gone.\nHe stood there, eyes closed. The only sound to be heard was of him breathing deeply of her fragrance, a fragrance which still lingered in the air.\nAs his breathing quietened he slowly opened his eyes and cast his gaze upon her. Her classic beauty never ceased to stir the fire in his blood, and he felt the familiar urges course through his veins as he yet again admired her graceful lines; the voluptuous body that he knew so intimately.\nEven though they had mellowed together over the years, his need for her was as strong now as it had been in the beginning.\nWith the memory of her scent still teasingly lingering in the corners of his mind he reached out to touch, for the very last time, her now cold form.\nClosing his eyes, he gently moved his hands, running them over her rounded smoothness, reveling in the feelings as his fingers traced the graceful lines of her form.\nHis breathing slowed as he rested his hands on the fullness of her curves, before allowing them to descend to the hollows where he would again pause allowing time for the memory of his touch to be forever set, deep within the recesses of his mind.\nWas just a moment in time, even as it seemed to him an eternity, as he gently caressed her, allowing the smoothness of her body to flow beneath his fingers, a body that he had loved so well.\nHe heard again the whisperings, the soft voices calling him, encouraging him to leave her. Slowly he withdrew his hands from her, satisfied her every curve, her very essence was etched forever into his memory.\nWith a sad smile brushing across his lips, he straightened before reluctantly turning away from her side, striding forward with a steady gait towards the ever beckoning light.\nThe time had come to take the walk.\nYet he was not ready to let her go. Trembling, he stopped, hesitating before turning to take one last look at her, sighing as his eyes rested on her familiar form, taking in her sculptured lines, remembering how with the simple turn of his fingers she would come to life.\nHe called out her name, beseeching her to acknowledge his love, yet knowing full well that she could not reply.\nThere was no going back. He must walk forward.\nHe knew all too well that she would never understand how he could have left her.\nWhy his love had deserted her.\nWhy She was alone and cold.\nShe was destined to wait forever more, longing for his return.\nAt the end of his last long ride.\nAt the end of his last long ride, he cast his eyes over her graceful lines and reached out to touch for the very last time, her now cold frame.\nHe stood there alongside her for what seemed an eternity, but twas just a moment in time. Slowly withdrawing his hand from her body, a body he knew so well, every shape, every curve etched forever into his memory.\nFor the time had come to take the walk!\nWith a sad smile upon his lips, he reluctantly turned away from her and strode, with a steady gait, towards the ever beckoning light.\nAs the light beckoned him forward, he could hear the voices of those gone before, calling him, whispering his name........he stopped and turned to take one last look at her. Once more admiring her lines, the smoothness of her curves, the sheer power in her frame.\nHe called out her name, knowing full well that she could not reply,as he tore his eyes from her for there was no going back.\nWith a heavy heart he turned, hearing once again the voices calling him forward, ever forward towards the light!\nThis was one journey that he would have to do alone, for his time had come and he could delay no longer.\nEven as he knew that his time had come, his love for her still beat strongly within his chest........ for he had given her his Heart, his Soul.\nEven as he knew that his love for her would curse him to ride forever the storms of this twilight world twix life and death.\nEven as he knew that he would never know peace, never be free to join those who had gone before.\nForever to be tormented by the voices calling out his name in whispered tones.\nEven as he knew that he would for eternty search this world for his lost soul....a Ghost Rider, doomed to forever ride the skies, never to be freed from his earthly ties.\nEven as he knew that he had given his Heart and Soul to one who was a vagrant solitare....herself one of the lost ones.\nEven as he felt the emptiness grow within him, he could no more stop loving her than he could alter his destiny.\nForever cursed, one of the Lost Riders trapped twix life and death."

It recorded clearly the time when the owner had passed through the toll.\nSu Zhinian said he was near the northern side of town when he called, right? So why would the receipt say he departed from the southern part of Beijing?\nSong Qingchun clicked on the call records in her phone. The time Su Zhinian called her was about ten minutes before this receipt was issued. In other words, he had only departed from the city after receiving her call?\nSong Qingchun stared unblinkingly at the paper in her grasp. Her eyes were still, but her heart was roiling with emotions.\nSo he hadn't been really geographically close to her when he called and purposely came to fetch her?\nIn fact, getting from where he was to her earlier location in the mountains, even if one was driving at the maximum speed, it would take at least four hours, but he had only spent slightly over one hour. Therefore, he had been breaking the speed limit throughout his entire journey?\nSong Qingchun was reminded of the sudden brake she had heard on the phone from before. From the serenity in his voice, she was lulled into a false comfort that everything was fine. Thinking back, she realized how dangerous it must have been!\nSong Qingchun's fingers that held the paper started to shake.\nActually, it couldn't be said that he treated her nicely. His tone toward her was usually cold and unfeeling. He had done the worst to trample on her honor and heart during that unfortunate night so many years. Even after they reconvened, he had used every method available to shame and humiliate her. Therefore, in her heart, she had the impression that he hated her, just like how she hated him.\nSong Qingchun's heart started to panic.\nThe car door was suddenly pulled open, and Song Qingchun was forced to come to terms with reality quickly. She slipped the paper into her palm quietly and turned her head around to look at Su Zhinian.\nThe man's cold gaze scanned her face, and he asked in his usual toneless manner, \"Not going to sleep anymore?\"\nSu Zhinian restarted the car and returned to the highway. With the content of the paper crowding her mind, Song Qingchun finally couldn't hold it in anymore. She asked, \"Where were you when you called me?\"\nSu Zhinian looked straight ahead on the road and answered calmly, \"Yang Lin Golf Course.\"\nSu Zhinian turned the steering wheel to switch into another lane to bypass a truck. Then he added, \"CEO Zhang from Lu Yang invited me to join him for a game of golf this afternoon, so I was already out of the city, and his golf course is at the northern countryside.\"\nSong Qingchun answered with an \"Oh.\"\nHowever, internally, she grumbled, You liar, you were still inside the city when you called! Liar! Liar Su!\nAfter that, Song Qingchun calmed down, and a frown formed between her brows. But why would he lie to me about this?\nSong Qingchun studied Su Zhinian through the rear-view mirror. The street lights bordering the highway on both sides framed his strong jawline and carved features in a dreamy glow.\nHowever, she also noticed a trace of tiredness on his face, and that was probably from hours of long-distance driving."

However, the hunt for the Chintamani isn\u2019t over and Soon Deok will find herself in the eye of the storm. The camps are being formed and the final confrontation awaits.\nUnless you become happy yourself.\nChae Yoon arrived at Moorim Institute and Beop Gong greeted him. Shi Woo noticed that Chae Yoon was the man who had treated him while he was searching for Soon Deok. Chae Yoon was there to see Seon Ah and Beop Gong informed him that she had found out recently that Moo Song wasn\u2019t her biological father. He became aware that Moorim Association was searching for the Chintamani key that was hidden somewhere inside Moorim Institute. All Chae Yoon wanted from him was to help him meet Seon Ah. In the meantime, Chi Ang was recalling Shi Woo and his father\u2019s words and he was lost between the two opposing views.\nShi Woo appeared in front of Chae Yoon who remembered him. Shi Woo urged him to give Seon Ah some time before seeing her because she wasn\u2019t at her finest and his sudden appearance would complicate things a bit more. Even though Beop Gong was enraged at Shi Woo for interfering Chae Yoon approved of Shi Woo\u2019s request.\nShi Woo informed Seon Ah on the latest events and she could understand to a wider extent that her whole life was a lie. She didn\u2019t know whether Moo Song\u2019s words towards her were true or not and Shi Woo pointed out that the real answer was inside her heart since Moo Song had always been there for her.\nShi Woo informed Chae Yoon that it wouldn\u2019t be a good idea for him to meet Seon Ah and he would wait until the right moment would arrive. However, Shi Woo was curious why he was there with Runa who was one of Sang Hae Group\u2019s people and Chae Yoon became aware that Wang Hao had kidnapped Soon Deok because he had mistook her for Seon Ah. Shi Woo continued Wang Hao\u2019s story in which Moo song was supposed to had set Chae Yoon\u2019s house on fire before taking Seon Ah with him. Shi Woo laid emphasis on the fact that Moo Song was there to save Chae Yoon, but he was too late.\nShi Woo put his trust in Moo Song and Seon Ah appeared on the upper floor to stare at her biological father while recalling her conversation with Moo Song. She thought that she had understood pretty much everything about Moo Song, but she was unable to witness his stare and ask him for the truth. Seon Ah had already started doubting her own assumptions to the extent of hating herself. Shi Woo had also told Chae Yoon that Wang Hao was behind Juk Poong in order to acquire the Chintamani by any means necessary, but once Runa asked Chae Yoon what they had talked about he told her that Shi Woo was just concerned about Seon Ah.\nMoo Song visited Bong San who revealed that he was at the flaming house 18 years ago and informed Moo Song that these men were after the Chintamani. All Moo Song wanted to find out was the truth concerning what had happened that night. Even though he had saved the child he couldn\u2019t forget what had happened, but he recently found out that the child had been alive all this time and was attending Moorim Institute with Soon Deok. Moo Song became aware that Shi Woo was the child Bong San had saved from the fire. Moo Song urged him to keep the secret to himself because these people had already started searching for the boy and were keeping an eye on Bong San.\nChi Ang had to return to Shanghai, but he warned Wang Hao\u2019s right-hand man that he wouldn\u2019t stand still in case he kidnapped Soon Deok again.\nSeon Ah was staring at the picture of Moo Song, Chae Yoon and her mother and in case she\u2019d see Moo Song again she wouldn\u2019t like him to witness her being sad. She would also like to ask her father why he was with Sang Hae Group\u2019s people while at the same time she couldn\u2019t hold back her tears while referring to Moo Song as her father.\nThe new teacher had also brought her own students who were training with Moorim Institute\u2019s students and Jenny got hurt. It was Sang Man\u2019s turn, but Shi Woo took his place and started fighting without a weapon. Shi Woo kept evading the attacks and put an end to the fight shortly after. He informed the teacher that she had been wrong all along the way since everything they had learned in Moorim Institute had nothing to do with fearing power and weapons. He pointed out that she was trying to oppress people by any means necessary in order to gain more power, but he wanted to harm her in the exact same way and the way. However, feeling like that was the only thing he was afraid of. This was Shi Woo\u2019s final warning since he didn\u2019t want to keep seeing his friends getting hurt. Seon Ah was witnessing what was going on and she was proud of him.\nMoo Song visited the chairman of Moorim Association who was well aware that Wang Hao had been taking care of Chae Yoon all this time. The chairman pointed out that if Chae Yoon was on the same side as Wang Hao something terrible could happen, but Moo Song wanted to meet Chae Yoon in order to reveal the whole truth. The chairman needed information concerning Chae Yoon\u2019s son and the Chintamani key in order for Moorim Association to succeed, but Moo Song wasn\u2019t after success. He didn\u2019t want anyone to get hurt, but Moo Song eventually revealed that Shi Woo was Chae Yoon\u2019s son. The chairman urged him to remain cautious for a while until he would arrange a meeting with Chae Yoon.\nChi Ang returned to Shanghai and he recalled Soon Deok\u2019s words. He wanted to know the whole truth from his father. Wang Hao showed Chi Ang one of the Chintamani key parts and pointed out that the one Seon Ah possessed should be in Moo Song\u2019s hands for the time being whereas the third one would be in Chae Yoon\u2019s son\u2019s possession. That was the reason why Chi Ang was sent to Moorim Institute and Wang Hao pointed out that if Chi Ang wasn\u2019t willing to cooperate then he would be useless to him. He kept believing in Chi Ang and reminded him of his promise. All Chi Ang wanted to know was the truth because he was desperate and he reminded his father the way he had raised him, like a child that would become a lion cub to survive if he was all alone in the jungle.\nChi Ang wondered what would happen to himself and his mother if he wasn\u2019t willing to follow his father\u2019s orders and Wang Hao told him that he should succeed at all costs for his family\u2019s well-being. He was willing to bring Chi Ang\u2019s mother at his mansion right away in order to prove his good intentions and he pointed out that he wasn\u2019t behind what had happened 18 years ago since he wasn\u2019t aware of Chintamani\u2019s existence back then. Chi Ang revealed that he loved Soon Deok whom he didn\u2019t intend to abandon like his father did to his wife. Wang Hao laid emphasis on the fact that people who were happy weren\u2019t able to possess power because they were being overrun by their feelings and he reminded Chi Ang that he wanted to become stronger.\nBong San informed Soon Deok that losing his sight was related to Shi Woo. Even though he wanted the Chintamani he ended up saving the boy, but he had left the child in the woods and had ran away to save his life. Losing his sight after being attacked was something he acknowledged as his punishment for abandoning the boy, but he was relieved to find out that the child was alive and well. Soon Deok found out that he was referring to Shi Woo and her father couldn\u2019t hide the truth from her because he was well aware that she loved him. Soon Deok was losing herself in tears as she couldn\u2019t believe that Shi Woo had to suffer because of her father who had abandoned him, but her father had to survive for her and Soon Deok put all the blame on herself.\nShi Woo was at the bell tower armory and Seon Ah went to meet him. She was thankful and apologetic at the same time, but he was the one who was truly thankful because she went out of her room.\nShi Woo was feeling uneasy in his sleep and Soon Deok entered his room and caressed him while telling him that she was there because he had called her. He was well aware it was a dream, but he was glad seeing her. She took him in her embrace and urged him to stop having nightmares, but she was also apologetic for everything that happened to him because of her. Shi Woo woke up in his empty room.\nWang Hao became aware that Chi Ang had returned to Korea and the way things would progress would be up to him. He wanted his right-hand man to assist Chi Ang, especially now that Wang Hao had made sure that his son wouldn\u2019t step away from his mission. He received a phone call and Wang Hao\u2019s return to Korean was unavoidable. Chi Ang had the Chintamani key part with him.\nThe students were happy seeing Seon Ah out of her room once again and Choi Ho who had returned was apologetic towards her about Moo Song. A moment of unity had arrived now that the finest student of Moorim Institute had returned!\nSeon Ah found a letter from Soon Deok and she rushed to meet Shi Woo. It was her only way to tell them everything and Shi Woo and Seon Ah found out that they were siblings while Soon Deok was deeply apologetic as well. Shi Woo and Seon Ah couldn\u2019t believe what was going on whereas Soon Deok was on a bus. Seon Ah put her memories alongside Shi Woo\u2019s and everything was making more sense since both of them had survived from the same fire and the melody she was playing on the piano was the lullaby their mother was singing for them. Seon Ah was also the one to had brought him at Moorim Institute and she pointed out that they should take things slowly from that moment and on.\nIn the meantime, Chi Ang was losing his mind since he couldn\u2019t decide what he should do. Shi Woo was recalling a wide variety of memories related to his past and the Chintamani, but once he recalled Chi Ang\u2019s words that his father was capable of anything to acquire what he wanted he started running. Moo Song followed the men from Moorim Association whereas Chae Yoon was sleeping inside Runa\u2019s car. She received a phone call and Chae Yoon pretended that he would stay behind to get some rest, but he started following her. He received a phone call from the chairman who wanted to talk to him about something that should be kept as a secret.\nChi Ang was glad that his mother was invited to China by his father and he reassured her that everything was fine. She would return to China first and Chi Ang urged her to think of the times they\u2019ll spend together once he comes back. He was curious if she would be really happy moving in his father\u2019s house and all that mattered to her was the fact that Chi Ang would join her soon. After the phone call reached the end Chi Ang was losing his mind as he kept wondering if he should keep his promise to his father.\nShi Woo went to Soon Deok\u2019s house to find out that nobody was there and he recalled the moment he told her that they would never break up, but he wondered why he was so sure about his feelings when he had uttered these words. Suddenly, everything was feeling so uncertain and he couldn\u2019t believe that the moment he had told her he loved was something that would eventually make her leave.\nWang Hao was nearby and once he was informed that Moo Song had arrived the doors were locked and Wang Hao\u2019s men appeared. Eventually, the chairman arrived as well. Chae Yoon recalled his conversations with the chairman now and then and the face he had witnessed back then was the chairman\u2019s. The chairman was the one who had planted the seeds of mistrust towards Moo Song. When the chairman was on his deathbed Wang Hao had visited him while being aware that he was behind Juk Poong. He was intending to heal him with the Chintamani and all he wanted back then was for the chairman to give him the key part he had in his possession. Wang Hao wanted to find out where the last key part was and the chairman reassured him that Chae Yoon wouldn\u2019t appear because he would be waiting for him inside his office.\nMoo Song was fighting Wang Hao\u2019s men, but Seon Ah and Shi Woo\u2019s faces were filling him with courage. Runa entered the game and when things were about to be over Chae Yoon appeared to defend him. The moment Runa tried to stab Chae Yoon, Moo Song shielded him with his body and got stabbed instead of his friend. Chae Yoon paid Runa back in her own coin and helped Moo Song who was apologetic for not protecting him the way he just did. Moo Song informed him that Shi Woo was his son who was alive and well and Moo Song was glad that he had taken after Chae Yoon. Moo Song told Chae Yoon that the other piece was inside the school.\nSeon Ah was recalling her conversations with Shi Woo which were Chintamani oriented. She noticed the seal\u2019s magical energy coming out of Moorim Institute\u2019s emblem on the floor and wondered if something bad had happened to her father. Wang Hao was informed that Moo Song was missing and Wang Hao was enraged. The chairman informed Beop Gong that Shi Woo was Chae Yoon\u2019s son and shortly after Wang Hao\u2019s right-hand man pointed out that Moo Song and Chae Yoon were nowhere to be found.\nChi Ang met his mother at the airport and he couldn\u2019t follow her right away because of his promise to his father, but he urged her to stop worrying. He wanted to find out if she would be happy living with his father and she was apologetic towards him for asking her if she was fine all these years. She urged him to be happy since he would never feel happiness through someone else\u2019s happiness and she took him in her embrace.\nShi Woo was inside Soon Deok\u2019s empty house and Wang Hao informed Chi Ang that Shi Woo was Chae Yoon\u2019s son who had the last key part in his possession. Chi Ang recalled the pendant Shi Woo was wearing around his neck and the fact that he had given it to Soon Deok. He reassured his father that he would bring him the last key part but things had just become even more difficult for Chi Ang.\nBeop Gong was losing his mind searching inside Shi Woo\u2019s room and he wanted Seon Ah to tell him where Shi Woo and the Chintamani were. He told her that Shi Woo was her brother and Seon Ah warned him that she wouldn\u2019t let him ruin Moorim Institute to a wider extent. Choi Ho informed everyone that Moo Song had returned and he wasn\u2019t alone since Chae Yoon was holding him. Beop Gong couldn\u2019t believe what was going on and one of the teacher\u2019s underlings tried to assassinate Moo Song but Chae Yoon pushed him away with his magical ability.\nChi Ang was recalling Shi Woo\u2019s words that Soon Deok was the whole world for him and even though he wasn\u2019t certain if he would be able to make her happy he was happy being with her in the world they were living in. Chi Ang arrived at Soon Deok\u2019s house to find out that only Shi Woo was there. He became aware that Soon Deok had left and he asked Shi Woo if the pendant he had given her was the Chintamani key part.\nChi Ang pointed out that he knew pretty much everything and he accused Shi Woo for putting Soon Deok in danger, but Shi Woo pointed out that Chi Ang had no right to say something like that. Shi Woo laid emphasis on the fact that he would punish anyone who would hurt Soon Deok even if that someone was his friend, but Chi Ang told him that their friendship was no longer valid.\nThe 15th episode presented the drama\u2019s second worst ratings to date for the 2nd time in a row as it rated 2.8%. Even though it wasn\u2019t embraced in Korea, Moorim School managed to become the guilty pleasure of many drama addicts around the world. Moorim School\u2019s captivating vibes kept resonating throughout the whole duration of the episode with suspense, revelations, intense feels and a cliffhanger that was declaring the explosive aura of the forthcoming episode that would close the drama\u2019s curtains.\nSetting aside our characters\u2019 concerns in solitude, the 15th episode\u2019s dynamics shone through the distinctive duets that made their appearance on screen.\nThe 15th episode didn\u2019t leave behind unanswered questions. On the contrary, it put together all the pieces of the puzzle when it comes to everyone\u2019s background stories. All that remains is to witness the final confrontation between Moorim Institute\u2019s virtuous beliefs and Moorim Association and Sang Hae Group\u2019s shady approaches with the Chintamani remaining the item of interest. The first ones want to protect it whereas the second ones want to use it to benefit themselves by any means necessary and in the most effortless way.\nSeon Ah coming out of her bedroom which had transformed itself into a cage that was keeping her soul enchained was a glimpse of her renewal and Shi Woo played his own part with his mind-awakening and insightful approach. Moo Song had been a paternal figure for her throughout the years and protected her in any way he could because he was deeply aware of the dangers that were waiting for her outside of Moorim Institute which was her whole world. It was the only place she had ever known after Moo Song saved her by putting his life on the line for his friend\u2019s daughter. Moorim Institute may had felt like a prison to her at times, but most and above all it was a veil of love and caring on Moo Song\u2019s behalf.\nWhile Moo Song was waiting for the right moment to reveal the whole truth Seon Ah had started losing herself in the poisonous words that were surrounding Moo Song\u2019s name and the only world she ever knew had been shattered in a blink of an eye. Her devastation was something logical since the tremendous amounts of pain she had received had clouded her mind and all the lies she had heard had shocked her to the extent of having a deeper impact than Moo Song\u2019s stare which was pleading for understanding. Seon Ah was able to restore the fragile balance deep within and she could see Moo Song once again as the paternal figure she always knew while still searching the courage that would lead her in front of her biological father; Chae Yoon.\nI was really hoping that Chi Ang wouldn\u2019t surrender to his father\u2019s shady ambitions, but his character appeared gullible, frivolous and directionless. There were countless signs throughout the previous episodes that were betraying his father\u2019s real nature, but Chi Ang kept refusing to see them even though they were more than apparent. He denied the opinions of many people that were sincerely caring for his well-being and he chose to remain in the sphere of influence of that one person he shouldn\u2019t have kept following. It is true that a part of himself kept fighting back the person he had become. However, it felt as if he wasn\u2019t really looking for the one and only truth, but he was longing for his father\u2019s excuses to sound like the truth that would justify everything he had in mind.\nWang Hao certainly manipulated him by fueling the fire with cards we were already aware of; his mother acquiring the position she deserved by Wang Hao\u2019s side and Chi Ang becoming as strong as his father. The way i see it, Chi Ang appeared as if he wanted to be used by his father in order to please his sickening obsession which was no other than having Soon Deok by his side by any means necessary and without taking into consideration her own heart and point of view. Power and happiness don\u2019t walk hand in hand and Wang Hao\u2019s words that people who were happy couldn\u2019t posses power because they were being overrun by their feelings were quite wise despite the fact that he used them to make Chi Ang focus more on what he should do.\nWho really cares about power when he\u2019s happy and self-sufficient? Nobody. Chi Ang was neither happy nor self-sufficient and the fact that he kept nurturing his sickening and groundless obsession was making him lean towards the direction of obtaining more power because he thought he would have everything even though his life would be empty. He was also unaffected by his mother\u2019s heartfelt words that he should find his own happiness if he wanted others around him (including herself) to be happy. Not for the others\u2019 sake, but for himself because the positive vibes he would start evoking would also affect others in a like-minded way. Chi Ang chose to remain blind and he demolished any sane bridges that were connecting him to the reality he should start living in instead of the imaginary and senseless world he was constructing in the shadow of his father.\nJust like Seon Ah\u2019s mind had been clouded by the lies she had heard about Moo Song the same applied to Soon Deok the moment she found out that her father had saved but abandoned Shi Woo in order to remain alive for her sake. Soon Deok putting all the blame on herself was a moment in which noble idiocy made its appearance, but the truth she had heard wasn\u2019t less shocking to be honest. Everything going on lately and the fact that she had left Shi Woo and Moorim Institute behind had overburdened her and everything her father revealed was the icing on her doleful cake. I have to admit that i laughed a lot the moment she was in tears and asked her father why he hadn\u2019t returned to take Shi Woo with him because i was like \u201cknock knock, he had lost his sight, hello?!\u201d but that\u2019s another part of the story.\nJust a few scenes before Soon Deok\u2019s letter would arrive the emotional ambiance was already fortified. Shi Woo was craving for her presence in his life and even though she couldn\u2019t be there for him in real time she visited him in the dreamworld where everything\u2019s possible. I had read somewhere that if you see something in your dream which had traces of reality, especially if it was something you wanted so badly to happen, then the opposite would come your way and this is what happened in this occasion because Soon Deok had decided to leave after apologizing and revealing Shi Woo and Seon Ah\u2019s deeper bonds through the letter.\nEverything related to the past that had appeared as a coincidence had become their common memories in a more palpable way. Seon Ah bringing Shi Woo at Moorim Institute was just the awakening of the fact that they were sharing something deeper than they\u2019d ever expect. Everything was gradually reaching completion, but something was missing and Soon Deok\u2019s absence the moment Shi Woo went to her house preserved the incompleteness of the moment as he kept reminiscing the promises he couldn\u2019t live up to at the present.\nShi Woo protecting his friends and delivering all the necessary vibes to the new teacher, Choi Ho returning to Moorim Institute and everyone surrounding Seon Ah with love, Chae Yoon protecting Moo Song who eventually shielded him with his own body, Seon Ah declaring that she wouldn\u2019t let Beop Gong ruin Moorim Institute even more and Chae Yoon preventing Moo Song\u2019s assassination in front of everyone\u2019s eyes while Shi Woo was in search of Soon Deok were a miniature of the greater picture; strength through unity. The forces of Moorim Institute along with everything it kept teaching and preserved all along the way were finding their way back home to protect everything that was dear to them and secure the Chintamani from all the impure hands that were shivering in ecstasy even at the thought of getting closer to it.\nChi Ang kept preserving his senseless flow of thoughts and put all the blame on Shi Woo now that Soon Deok was about to find herself in danger due to the Chintamani key part, but he was refusing to see the one and only truth that the ones who were putting Soon Deok in danger were no other than Sang Hae Group, Moorim Association and eventually himself. Acting as a savior while he was nothing more than his father\u2019s most well-trained hunting dog was something that enraged me since he didn\u2019t intend to step back after denouncing his friendship with Shi Woo. On the other side of the fence, Shi Woo kept preserving his love for Soon Deok while still thinking of Chi Ang as a friend, but without this meaning that he wouldn\u2019t go against him in case something were to happen to Soon Deok. Shi Woo had always been specific about his feelings towards everyone whereas Chi Ang was always being seduced by his obsessions that were making him follow the strongest wind that was scattering his personality. Alright, the time to watch the 16th episode has arrived!"

In August of 1932, Bertha Raffetto stayed up late into the night writing the majority of this song (until 4am to be exact). She had accidentally marked her calendar wrong and discovered that the event she had been invited to sing a song about Nevada for \u2013 the annual picnic for the 'Nevada Native Daughters' held at Bower's Mansion \u2013 was the very next day! Months prior, she had determined to write a new song because she couldn't find a song that quite expressed her feelings about her home state.\nWith little sleep, the next day she sang her new song from the balcony of the Bowers Mansion. Governor Morley Griswold and former Governor Roswell K. Colcord, who were both attending, liked the song so much that Bertha recalled of the event: former Governor Roswell \"propped his gold-headed ebony cane against the old square piano, removed his high topper from his leonine-head, and looking every inch the statesman, said to me, 'Honey, that's the prettiest Nevada song that I have ever heard. It should be made the State Song of Nevada!' And that's exactly what it became.\" -April M.\nIt's the loveliest place I know.\nWords & Music by Bertha Raffetto, 1932."

                            "text": "Hachiro snorted, his heartsong slipping past his lips quietly. His head was lowered, and his mane was falling into his eyes. His eyes sparkled in a timid way, and his hoofbeats were nearly inaudible. His tail swished back and forth gently, and he lifted his head, the words of his song coming from his mouth, right from his heart, evoking the emotional reaction he got whenever he sang this song.\n\"Are you searching for me? Why did you go; I have to stay. Now I'm reaching for you... Will you wait, will you wait? Will I see you again?\" The words became louder as he put his heart into his song, wondering where the other mares had gone. He hadn't smelled a mare in a while. His voice silenced slightly before he began singing again: \"Why did you go? I have to stay. Now I'm reaching for you...\" When his heartsong stopped, he suddenly asked himself, \"Where are you?\" He wasn't talking merely to his to-be soulmate, but to himself. He'd been lost ever since the... accident, as he referred to it.\nHis mother had been killed by a cougar, trying to protect him. And ever since then, his bipolar nature took over his senses. He became easily angered, then easily offended, easily hurt. Hachiro stared in front of him. All he wanted now was another mare to love; another mare who would love him in turn, just like his mother had. He wanted to fill the void in his heart his mother had left. He wanted to feel the wonderful love his mother had given him: he wanted a mare who would accept him no matter how he acted sometimes.\nHe knew finding his soulmate would be harder than he would want. Not many horses--stallion or mare--stayed around him very long. He wanted a mare who would accept him for who he was, and suddenly, as he opened his muzzle, lifting his head and singing seemingly up to the heavens, his heartsong spilling from his lips.\nStardust wandered through the hills. She had heard once, that these were the singing hills, where creatures came to sing and find their soulmates. Still, each time she had come, they had seemed empty and silent. Lonely, in a way-but it really made no difference to her. She had been alone quite a while, wandering on her on own. Her home, where she had been born, had suffered a terrible drought. Many stayed, hoping the rain would return, along with the food, but she had gone, though she was still quite young. But since then, she had remained alone, wandering, seeking a place to call home.\nWalking on through the hills, she was surprised to hear the sound of voice-a male voice, singing out. She paused, her ears swiveling as she listened, before she began to move toward it, her own voice carrying through the hills as she began to sing, willing to take a chance, even if didn't end up working out.\nHachiro's ears pricked forward, his head coming up and his neck-bone going rigid. His ears swiveled around in every direction, trying to put a pinpoint location on wherever the heavenly sound was coming from. His dun coat shone brightly under the sunrays, completely betraying the stallion he really was. His mood immediately bounced from down to up, as a result of his bipolar nature. He hoped that whoever this mare was would be willing to put up with his mood swings. Then again, it was unlikely she'd want to be around him. His heartsong wasn't the cheeriest of heartsongs, for sure.\nHe snorted and trotted towards the noise, coming over a hill and looking down, his stance being held regally as if he were a king. He shook out his mane and stomped his hoof, his muscles rippling under his dun coat. Looking down on the momentary dip in the landscape, he spotted a mare. She was a beautiful mare: a shining bay color. Her coat gleamed very much like his; or perhaps that was simply his perception of her. He opened his maw once more, letting out a single line of his song, \"Where are you?\"\nThe tune was short, sweet, and to the point. He pranced down, his legs lifted high with each step, as he brought himself down towards the mare. It was an uneasy tension of possible rejection that caused his stride to lose some of its pep, and by the time he reached the mare he'd slowed himself to a dull and easy-swinging walk. His head was lowered considerably than from what it'd been atop the hill, but he raised it to look her in the eyes. She had beautiful eyes, as well.\n\"I'm Hachiro,\" he said, tossing his mane and letting out an indifferent snort. \"And who may you be to give me the honor of your presence?\"\nStardust spotted the stallion approaching as he sang out one line of his song. He stood proudly at the crest of the hill, but as he approached her, moving down the hill, his gait became more uneasy, his head held lower. She looked him over-He was quite handsome, really, his dun hide shining in the sun as he approached. Of course, looks were far from everything-she'd hate to be stuck with someone she couldn't stand.\n\"My name is Stardust,\" She told him, dipping her head politely, \"It is a pleasure to meet you, Hachiro.\"\nHachiro positioned himself in a more confident manner; she was the first mare who hadn't turned and left him at first sight. Most mares judged him by his heart song, which really didn't fit his bipolar mood swings. A wave of apprehension hit him and he shifted on one hoof nervously, listening to her with ears pricked forward and tail flagged.\n\"That's a lovely name,\" Hachiro said, smiling brightly. Of course, he was trying to flatter her, or impress her, or something, but his attempts weren't wholehearted. He hadn't met a mare yet that could put up with him, so what would make her any different? Ignoring the thoughts that he had in his mind, he tried to come up with a good conversation starter that wouldn't make him sound like a complete idiot, like 'why are you here?' It was quite obvious as to why, so he'd have to think up another question.\nHachiro lifted his head and looked elsewhere for a moment before staring back at her coating with a look of obvious admiration in his eyes. \"Your coat looks quite well-kept,\" Hachiro commented, bringing his muzzle to her shoulder, but only for a moment. It was well-kept indeed: shiny, soft-looking, and it just gave off an air of rippling health. It was nice, he thought. He smiled at her, hoping his compliment made any sense at all, because the more he thought about it, the more stupid it sounded."

Sometimes I think, \u201cI would be so much happier if I had a boyfriend.\u201d When I choose to dwell on that thought, I am basically telling God that His plan for my life isn\u2019t cutting it. If only God would take some of my advice and give me a man, then I would be happy.\nYikes! I think it\u2019s time we reminded ourselves of who God is and what He is about. My pastor sums it up with these four simple facts about God.\nWho better to trust with our love life than God? He loves us with a perfect love and sovereignly works all of life\u2019s circumstances for good. He contains all wisdom and has a unique plan for each of our lives.\nWhy would we ever question such an incredible God?\nHe sees the future and knows who and what we need in our lives to help us glorify Him most.\nWhen it comes to having a guy in your life, you have to choose to do what Annie did. You have to share the desires of your heart with God and then leave it in His control. You have to trust that God knows you better than you know yourself, and in His perfect timing He will bring (or not bring) you a man.\nWhen you focus your thoughts on God\u2019s perfect character, it makes trusting in Him a whole lot easier.\nIf you continually keep your eyes focused on the truths of God\u2019s Word, discouragement will have no room to creep in. As long as you are looking to Christ to bring you satisfaction you will be filled with joy.\nThere are loads of girls around the world who do have boyfriends, yet they\u2019re still unhappy. Why? Because they are looking to a guy to make them content. No matter how incredible having a boyfriend may seem, he can never satisfy the deepest longings of your heart.\n\u201cJesus said to them, \u2018I am the bread of life; whoever comes to me shall not hunger, and whoever believes in me shall never thirst\u201d (John 6:35).\nOnly Christ can satisfy your deepest desires.\nI want to challenge you to write down that verse I quoted above (Psalm 84:11) and memorize it. The next time you are struggling to trust in God\u2019s plan for your life recite that verse.\nAsk yourself if you are walking uprightly. That means, are you living a Christ honoring lifestyle? If the answer is no, figure out the sin issue and change it. But if the answer is yes, you can have full confidence that God will not withhold anything good from you.\nThat is anything He thinks would be good; not what you think would be good.\nAfter all He is the perfect, infinite, sovereign and good God. We can undoubtedly trust Him to give us what He knows is best, even in our love life.\nDo you trust that God truly has a plan for your love life?\nAre you tempted to believe the lie that a boyfriend can satisfy the deepest longings of your heart?\nHow can you find satisfaction in Christ alone?\nWrite down Psalm 84:11 and remind yourself of that truth anytime you feel depressed over your current circumstances."

                            "text": "I am constantly amazed at God\u0432\u0402\u2122s handiwork. It seems we are each a thread and are intricately woven together to glorify our Lord Jesus Christ. Often after an event happens or is in the process of happening, we can see the move of God\u0432\u0402\u2122s hand.\nJust recently this has happened to me. It started last year when a dear friend of mine\u0432\u0402\u2122s daughter-in-law was diagnosed with cancer. (I was deeply upset.) My spirit was deeply grieved. She was only 29, and I couldn\u0432\u0402\u2122t understand why this would happen to such a vivacious young woman who had everything ahead of her including starting a family. The cancer took being a birth mother away from her. God laid her heavily on my heart, and as a result I consistently prayed, sent cards, and small gifts to help lighten her day. I knew in my heart that God had something special for this young woman to do, and if I did my part God would see that she lived to do what He called her to do.\nShe faced many hard days. Somehow God made sure that the cards or gifts got to her just when she needed them. Oh I am so grateful to God for taking such good care of her.\nFinally after surgery and chemotherapy had successfully ended, her husband, who stood by her side for many months, threw a party for her. Her friends and family came to celebrate. I was unable to attend due to distance and the struggles we in New Orleans area were facing from the aftermath of Katrina.\nKatrina only a month before had visited our community, homes and schools with great devastation. I an elementary school teacher had great concern for my school and many students without homes and some who now had a lot of homeless relatives living with them.\nOne day during my time of trying to help the students overcome the grief of this disaster, I received an e-mail from a teacher in the community where the young woman who had gone through chemo lived. This teacher while attending my friend\u0432\u0402\u2122s party heard from other friends there about the support, prayers, cards and gifts I had been sending to her. I had in the middle of being out of my home due to the hurricane and not knowing if I would ever be able to return found my comfort in going out and finding cards to send to my young friend.\nThe email to my surprise, shared how she and her school would like to send help to rebuild my school. And send they did. The teacher and her school, vigorously raised money and sent gifts, gift cards, and ordered items from their school catalog to help with rebuilding. These gifts were shared throughout my school. Everyone was in awe of their kindness extended in love to us.\nI have learned through this that no deed, regardless of how small it may seem at the time goes unnoticed by God. He asks each of us to use our gift, and He will take the smallest deed to do a very large task.\nGod\u0432\u0402\u2122s hand as you can see from above intricately wove our lives together for good. I am grateful for \u0432\u0402?The Daily Lily\u0432\u0402\u2122 to enable us to share with our friends in far away places and find new friends that are woven together in the tapestry of life and love.\nThe tapestry! What about the tapestry? Is it pleasing to JESUS? It was torn in sorrows and tied together in LOVE.\nWe are truly blessed to have you in our tapestry. The world is blessed to have you pour out your life to our precious little children in class after class and year after year. I can only imagine how much better off our world will be in the future because of each student that has been touched by you.\nI know Rena because my life has been touched many times by your love, support and prayers to myself, my family, our church and now our new friends on The Daily Lily.\nWe surely value your prayers and assure all that are in this tapestry they personally are being lifted to Our Father because of your love and gift. Thanks!\nRena\u2019s lovely story reminds me of that saying about looking at the back side of a tapestry work. It looks all scrambled and interwoven and unrelated, frayed and mismatched\u2026.but on the front side\u2026.oh! on the front of the tapestry is a grand work of art!\nIn the Old Testament The Lord God taught His people how to SOW seed. And now your seed has been \u201cSowed\u201d and \u201csewn\u201d. What a lovely tapestry. What a magnificent Harvest!\nRena, you are surely living out this teaching and helping others to be woven into this tapestry also!\nWe are not going to miss out on troubles in life, but aren\u2019t we blessed to have people in our life that can encourage, pray, and help us through these difficult times. Job had three friends that came to help and encourage him. (Job 2: 11-13) \u201cThey wanted to go and show their concern for Job.\u201d \u201cThey wanted to comfort him.\u201d What a wonderful teaching: show love, care, and compassion, when those difficult times come.\nThis is such a lovely point to be made. The Lord sees your deeds and helps to connect those people who will be support for one another. The Daily Lily is a tapestry itself, binding together lives that may not have had the chance to connect. Allowing stories of love and faith to inspire those who may not have found inspiration. Thanks for sharing your story Rena; it inspires me. Thanks for the Daily Lily Sara. It always makes me feel warm inside.\nI agree we can see this story multiplied over and over in our lives. I have just seen this story, different names, different faces and places but over the last year another thread in the tapestry has been woven into this work of art.\nThe Holy Spirit is just so amazing how He works in our lives for our good to those that love Him and want Him to connect and weave for us. Such a Master Our Lord is."

                            "text": "One of my favorite moments in the Gospels occurs in John\u2019s account of Jesus\u2019 post-Resurrection encounters. It\u2019s when Mary Magdalene meets the Risen Lord. She finds that Jesus\u2019 body is no longer in the tomb and begins to weep, fearing that someone has stolen His body. As she is crying, Jesus comes to her, though she doesn\u2019t recognize Him right away. He asks her why she is crying and she believes that the man she is talking to is a gardener, so she asks him where Jesus\u2019 body has been put.\nAnd all Jesus has to do to make Mary realize that it\u2019s Him is say her name.\nThough Mary had heard her name called so many times, by so many people, every one of those people probably had a unique way of saying her name that she knew was distinctly their own. Jesus was no different. He held her name in His heart and in His speech with a particular sweetness that no one could replicate. And I can only imagine how much tenderness and love filled His voice as He addressed His dear friend, and how much joy pierced Mary\u2019s heart when she heard that voice that she feared she might never hear again. The voice that forgave her and called her to be His follower. The voice that continued to call her \u201cfriend\u201d and to embrace her with mercy and love whenever she strayed.\nMary knew that voice. Jesus knew that she did, and that He would only have to say so much to bring her peace.\nA few years ago I entered into a period of desolation in my walk with Christ. I couldn\u2019t feel Him anymore when I prayed, when I went to church, when I thought about Him. Everything that I thought I knew about Jesus and my faith had fallen out from under my feet, and I felt unsteady and anxious as I faced the darkness ahead of me. As I began walking through that darkness, I found the band Mumford & Sons. They quickly became my comfort and a source of light and hope in my confusion and hurt.\nI etched those lyrics deep into my heart. Because I knew that line was about me. I had gotten so caught up in my identity as a Catholic before my darkness that when that darkness came, I felt like it was robbing me of my very self. I let it take me away from my faith. In my darkness I waited and waited for something to call me the way Jesus had called me a few years ago. I heard His voice so clearly and so sweetly at a high school retreat, and I kept hearing it for three years. And then, suddenly, silence. I became convinced that the silence meant that I needed to listen for something new, that something else would call me and take the place that Jesus once occupied in my heart. So I kept listening. Nothing really grabbed me. But I knew I would hear it someday. And I would rise again, strong and sure, when I did. Just like the song said.\nI wasn\u2019t sure whose voice I was following when I became a missionary in West Virginia. But as my time as a missionary continued, it became clear to me that Jesus had called me to West Virginia and that He was calling me back to Him. He was the last thing that I expected to hear in my listening, since I had felt so abandoned by Him. But I knew it was Him. I knew because His voice was so lovely, as lovely as it was when I first heard it in high school. I knew because it spoke love and truth and mercy, just as I had remembered from years ago.\nI knew His voice, like Mary Magdalene knew it, because it spoke the peace that I was so desperate for. Just by gently calling my name.\nAren\u2019t we all Mary Magdalene, seeking something that can speak to our deepest longings and put our fears and questions to rest? Something to still our fluttering and wandering hearts, something to fill our emptiness?\nI do know who I am. I know my name because He knows it, too, and He speaks it in a sweet, secret way that no one else does.\nI know it because the way He speaks it gives me life and peace and joy and hope like nothing else can.\nI know it because when He speaks it, it is as if my whole story, my deepest longings, my greatest needs, are contained within that one sweet whisper."

                            "text": "\u201cMake God the utmost delight and pleasure of your life, and he will provide for you what you desire the most.\u201d Psalm 37:4 (TPT) I was reminded of this during a church service recently. Singing a song titled \u201clife\u201d, its lyrics saying \u201cTake my hands, take my breath, take my dreams and I will lift my eyes, lift my faith, lift my voice and worship You\u201d. A declaration of making God the utmost delight and pleasure of your life. A song about pouring out the precious dreams of your heart on the altar and surrendering your life to Him. As we sung those words Holy Spirit showed me another moment from my life, almost decade ago. Standing in that exact spot, making that same declaration in my heart \u2013 handing over my dreams to Jesus. I had been wrestling with Holy Spirit for months. His question was simple: \u201cWhat if that dream in your heart to be a mother is not about you bearing children, what if it\u2019s about being a mother to the generations?\u201d. After months of back and forth, thinking I was okay with this then discovering I really wasn\u2019t, I finally reached a moment of complete surrender. That Friday night, standing behind a generation of young people, that single girl in her mid 20\u2019s poured out the most precious dream of her heart on the altar. For some reason it came as a surprise to me that this was not a moment of brokenness, rather one of launching, of catalyst, as Holy Spirt took what I had poured out and lit that altar up. I was entrusted with our kids ministry, was able to establish SRE (scripture in schools) in schools that had none \u2013 and now we even have chaplains in some of those schools! As well as the children and young people I have been privileged to disciple, walk along side and help them meet Jesus.That moment changed my life forever. My heart is now and will forever be completely for the next generation. My children are not the completion of that desire, they are a chapter in it. As I opened my eyes from this memory, the sight of those young people worshiping Jesus that night morphed through misty tears into the sight of my children dancing with Jesus. The real life manifestation of the deepest dream in my heart. Our God wants to light up your dreams. He wants \u201cHis kingdom come\u201d in your dreams. He was there when you dreamt them and He wants to weave those dreams into your life. He wants His light to shine through your dreams, from the flippant desires of your child heart to the deepest longings drowned in decades of disappointment. You\u2019ve got to pour it out for Him to light it up. The journey will look different to your plan, and the fulfillment might look different to what you expect. We usually forget to account for his exceedingly abundantly above and beyond after all."

She had moved from a mixed school where she felt under-challenged academically to a private girls\u2019 school, but struggled to adapt socially and felt completely isolated; going for weeks without speaking to anyone. GCSEs felt too much and she was having severe panic attacks. She attempted suicide twice and was seen once by CAMHS, but came to OTR while waiting for further CAMHS support. All medication was locked away at home. She felt her issues ran deeper than the \u2018Adaptive Disorder\u2019 that CAMHS diagnosed. She had also recently ended the relationship with her boyfriend, kept secret from her religious parents. She usually only slept for 3-4hrs a night.\nClare was very tearful and said it was the first time she had spoken openly to anyone (including CAMHS) about how she felt. She didn\u2019t like to \u2018be a bother\u2019. They worked on ways she could communicate more openly with her parents about how she felt and what she needed. For example, when alone in the house, her urge to take her own life was sometimes very strong.\nHer parents had not taken this seriously and when her panic attacks became increasingly severe and frequent, she spoke, with her therapist, to her mother about her suicidal thoughts, and her struggles at school. Initially her mother got angry and stressed, but after calming down she supported her to revisit her GP and re-contact CAMHS SPA for an appointment (they had been waiting 4 months).\nShe developed coping strategies for a school trip and other challenging events. This included accessing online support, whatsapping friends, a mindful colouring app, audio books and creating a \u2018notebook\u2019 of drawings and positive support from \u2018herself to herself\u2019, as a reminder. She found all of these very helpful. They discussed how school could support her, and she went into school with her mother to discuss this. CAMHS then prescribed anti-anxiety medication. Each week they worked with the things that worried her. CAMHS then offered CBT, and Clare had to stop coming to OTR, but she knew she could return later if she needed to.\nher panic attacks and suicidal thoughts decreased.\nAlice\u2019s grandfather, who had supported her, had died 4 months previously, followed by her dog. Her father was an alcoholic, and her parents argued constantly, waking her at night. Her relationship with her father was strained due to his anger and lies. Her mother felt very controlling and Alice was under pressure to go to a top university. Home life felt like prison; she could hardly wait to leave but wasn\u2019t sure how she\u2019d survive till then as she felt barely able to cope.\nInitially Alice didn\u2019t want to come to therapy and found it hard to talk. She was detached, unemotional and very angry. Exploring her feelings initially felt new and scary. At home emotions were never expressed or talked about. She began to realise how angry she was with her parents, and began to find the therapy very useful in helping her gain clarity about her life \u2013 she felt supported and safe to talk, and she felt understood, which was a new experience for her and helped her relax and feel more normal.\n\u00b7 coping strategies, discovering which helped and which didn\u2019t."

For every season, there are colors that are most particularly appropriate. After all, we associate certain sights, sounds and moods with each of the four seasons; the same is true of colors.\nSpring: Spring is a time of rebirth and renewal. The colors associated with spring are the gentle pastels of springtime blossoms like yellow and pink. The bright green that symbolizes the vibrancy and vigor of newly sprouted leaves and grasses. And light, pure blue, the color of robins' eggs and skies scoured clean of winter's drab grays.\nSummer: The promise of spring fulfilled. Springtime blossoms yield sugary-sweet fruit in a rainbow's array of colors: golden-yellow pears, glossy-purple plums, ruby-red apples, violet-blue blueberries. And all of nature glows with the emerald-green hue of plants eagerly lapping up the abundant energy of summertime's bright-white sun.\nFall: Like a restful evening's pause after a long and wearying day, fall is a time when nature relaxes in preparation for wintertime slumber. As if dressing for one last celebration of the season of growth, nature garbs herself in a delightful kaleidoscope of colors. Fiery oranges and reds, goldenrod-yellows and russet-browns transform fields and forests into a breathtaking display of nature's splendor.\nWinter: A time of rest and slumber as nature renews herself in anticipation of the coming spring. Crystalline fields of snow sparkle brilliant white in shafts of sunlight angled low across the horizon. Warm white light from rooms kept snug and warm glows cheerily through frosted windowpanes. Icicles dangle delightfully from eaves, glimmering in the sun like frozen streams of molten diamond. And fat white snowflakes glow in the moonlight like otherworldly orbs as they gently fall to earth.\nLED Christmas lights are great for celebrating any time of the year - not just the holiday season.\nThe many different styles of LED lights are also great for customizing seasonal displays. Mini-lights like wide-angle conicals or M5s for symbolizing the colorful breaking buds of springtime. Big and bold C9s for summertime living-large. Plump G12s mimicking fruits and berries ripe for fall harvests. And dangling chains of dainty LED icicle lights for winter.\nThough we call them Christmas lights, that's really a bit of a misnomer. Because for each turn of the season, there's a compliment of LED colors and styles perfectly suited for celebrating that season."

When cigarette smoke gets on your hair, it can quite tricky to get the smell out. If the scent lingers in your hair, you risk transferring the smell to other places you go and leaving it on any other surface your hair touches, such as your pillow, the bed, sofa or your car.\nThe best way to get the smell out is to wash your hair thoroughly. However, if this is not possible because of time constraints or because you don\u2019t have access to a shower, you can try some of these tricks below to get you hair smelling fresher.\nHere\u2019s how to get cigarette smoke out of dry hair.\nMask the smell with another scent. Bring out your body spray and squirt a few spritzes on your hair. Use a light scent so the perfume doesn\u2019t overpower your hair. A light body cologne should do the trick. Try the spray colognes from Bath and Body Works or Victoria\u2019s Secret. However, keep in mind that alcohol based scents may dry out your hair, but you may need to compromise in the interim if you want to get that funky ashtray smell out of your locks. If you have it with you, you can also use Febreze spray or Renuzit on your hair.\nUse Herbal Essences Refreshing Spray. This product works great in removing odors on your hair when you don\u2019t have the time to shampoo. This is readily available at drugstores and the beauty section of Target and other major chains. A bottle costs about $4.\nUse a dryer sheet. Bounce dryer sheets aren\u2019t just for your clothes. These nifty sheets can also help remove the smell of cigarette smoke on your hair. Get a couple of dryer sheets and pass it through your hair strands. This will also keep your hair from getting flyaways since dryer sheets eliminate static electricity.\nUse some dry shampoo. You read right. There are now dry shampoos available commercially that you can use to shampoo your hair without having to rinse with water. Actually, these products have been around since the 1970s but are slowly reemerging the market because of the convenience. Some products worth trying are Frederic Fekkai\u2019s Wash and Wear Spray Shampoo, Oscar Blandi Pronto Dry Shampoo Spray, Klorane Shampoo Dry, TIGI Rockaholic Dirty Secret Dry Shampoo and Algemarin Shampoo Dry Powder Spray.\nAir out your hair. As soon as you get out of the smoke filled place, give your hair a toss to air it out. If possible, you can spritz a bit of water on the hair to help the smell evaporate off your hair strands. After you have let the wind blow your hair to remove the scent, tie your hair up and wear a cap or cover your head with a scarf.\nThese are all temporary measure you can take to remove the smell of cigarette smoke on your hair. As soon as you get home or when you have access to a shower, it\u2019s still best to wash your hair with a nice scented shampoo. Be sure to condition your hair properly. While your hair is damp, avoid exposing yourself to more cigarette smoke and other unpleasant odors. Otherwise, your hair will act like a sponge and absorb everything again."

No not Granddad Pete\u2019s adverse reaction to the Sunday roast, but the comforting aroma that makes you feel \u2018at home\u2019 when you return from holiday or a long period away. Because we are so used to our own \u2018house smell\u2019 we often find that, when visiting someone else\u2019s abode we are taken aback by the strong scent which hits us the moment we walk through the front door, whether it be pleasant or not! Some people go to great lengths to make their home smell \u2018nice\u2019, placing various types of Glade ordourizers thinly disguised as ornamental pebbles about the place.\nWhile this better than having the place stink of rotting food stuff, or even worse, damp dog; an abundance of saccharine sweet smelling fragrances being wafted in your face every two minutes can induce equally unsettling feelings of nausea. So how can you give your pad that distinctive yet subtle sweet aroma while not going over the top and making it smell like The Perfume Shop during the January sales?\nThere are a number of simple procedures you can follow to achieve that fresh, neutral atmosphere, but first of all you must purge any nasty smells. If you smoke in the house, you are fighting a loosing battle, upholstery and thick carpet trap smoke particles meaning that even between cigarettes, visitors will instantly be able to identify you as a chain smoker. Fabreeze can help but the best course of action is simply to smoke outside, not only will this improve the smell inside but it means you guests won\u2019t be forced inhale the toxic fumes.\nAs previously mentioned, the dreaded \u2018damp dog\u2019 syndrome can also lead to a foul stench that you may not necessarily be aware of yourself. This is most common in mutts with long and/or thick hair. Make sure they are bathed regularly and towel dry them immediately. If you are cooking a strong smelling meal like curry, ensure the extractor fan is blowing at full pelt from the outset lest your entire house will smell like a takeaway establishment.\nAnother easy to follow and completely free tip would be leaving windows open for intervals to allow fresh air to circulate and stagnant air to exit. Purchasing a dehumidifier, while not as \u2018free\u2019 is a very effective tactic for banishing pongs as it reduces the amount of moist air which provides a fertile breeding ground for bacteria leading to bad smells. An air purifier could be a more direct approach to banishing pongs, models with carbon filters which capture the air particles carrying the smell in question are considered to be most effective.\nHaving a pleasant smelling house is simple, it just requires a little effort, remember it is more important to get rid of bad smells rather than covering them up with gallons of \u2018jasmine and lotus flower\u2019 air freshener."

                            "text": "A newspaper ad is the desperately needed answer to Kate Whittington\u2019s prayers. Abandoned by her mother\u2014the town tramp, raised in a bleak Maine orphanage, and a spinster without prospects, Kate dreams of a home and family of her own. Unfortunately, when she arrives to begin her new life, the man she believes she married by proxy denies placing the ad. He denies ever corresponding with or marrying her. Worse, he\u2019s a Texas Ranger who\u2019s recently been wounded while rescuing a boy from the Comanche\u2014a boy he believes may be his long lost son.\nReed Benton doesn\u2019t want a wife, doesn\u2019t believe Kate\u2019s story of an ad and letters, but he does need help taming the wild, resentful young boy under his roof\u2014a boy who is a painful reminder of a past filled with betrayal and lies. There is no place in Reed Benton\u2019s heart for a woman.\nCan the faith of one woman with nothing left to lose create a miracle and heal two damaged souls?\nWith her chest and throat burning, racked with chills that shook her thin frame, nine-year-old Katie Whittington huddled in her narrow bed.\nOnly half-awake, at first she thought she had dreamed her mother\u2019s voice, so familiar, tinged with a hard-edged, soulless quality that held no love. But then she heard it again, clearly and for real, and the sound bur\u00adrowed into sleep-fogged corners of her mind, waking her completely.\nThere were the other sounds, too. Throaty moans, whimpers, sharp, keening cries. A man\u2019s harsh, ragged breathing. The whining protest of coiled bedsprings from across the cramped, cluttered room.\nKatie rubbed her eyes and tried to hold back the hollow, jarring cough, but it erupted anyway. She covered her mouth with both hands and listened to the coupling noises, kept her back to the room, and hoped that Mama wouldn\u2019t yell at her again.\nShe lay there pretending to sleep through the noise, painting pretty pictures in her head, dreaming of another life, another world for her and Mama\u2014the kind of world she had only glimpsed from afar, the kind she could barely imagine.\nIn her lovely dream world, she and Mama wore pretty dresses, clean dresses, with starched lace and ruffles, and there were pretty hats to match. The weather was always warm and sunny, and whenever they walked down the street, no one stepped aside or turned away. No one pointed at them or whispered as they strolled along in their pastel finery.\nMama had tried to teach her to ignore the stares and whispers of the townsfolk, but the rudeness still cut Katie to her soul, and it always would.\nShe hugged the torn wool blanket and coughed again, then wiped the palm of her hand on the dirty sheet that was little more than a rag.\nThe linens in her dream home would be soft and clean. There would be a fancy yellow cover on her bed, too, just like one she had seen through the window of a big white house up on Poplar Street. She would have lace curtains, fancy as snowflakes that would never melt, hanging at every window. The sun would stream through them, casting strands of precious yellow gold around her very own room\u2014a room bigger than the shack she lived in now. There would be pretty china plates piled high with more food than any one person could ever eat all by herself.\nThe roof would never leak. The windows would glisten, and there would not be even one single crack in them. Wind would never sneak through holes in the windows or walls.\nShe shivered, her teeth chattering. Without warning, she started coughing again, but this time it went on and on until she lay on her side gasping for air like a dying fish.\nKatie rolled herself into a tight ball, hugging the thin blanket around her shoulders. Her hands were stiff with cold, her feet nearly numb even though she had climbed into bed in her heavy shoes and socks.\nShe tried to picture her pretty dream house and all the lovely dresses again, and the plates piled high with hot food.\nWhen the images would not come, she looked up at the frosted windowpane above her head. Between the ripped curtain and halo of frost crystals, she could see a sliver of moon and one lone star shining in the night sky.\nShe closed her eyes and wished upon that star. She wished all her dreams would come true. Then she opened her eyes, thankful that the moon was not full tonight.\nOn moonless nights it was easier for her to disappear inside herself and shut out the sound of Mama and the men. On moonless nights she was less tempted to watch.\nBut on nights when the moon hung full and heavy in the starless sky, she would silently turn away from the wall, stare through the milk-white light, and watch the shapes writhing on the bed. She would peer over the edge of her blanket and watch as Mama entertained the men who came scratching at the door.\nShe must have fallen asleep, for the next thing she knew, Mama\u2019s hand was on her shoulder, shaking her awake. The room smelled of burning whale oil. The single lamp on the crate beside Mama\u2019s bed cast a weak halo in the corner.\nMama stripped off the blanket and tossed Katie the ugly green wool coat that some little girl across town had outgrown. They had found it in the bottom of the Christmas charity box that the \"self-righteous do-good\u00aders\u201d (as Mama liked to call them) had left sitting on the front stoop last year.\n\"Where? Where do we have to go in the dark? It\u2019s cold out,\u201d Katie whined.\nKatie pulled herself up, climbed off the bed. Mama held Katie\u2019s coat as she shoved the girl\u2019s arms into sleeves that did not cover her wrists. Katie looked around for her faded red scarf, but Mama grabbed her arm before she could find it.\nBefore she could promise not to cough again, Katie doubled over with another spasm.\nHer mother pulled a tattered cotton hankie out of the bodice of her torn gown and handed it to her. Then she grabbed her by the wrist, dragged her across the room, and opened the door. Katie ducked her head to avoid the blustery wind that sailed in off the sea and tried to keep up as her mother tugged her down one cold, deserted street after another.\nKatie knew most of the lanes near the wharf by heart. They had trodden them since she could walk, she and Mama. They lived from hand to mouth on the money that the sailors and fishermen paid Mama when she took them to her bed. When times were very hard, they lived on do-gooder charity.\nAs they passed beneath a street lamp Katie glanced up at the familiar lines and angles of her mama\u2019s thin face. Her mama was looking straight ahead with her jaw set.\nThey were climbing now, up the hill, away from the wharf and the ramshackle houses that lined the narrow byways and shops close to the water. Katie fought for breath as they ascended. The houses up here were larger, prettier, and surrounded by trees, part of a forest that had once grown all the way down to the sea.\nWell into unfamiliar territory now, Mama turned another corner. Barely able to do more than shuffle behind her mother, Katie lifted her head and saw a tall bell tower and the steeple of a brick church. Her eyes tearing from cold, she struggled to read the sign on the front of the building.\nMama was fairly dragging her now, walking faster, more determined.\n\"Ma-ma?\u201d Katie had to gasp for air. She wiped her eyes with the kerchief.\nMama\u2019s huge brown eyes were watering from the cold, too. A fat tear slipped down her bony cheek.\nThe freezing night air, heavy and damp off the sea, burned Katie\u2019s lungs. She had never set foot inside a church before. In awe, she stared at a ghostly white statue of a sad-faced young woman in a niche above the door. Something about the statue made her whisper.\nMama tugged on her arm when Katie kept staring at the statue. Katie sighed when they hurried past the church and the small graveyard beside it.\nExcept for the sound of their hollow footsteps, the neighborhood around them was silent. Not a single lamp was lit inside any of the big houses lining the street.\nSuddenly Mama stopped to open a small iron gate in a low fence bordering the yard of another brick building, one almost as big as the church. The gate clanged shut behind them, ominously loud, with a sound that shattered the silence.\nThe cobblestone walk that led up to the front of the brick building was patched here and there with dirty snow left from the last snowfall. Dead leaves trapped since fall peeked through. Katie lifted her head.\nMama had already started up the six wide steps to the front porch. Katie\u2019s legs gave out after the first three. She knelt on the stair, doubled over, coughing. Mama stood over her.\nMama started beating on the heavy wood door with her fist.\nAbove the door hung a small gold-lettered sign. There was another statue, too. Smaller, but it was the same sad lady who stared down at her with her empty, marble eyes.\nKatie slowly read the words again, faster this time, and frowned. They didn\u2019t know any orphan girls.\nHer mother pounded on the door again, then whirled around and knelt down beside her. She grabbed Katie by the shoulders, leaned so close their noses almost touched.\nMama was whispering frantically now, her raspy voice ragged and hushed. She talked fast, as if her mind were running a race with her tongue.\nPanic squeezed Katie\u2019s heart and lungs. She couldn\u2019t breathe any\u00admore. \"Mama\u2014\u201d She let go of the kerchief and desperately grabbed hold of Mama\u2019s coat sleeves.\n\"You\u2019re scaring me,\u201d Katie wailed.\nKatie stared in horror at the big door and the gold-lettered sign. Inside, someone had lit a lamp. Yellow light bled through plain white curtains. Her heart began to pound in her ears.\nHaving freed herself, Mama stood up; she stepped back as Katie tried to grab hold of the uneven hem of her coat. Mama dragged the cuff of her sleeve across her eyes and then wiped her nose.\nKatie jerked around at the chill whine of the front door\u2019s hinges. An elderly woman wearing eyeglasses and clothed entirely in black stuck her head out, blinking against the icy chill.\n\"Yes? Who\u2019s there?\u201d The woman had a gentle voice, but Katie was still frightened.\nKatie expected her mother to answer, but when she turned around, Mama was already down the cobblestone walk, hurrying through the little iron gate.\n\"Mama!\u201d Katie strangled on the sound, choked on a cough. She struggled to her knees, grabbed the column of the porch rail beside her, clawed her way to her feet.\nThe iron gate clanged with a lonely, hollow, terrible finality. \"Don\u2019t leave me here, Mama! I\u2019ll be good.\u201d Her scream echoed through the empty streets. She was gasping between sobs, fighting the dizziness that clouded her vision.\nAs she wilted toward the cold wooden porch floor where Mama\u2019s torn white hankie lay, Katie felt the old woman\u2019s arms close around her, heard the clack of wooden beads and a hushed prayer whispered beside her ear.\nSaint Perpetua\u2019s School for Orphan Girls.\nKATE AWAKENED, heart pounding, blood racing. She did not move until her pulse settled back into a slow, steady rhythm; then she drew back the sheet and slowly slipped out of bed. Moonlight spilled across her pillow.\nShe had long ago given up trying to sleep when the moon was full. Nights bathed in moonlight held too many memories of the life she had lived with her mother.\nIt was fall again. Maine nights had grown desperately cold already. Kate shivered as she walked through a puddle of milk-white light to the only window in her sparsely furnished attic room. A utilitarian piece of un\u00adbleached muslin hung limp before the pane, as unadorned as everything else in this world of routine and orderliness where she had spent the better part of her life.\nEleven years before, desperately in need of another teacher, the good Sisters of Saint Perpetua had asked her to stay on after graduation. She was given room and board and a small stipend in exchange for teaching history and elocution to girls of all ages.\nAt eighteen, rather than face the streets of Applesby, she had accepted the offer without hesitation, knowing that someday she would have to go out into the world again.\nShe promised herself that one day she would resurrect her old dreams, that she would have that pretty little home of her own and a family to hold dear.\nAs time slipped away and spinsterhood crept upon her, she devoted eleven years to Saint Perpetua\u2019s orphan girls and all the joys and challenges of dealing with them. She had made a home here, one that was safe and warm and familiar. The nuns and the orphans had become her family.\nShe had a certificate of education. She could read and write in Latin. She was a teacher, a scholar.\nA spinster with no living relation.\nThe thought of having to leave after so long filled her heart with dread.\nShe had a little money put by, surely enough on which to survive until she found other employment. She would have to find another place to live\u2014no easy task in a hamlet where her mother had been the town whore.\nShe had nowhere to go, nowhere to turn, and no one to turn to\u2014not even her mother. On Kate\u2019s eleventh birthday, Mother Superior had told her that the old shack near the wharf had burned down, that her mama had died, trapped inside.\nEven in death, Mama had been infamous.\nKate could not go to her mother and tell her that she had forgiven her abandonment, or that she had cried herself to sleep for months, missing her mama more than she would have missed her heart if it had been taken from her.\nNow she looked out the window at the round face of the man in the moon.\nThe moon man smiled back.\nOr perhaps he was laughing at her. She could not tell.\nAT THE END OF October, when the butcher made his final call to the nuns for an accounting, he found Kate standing outside the kitchen door with a hand-me-down satchel in hand. When he asked where she was going and she said that she did not really know, he took pity on her and told her she was welcome to rent the empty room above his shop. He was middle-aged and married, a portly man with fingers thick as the sausages he stuffed, and almost entirely bald.\nWith no alternative in mind, Kate accepted. She rode the butcher\u2019s cart back to the shop, a sturdy whitewashed building near the center of town that was frequented all day long by housewives and maids.\nThe room was adequate and clean, a refuge where Kate spent the better part of the morning scouring up the courage to go out and find employment.\nThat afternoon, the butcher\u2019s wife knocked timidly on the door and told her that she would have to leave on the morrow.\nThat was how Kate learned that Applesby had not forgotten Meg Whittington\u2014that like Mama\u2019s, her name was still as tarnished as an old copper pot.\nShe packed her somber dresses and scant personal belongings again. The next day she held her head high, kept her tears inside, and moved on."

The wafting tang of coffee had tickled her nose as always, pulling her out of an otherwise heavily guarded sleep.\nShe thought about rolling over, greeting him with lazy kisses awash in the hazy glow of sunshine fighting its way through rain cloud. Her mind played with various approaches\u2013how insistent to be when waking him? Trails of kisses? Warm arms and legs intwined with his? A mischevious hand massaging parts unseen? She snickered as the possibilities seemed to her endlessly delicious.\nA frustrated sigh slipped passed her smile. She wasn\u2019t about to do any of that. She wouldn\u2019t give him another opportunity to reject her so openly again. The regular neglect and daily indifference to their intimate life beyond cordial words and a great work relationship was all she could take. At least it didn\u2019t feel intentional. She would not be able to hold it together if he outright rejected her advanced a second time. And God only knew the kind of hateful response that would elicit; he thought of her as emotionally unstable as it was, not recognizing how her instability rests on his moods and unwillingness to love her fully.\nShe wondered if this should be the morning she finally spoke her loneliness out loud, if it were finally time to shatter the fascade of a perfect union with her truth. How would she then say it? Good morning, I am lonely whenever you\u2019re around? Good morning\u2013are you sleeping with someone else? Good morning! Why don\u2019t you touch me anymore? Good morning, I need you to see me. Good morning, I need you to hold me in your arms. Good morning, where is your attention? Because it os never on me, never willingly. Her face hardened with a resolve to say what was killing her inside.\nAnd just as quickly, her resolve dissipated into conflicted desire. She felt him stir, a low mumble escaping sweetly parted lips as he settled on his back from his usual fetal position. Tthe rare moment of his vulnerability decided for her, and she curled herself into the space where she still fit so well: her body resting between his chest and arm, head pressed into His shoulder blade, and arm draped languid across his abdomen. He shifted against the pressure, pulling her closer as he settled back into sleep.\nHer heart twittered. He had not pushed her away or even turned away from her this time. She could feel tears spring into her tightly closed eyes. She willed herself to be present in that moment of validation\u2013of him not turning her away like so many other mornings and too many nights to admit. She lay completely still, afraid to jostle him back into the reality where he barely touched her, rarely made love to her.\nAnd when his hands began to carress her, she swallowed a surprising rush of rage at herself for needing him so much before succombing to the pleasure in his lips against her skin.\nLater, she thought as her face turned to meet his mouth. She would talk to him about it later."

She kept me on the righteous path until Satan called one last time.\nIt was time to take him down or lose my angel forever.\nWatching her place her perfect lips on the side of Logan\u2019s face made me cringe. I know I have no right to feel this way, but those two have something that I can\u2019t quite understand, and I\u2019m jealous. The question is, what do I do about it? As she walks toward me with a huge smile on her face, all my craziness evaporates into the evening sky.\n\u201cAs I\u2019ll ever be,\u201d I reply.\nAfter swinging my leg over my bike, I pass Chauna a helmet, and we put them on together. As she swings her leg over, I hold still and wait for the moment she wraps her arms around me. I take a deep breath as she eases into me and rev the engine to life; all eyes are on us.\n\u201cHold on tight,\u201d I say, and she pulls herself even closer. We take the driveway slow, but when we hit the main road, I pull the throttle and we pick up speed as we make our way toward Sammy\u2019s. As we approach the drive-in, I realize that Chauna is completely right; this place is nothing like it was earlier today. The Sammy\u2019s Drive-In light is lit up like Christmas, and it reminds me of Flo\u2019s Caf\u00e9 in the movie Cars. There\u2019s so much neon, and instead of cars, there are monster trucks everywhere. Pulling the bike in, we park, and I look to Chauna for direction as country music plays in the background.\n\u201cWelcome to Barber. Where the trucks are hot, but the girls are hotter,\u201d she says with pure sexiness. In this moment, I know that this is just the beginning of an epic, new chapter in my life.\nAfter reading the blurb for this book you just don't know what to expect. Young love, adventure and romance are some of what you get. Walker and Chauna couldn't be more different, but they just have this it factor that works. This is a great book for both younger and older audiences alike."

Her long, dark brown hair had been straightened for the occasion and she&apos;d spent extra time perfecting her eyeliner and makeup. Not that any makeup would last long after she got wet, but it was still worth it.\nThis was her graduation ceremony, and possibly the most important moment of her life. In less than an hour, she would be officially an adult and her assignment in the community would be announced. She grinned and flirted with the gathering audience, fluffing her hair and dancing to hide how much she was shaking.\nShe knew what position she wanted. She&apos;d spent most of her life hoping to become the Head Elder&apos;s apprentice. When he retired his position, she would be next in line to take over and guide Katafigo to greatness. She knew how unlikely that assignment was, though. She&apos;d been a horrible student. She&apos;d spent her time goofing off, playing pranks, and procrastinating. Of course she knew the vocabulary by heart, and she&apos;d worked hard to reach the full potential of her talent, but she&apos;d never been good at taking directions. She&apos;d be an awful pick for somebody who was meant to give orders to the entire community.\nBesides, the current Head Elder was her father. If they gave her the position, the accusations of favoritism and nepotism would never end.\nThe wind picked up and Koda scanned the audience again, searching for familiar faces. It was an absolutely gorgeous view. Behind her, the hills were lush with knee-high grasses and fields of purple flowers. In front of her was an inlet where the ocean water had carved into the reddish rock face, creating a deep swimming hole surrounded by craggy cliffs. Over the years, they&apos;d carved steps into the rock, making it an excellent place to address such a large group.\nMost of Koda&apos;s friends were on a lower cliff nearby, standing rather precariously on a small ledge halfway between the top of the cliff and the deep water below. They whistled and shouted luck to her. Koda shimmied her hips and blew kisses in response. God, but they were lucky. They could wear sweaters and jackets to keep away the cold. If this thing didn&apos;t start soon, they might have to call it off before it began. The chill was growing rapidly. Koda didn&apos;t know what she would do if the whole thing were postponed.\nThe smaller kids that had been Koda&apos;s classmates all sat on a sturdier ledge with their feet dangling over the water. Elijah was among them, his ruddy cheeks and big eyes glowing with happiness under his mop of brown hair. Koda would never admit it, but when she went to help the younger ones with their lessons, Elijah was far and away her favorite. Now, he was surrounded by his friends, who jumped around like the monkeys they were. They poked at him and he pushed them back, laughing and goofing around before the pomp and circumstance began for real.\nThe other adults stood at the base of the cliff, right by the water&apos;s edge. It was dizzying to look so far down. Her heart leapt to her throat just at the idea of falling so far.\nTimothy, Koda&apos;s father and head elder, took slow steps to the cliff&apos;s edge. It&apos;s starting, she thought. She scanned the audience again, doing everything she could to keep up the facade of confidence. Koda was meant to be the calm one, the sturdy one, the show-off. She was born to be in front of a crowd. If any of them down below caught on to what she was actually feeling, her reputation would likely be shattered to bits. And then she&apos;d really have no chance at being the Head&apos;s apprentice.\n\"And so it begins,\" her father said over the crowd. Koda jumped from the sound of his voice. It echoed naturally through the ring of cliffs, reaching everyone with no need for amplification. \"A childhood ends, and we prepare to accept a new member into our ranks. Welcome, my dear people. Today we celebrate Koda Riley, Syndesi.\"\nKoda&apos;s heart fluttered at the formal name for her talent. She could see the connections between souls, visible as a tangible thread strung between two hearts. With a single glance, she could understand what things mattered to a person and who they connected most strongly to."

When the door opened and she heard Tay enter, she finished the paragraph she was reading before looking up.\n\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Acra whispered.\n\u201cCousin,\u201d the senior initiate was saying. \u201cHave you heard about the fire--\"\nThe streets of Mournhold were lit by the red glow of the tenement fire, spreading through the tight alleyways by a steady and intense gust of wind. It was as if Dagoth-Ur himself was looming over the city, fanning the flames his heir had struck. A House guard, running toward the blaze, stopped at the sight of Tay, standing uncertainly, swaying, before the front door of Kalkorith's house, a bloodied blade in his hand.\nTay ran for the forest, his cape whipping behind him by the force of the howling wind. The guard clambered after him, sword drawn. He had no need to investigate the house to see the murder. He knew.\nFor hours, Tay raced through the wilderness, the Song pushing him onward. The sound of his pursuer faded away. At last, the trees thinned, and he saw nothing before him but air and water. A cliff, a hundred foot long plunge into the Inner Sea.\nThe Song told him no. It pulled him north, sweetly promising a place to rest among friends. More than friends -- people who would worship him as the heir of Dagoth. As he slowly walked toward the edge of the cliff, the Song became more threatening, warning him not to seek to avoid his fate. There was no escape in death.\nTay spat a curse upon his House and threw himself head first over the cliff.\nIt was another glorious day on the island of Gorne, the first one in weeks that Baynarah could truly enjoy. Uncle Triffith had important company, Housemen from far away, and she had been required to attend every dinner, every meeting, every ceremony. As a child, she remembered, she had hoped for some attention. Now nothing was more blissful than time away from her duties.\nThere was only one thing she wanted to do that she had to do indoors, and that was writing a letter to her cousin. But that could wait until the evening, she told herself. After all, he had not written her in many days. It was the influence of that girl, Acra. Not that she seemed disagreeable, but Baynarah knew how one's first love can be all-consuming. At least, she had read about it.\nAs she walked idly through the wildflower meadow, Baynarah was so distracted with her thoughts that she did not hear her maid Hillima calling. She was quite startled when she turned to see the young servant running up."

The brisk air bites at her nose and cheeks, turning them a rosy pink. The red scarf she wears around her neck pops against her paling skin and dark coat. Her tan, freckled skin and blond hair from Summer is gone, along with the glowing, golden brown hair from Spring. The tips of her hair are already fading into a muddy brown color, for winter is coming. Her breath puffs out through crimson lips, wafting like a cloud of smoke in the cold air. Her shoes click-clack loudly on the cracked pavement, drawing the attention of others. She walks with purpose, shoulders squared and head high. She pops in a sea of people, all in different stages of transformation. Red, orange, yellow and brown hues surround her on all sides. A rush of warm bodies, pumping hearts, and hurried strides. All going different directions, with different destinations in a bustling city. The woman crosses the busy street and enters a park. She walks over to a big colorful tree that looms over her small form. She sits beneath it, back against the trunk. She leans her head back, eyes shutting and takes a deep breath of clean air. Slowly she exhales and opens her eyes, staring up past the quickly thinning leaves to the cloudless blue sky. A gust of wind blows through the tree, and a single leaf drifts down into her open hand. She smiles and blows it gently to the ground, watching as it floats on the wind and lands softly on a tuft of grass. Her eyes glimmer as she looks around at the colors of fall drifting in the wind, and smiles at the beauty of the world."

The cold even percolated her senses. She wanted to jump off the cliff where she was standing.\nShe wanted to feel life as she was falling a long drop.

Wanted.\nWater formed a pool around her lashes.\nThe skies darkened even further. There was an army of clouds gathering about the sky.\nShe felt the first drop on her lips. She licked it. She knew what was about to come. Yet she hardly dared to move a muscle. This was the part she was waiting all along.\nWithin a few seconds in a crescendo the tiny little pearly drops pattered on her.

Shaking out her long golden curls ,Sharon looked around at the interior of the cave.It was warm and dry and obviously lived in.\nShe felt like Goldilocks as she observed the soft pile of mosses and ferns formed into a cozy bed.There were three bowls on a flat rock full of food. One bowl contained nuts,one had berries and one had wild herbs.Sharon put her hand to her mouth to hold back a giggle. Then she decided to give the food a try.Surprised at how hungry she was,she wound up eating everything.Afterward she sat and stroked her companion and watched the deluge.She shivered and yawned.The soft bed seemed to reach out to her and soon she and Raven were curled up together sleeping soundly as the storm raged outside.\nCopyright \u00a9 2008-2019 debi22, celeritas.

Or more precisely Edi has been doing a lot of speaking about trees. Not just speaking. The Tirana mayor's office has been planting trees like crazy all around the city. The latest report I saw said the Bashkia had planted over 8,000 trees along the roads in Tirana as part of the \"Nje qytetar,nje peme\" project. \"One citizen, one tree.\" I hope he reaches that goal. There are few cities on earth that need the healing, cleansing presence of greenery more than Tirana.\nOn a late winter walk the sun sets low at the end of the road and it's hard not to get a little depressed at the bare concrete and skeletal limbs of the trees.\nA few weeks later and what a difference! By the end of May the canopy will stretch across the road keeping the temperatures in the tolerable range.\nThe little trees lining these stretches of street were planted in February and are just starting to green. It will be years before they come close to fulfilling their potential, but it's a wonderful beginning.\nOne day every street in Tirana will be as lush and shade-dappled as this one with an overhead view like the one below.\nFor these things I like Edi. I also like the good folks at Raiffiesen Bank, BKT, Tirana Bank, and many others who are co-sponsoring this effort. They are taking the small steps necessary to lift the quality of life for everyone who lives (and breathes) in Tirana. They may not have been raised on Dr. Seuss like I was, but they must understand the sentiments of the last lines of the \"The Lorax:\"\nwas a small pile of rocks, with one word... \"UNLESS.\"\nI'm glad to see such a wonderful project take shape. I remember talking about a similar idea with the Mayor a few years ago, involving children.

Scores of visitors, from simple sight-seers to intrepid travelers, plan special excursions to view the fall foliage; while enjoying a nostalgic ride through the countryside, nature's admirers can peer eagerly from their windows as their train chugs through hills and valleys gilded with seemingly impossible beauty. As autumn arrives in Canada, forests which were green only days before have now been infused with rich, vibrant colours! It is a phenomenon that never fails to inspire awe in both the wondering visitors experiencing it for the first time, and the fortunate Canadian residents who witness it annually.\nA beautiful gift for someone who loves fall colours! Order yours today!\nThird in our continuing series of coloured and engraved silver coins that celebrate autumn in Canada.\nA stunning work of art by Canadian artist Jacky MacDonald in a poignant tribute to nature's own display of colours.\nA collectible piece of art that skillfully combines the use of colour application with advanced engraving techniques in a remarkable design that integrates the coin's own silver surface for the engraved steam locomotive.\nBeautiful finishing adds dimension and depth to the composition, and brings this vibrant scene to life.\nComes with a graphic beauty box that features the coin design in full colour.\nDesigned by Canadian artist Jacky MacDonald, your coin features a timeless image of autumn in Canada, one that stirs a feeling of wistful nostalgia in its depiction of a beloved, longstanding tradition. Engraved directly into the silver, a classic steam locomotive is seen chugging along the winding, engraved track as a silver cloud of smoke rises up from its chimney. One could almost hear the train whistle echo amidst the tranquility of this forested area, which is ablaze with autumn colours that have been recreated with the use of red, orange and yellow hues of paint. Nature's breathtaking display surely delights the passengers on-board this leisurely fall foliage train ride, as they roll past the maples and birch trees that dominate this Canadian landscape.\nBeautiful coin with wonderful coloring and texture. The designer made all the right decisions for details. I especially enjoy the silver highlights of the train, track and trees on the right. Excellent job!\nIt's well done, I like it with colorful fall and the train.\nI leave it on my kitchen table so everyone can see it. I love trains and I love the fall and I also ordered the bridge.\nPicture does not do this coin justice!\nBeautiful coin! I ordered several for gifts.\nIf you view this coin with a magnifier it will pleasure you.\nThat's a stupid looking coin was my first reaction at the post office. By chance looking at the mint site I see this coin and blow it up. The fall leaves look like an oil painting, the silver tree trunks kept half the coin from looking like an oil painting sticker(should have repeated trunks left) Now when you buy the coin the oil painted and bare silver trees are subtly 3d in perspective. The bare silver steam engine and track give a feel of in-completion yet thatl do boyos.\nIs anyone able to indicate what the first two coins are in this series?"

It might be way too thin, or more figuratively, too bare, like a basic list, outline, or framework that's missing all the important content.\nAdjective: \"a skeletal report,\" \"it's so skeletal.\"\nYou can skeleton something or skeletonize something, meaning you outline it in a bare, meager way--or reduce it to a bare outline. Then it's skeletoned, or skeletonized.\nWhen you call something skeletal, you're comparing it to a bony, skinny skeleton, emphasizing how lacking it is in meat, muscle, content, or substance.\nFor that reason, \"skeletal\" has a negative tone. It's a fun alternative to less picturesque words like \"lean,\" \"scrawny,\" and \"tenuous.\"\nYou might use \"skeletal\" literally and talk about a fashion model's skeletal figure, or the skeletal steel frame of a building under construction.\nBut we'll focus on figurative use. Talk about a skeletal staff running a store overnight, skeletal plans and ideas, skeletal stories and explanations, skeletal outlines and frameworks, skeletal structures and networks, skeletal facts and data (lacking meaningful context or explanation), even skeletal wit and humor (lacking depth, substance, or elaboration).\nI enjoyed its flamboyant musical numbers; it didn't seem necessary to follow Mamma Mia!'s skeletal plot.\n\"The lyrics to 'Factory Girl' are spare and skeletal, deploying the same three-line-stanza structure as a traditional blues.\"\nExplain the meaning of \"skeletal\" without saying \"bony\" or \"outlined only.\"\nFill in the blanks: \"It took (someone) (a certain amount of time) just to assemble a skeletal outline for the (paper, speech, proposal, presentation, etc.).\"\nExample: \"Science wasn't my subject.

                            "text": "That same Monday after lunch, Emily rode out Avon Street to Community Bikes on the south side of Charlottesville. She took her Bianchi Volpe and wore her touring bicycle kit.\n\u201cHey, Tani, what\u2019s up?\u201d she said to the wrench helping a ten-year old boy change a tire.\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK\u201d said Taniqua. The boy finished sliding the tire back on the rim and looked up.\nTaniqua pointed to the floor pump, and he went to fill his tire.\n\u201cWhen do you get off?\u201d Emily asked.\n\u201cI finished already, but I missed lunch. Let me grab it and we can chat somewhere while I eat.\u201d She said a few words to the manager and pulled a brown paper bag out of the refrigerator. She zipped it into the rack trunk on her Bianchi Volpe and the two friends rode to the Downtown Mall.\nSitting on a bench, they caught up on their summer adventures while the tourists walked past them. The two green Bianchi\u2019s caught a little attention, and the teenage boys ogled them and tried to look cool. Emily enjoyed being able to sit with her friend and not be recognized.\n\u201cI still wish I could race,\u201d said Taniqua as she crumpled the wax paper from her sandwich into her bag and took out a banana. She offered it to Emily, who shook her head.\nEmily and Taniqua sat silently for a while. Taniqua slowly eating her banana, and Emily thinking deeply.\nThey rode out US-250 west, past Crozet and took the Transamerica Bike Trail back, looping North to Rio Road and the bike lanes that cut the town in half from north to south. They rode as fast as Emily normally did during the summer touring, which was a challenge for Taniqua.\nMrs. Jackson was walking from the bus stop when they pulled up in front of Taniqua\u2019s house.\nLouisa Jackson\u2019s expression darkened, and she looked at Emily with a stern expression.\nLouisa Jackson motioned the two of them into the house. They locked their bikes together outside and went in. Mrs. Jackson put her purse and her shopping on the kitchen counter and took a half-gallon of orange juice from the refrigerator. Both girls nodded to her inquiring look.\nLouisa Jackson looked at the two of them, then smiled at her daughter. \u201cI guess it\u2019s OK. Just don\u2019t be going off having adventures like this one did this summer!\u201d She cocked her head at Emily. Taniqua nodded vigorously.\nEmily took her leave and rode home in time to beat her mother back from the PhD seminar she was meeting with. Mark returned just before supper.\nThe next two weeks were filled with activity. Training three times a week, alone and with the UVA team, riding with Taniqua, shopping for school, and orientation meetings on Grounds. She had asked for and been assigned a traditional dorm room on McCormick Road. She approached Move-in Day like another tour, packing her panniers, and a messenger bag for her computer.\nThe weekend after Jack visited NGIC, Hilda and he rode out to the Dempsey\u2019s for a backyard barbecue. Jack had decided to accept Col. Richardson\u2019s offer, so with Hilda starting work the Monday after Move-in day, this was the last gathering of the summer for the five friends. They enjoyed each other\u2019s company until almost midnight, when Jack and Hilda rode back to her flat. They enjoyed the night air, cool and fresh after the heat of the day, and clean with almost no traffic.\nMonday morning, Jack took the Northeast Regional to Aberdeen to gather his uniforms and other possessions. Not that there was much. Monday afternoon he called on Nate Harper and Ted Turner, because orders transferring him to NGIC had been issued on Friday. It only took an hour for the checkout procedure. He spent the night with Joe and Linda.\n\u201cIf Kathleen Richardson likes you, the job won\u2019t stay temporary, bro.\u201d Joe winked.\nJoe pulled his truck into the parking lot of the train station. Jack pulled his duffel bag out of the truck bed and walked to the platform with his brother. Side-by-side, the resemblance was striking. Both men were aging well, so that the difference in their ages grew less each year. The train arrived on time. With a hug and a promise to keep in touch, Jack was on his way to the next chapter in his life.\nUVA Move-in Day the following weekend was an adventure in its own right. SUV\u2019s and cars with trailers were lining up for their time slots as Katherine and Emily rode down McCormick Road and locked their bikes outside Lefevre House on Hancock Drive. A hot summer sun had been beating on the asphalt and the humans for hours, and it was almost at its zenith.\nAll around them, students were running with their arms full. Parents were crying and shouting, and tempers were flaring as parents tried to move their children\u2019s belongings to the sidewalk and then up to the rooms. Emily unsnapped her panniers and hugged her mother.\nEmily headed into the open door but stopped and slipped back out to watch her mother ride up Hancock Drive towards McCormick Road. Katherine\u2019s hand was wiping her eyes as she pedalled to her office.\nUp on the second floor, Emily found her room halfway down the hall. She pushed the door open and found that she was the first to arrive. She went to the window and opened it. The window faced west and looked over the Cemetery, a park-like foreground to Lewis Mountain. The fresh air from the trees quickly displaced the hot stuffiness in the room. She picked the bed and desk on the south wall, which stayed in shade all day. Putting her messenger bag on the desk, she unloaded her panniers into the closet and made her bed. She was standing at the mirror next to the desk wondering if she wanted to rent a micro-fridge when the door flew open with a crash.\n\u201cWhich bed is Cindy\u2019s?\u201d shouted a walking mountain of suitcases topped by a purple backpack. Emily whirled around and leapt backwards on to her bed while the pile teetered toward the window. She pointed across the room.\n\u201cThanks.\u201d The large man in a red shirt and jeans turned right just in time to drop his load on the bed. His voice matched his burly appearance, bass and loud.\nEmily eased off the bed as he stood up and turned around.\n\u201cHi. Be right back!\u201d He ran to the door, yanked it open and almost knocked over a slender woman about his shoulder height, carrying three totes and another backpack. He mumbled an apology and ran down the hall. The woman stepped inside. Behind her came a shy-looking girl with wide, blue eyes, and blond hair in a ponytail. She looked around the room with a mix of fear and dismay. When her gaze settled on Emily, she smiled weakly, and put down the two totes she was carrying.\n\u201cHi. Emily Hampstead.\u201d Emily held her hand out. Cindy shook it while her mother dumped her load on the bed. Cindy\u2019s grip was firm, which surprised Emily. Cindy was about Emily\u2019s height, but thinner. Her expression shifted from awe to pleasure, and her smile widened and went up to her eyes. Sandra turned around and shook hands, too. She had dyed blond hair cut shoulder length, and tanned, leathery skin. Emily recognized the wrinkles around her mouth as something smokers get, so Sandra could have been any age old enough to have Cindy.\n\u201cNeed some help?\u201d asked Emily.\n\u201cI think we only have one more run. My husband is getting the micro-fridge and the last suitcase.\u201d She waved at Cindy, who hurried to open suitcases and empty them on the bed. She had a massive pile of clothing and other belongings on the bed by the time her father pushed his back through the door with a micro-fridge and another suitcase on a dolly.\n\u201cI was just wondering whether to rent one of those,\u201d Emily offered, as he swung it into place. Cindy took the suitcase and emptied it on the pile on the bed.\n\u201cNo need. It served her brother just fine.\u201d He extended his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Alden.\u201d His hands were rough with callouses, and his grip stopped just short of crushing her hand. He turned to the others. \u201cGotta move the truck. Let\u2019s get those suitcases out of here.\u201d The family vanished as suddenly as they had appeared, leaving behind a single medium suitcase teetering atop the pile. Emily went to the window and leaned out in time to see them come out the front door. Alden had four empty suitcases on the dolly, and the women had one in each hand. They walked across the street to a four-door, king-cab pickup truck and heaved their loads into the bed. Cindy hugged her parents, then waved from the sidewalk as they got in the truck and drove away.\nEmily looked around the room. The micro-fridge was covered with decals from Virginia Tech and organizations that she did not recognize. The pile on the bed included wear for every occasion, including two long evening gowns, suits, a fan, a large, professional hair dryer, jeans and tee-shirts in every colour possible. Emily wondered if Cindy would have to do laundry before Thanksgiving if she changed every day.\nShe took her plastic water glass from the shelf in her closet and filled it from the sink. She had just finished drinking and putting glass on the left side of the sink, when Cindy pushed through the door. She had her cell phone to her ear.\n\u201cYes, Mom\u2026 Don\u2019t worry. Yes, Mom. Bye, I love you, too.\u201d She tapped the phone and rolled her eyes as she threw the phone on the desk. She looked at Emily. \u201cThey\u2019re still in traffic getting to I-64.\u201d She sat down on the desk chair with a sigh.\n\u201cShe overloaded my brother Matt when he went to Tech. I\u2019ll be bringing stuff home on every trip until I graduate!\u201d That made Emily laugh.\nTogether, they had Cindy\u2019s closet crammed full in just a few minutes. It took a while to sort out the things she would use to put in the drawers. What was left, she put in the suitcase. \u201cFirst run home,\u201d she said, patting the suitcase and leaning it on the wall near her desk. The desk was full of items, but the bed was clear. The medicine cabinet and Cindy\u2019s half of the sink were full.\nCindy\u2019s mother called twice while they were organizing their respective desks. Emily avoided commenting. She guessed that Cindy was the last child to leave the nest. By 12:30, they were more or less moved in.\n\u201cWe have a half-hour before the President\u2019s Address. Want to grab something to eat on the way?\u201d Emily asked.\nThey laughed, grabbed their phones and wallets, and locked the door behind them. In the hall, they joined the flow of students with the same idea, dodging the families still coming upstairs to move in. The noise level reminded Emily of the hallways in high school between classes, except for the deeper voices of the fathers.\nThey picked up sandwiches at Newcomb Hall, which they finished on the way to Old Cabell Hall. The two roommates briefed each other on their backgrounds. Cindy\u2019s parents settled in Virginia Beach when her father retired from the Navy. Matt was about three. Alden was courted by the defense contractors for his skills, but he liked working with his hands. He became a custom builder and handyman, and his business was booming when Cindy came along.\nCindy\u2019s wide-eyed excitement about Emily\u2019s having lived in different places made Emily a little uncomfortable, if only because she had never felt that way. She was surprised that the Matthews family had never vacationed abroad, but considering that a builder\u2019s busiest and most profitable season is the summer, it made sense that Sandra and Cindy would take small trips rather than extended holidays. As they settled into seats in the auditorium, she noticed a student in the row in front of them with an \u201cI registered\u201d sticker on her shirt. Emily had registered to vote before leaving in the spring.\n\u201cCool! \u2013 \u201d Applause cut off whatever she was saying. The Provost, the President and a half-dozen other officials walked onto the stage. The students settled down to listen to the speeches. Emily had met the new President at a reception for the Faculty and their families shortly after she returned to Charlottesville. There had been speeches there, too. The Provost was also new. Both officials made much of their newness held in common with the First-Year students (not \u201cFreshmen\u201d as in other schools).\nEmily looked around. Some of her classmates looked bored, some mildly interested. Many, like Cindy, looked at the stage as if in rapture. Whether the speech or the reproduction of Raphael\u2019s School of Athens behind the stage attracted their interest, she could not tell.\nAfter the speeches, the two walked to the SAC.\nThis entry was posted in bicycling, Emily & Hilda, Fiction and tagged Charlottesville, Cindy, Emily, Katherine, Mark, Taniqua, UVA by JT Hine.

Once all the students had taken their seats, Lillian stood again and walked to the front of her desk. \"Have any of you heard of 'the boy who lived'?\" Many hands went up and she continued. \"Who can tell me the name of this person?\" She looked around, and then called on a student sitting in the front row. \"Yes?\" The student put their hand down. \"Harry Potter is his name, Professor.\"\n\"Very good. For those of you who are not familiar with the name, he was a boy who attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry; not this branch, but the original,\" she said. \"Later in life he was an auror. But most know him as the one who defeated Voldemort, the most powerful and dangerous dark wizard of our age. Now, I am going to release class early today.\" Several students began talking excitedly to each other. \"Don't get too excited, I'm letting you use this time as independent study and you still have homework.\" Several groans followed that announcement. \"I expect you to read up on Harry Potter,\" Lillian announced; she wasn't going to lecture about him, as any student with a wizarding background would know the story, but they should know it in more detail, and Muggleborns should be aware. \"For homework, write an essay about the school of Hogwarts, the history of it, or any famous person you can find out about who was associated with the school. Class dismissed.\" Lillian had given a very broad essay topic, and was looking forward to see how the students would handle finding information for themselves.\nSamantha walked into her class and sat in her usual spot which was at the front of the classroom. She began putting all the notes and anything else she needed onto her desk while waiting for the other students to arrive. Once everyone arrived, the professor began with the class.\nWhen the professor mentioned about the boy who lived, she instantly raised her hand up. She remembered her dad mention about him. He did so many great things, she remembered her father tell her. The professor then asked what was the name of the boy who lived. Samantha still had her hand raised. The professor picked her to answer the question. Samantha put her hand down slowly and said, \"Harry Potter is his name, professor\" The professor continues on with the lesson and explains more about Harry Potter, she took down some notes about what she says. The professor also mentions that the class would be dismissed early. Samantha heard murmurs of excitement from her classmates around her. Once class was dismissed, Samantha packed her things and left the classroom, getting straight into her History Of Magic homework.\nAmy entered the History of Magic classroom, hoping that today's class would be interesting. It wasn't her favourite subject and had found that she wasn't studying it as much as she should've been. She took a seat and pulled out her notes. The class began and Amy was relieved to find out they were learning about Harry Potter. She knew a little bit about him, but knew that there was probably a lot she didn't know. The class ended quite quickly, so she hurried out to begin the essay. Maybe she would start enjoying her History of Magic classes more, now that she had settled down a little more at the school."

She was drawn to the large windows that took up one wall of her apartment, the landscape of D.C. laid out before her in a radiance it lacked during the day.\nA knock pulled Emily from the view, and she glanced at the clock as she made her way to answer the sound. Her movements became rushed when she checked to see who was on the other side of the door, golden hair and blue eyes making her hands clumsy.\n\"Jennifer,\" she said on a breath as the metal and wood finally opened to fully reveal the team's communications liaison.\nA shy smile was her greeting, and Emily watched in rapt fascination as a strand of platinum-infused hair fell forward across a honeyed cheekbone. When J.J. pushed it back into place, Emily realized she was staring.\nCome in,\" she said, taking a step back to allow J.J. to enter. She shut the door behind her and turned to face the woman who was waiting patiently in her hallway.\n\"I was on my way home and wanted to check on you,\" J.J. said. \"I don't think you should be alone.\"\nEmily's smile was genuine and met with one of J.J.'s own. \"I'm okay. I don't have a concussion.\" She motioned toward the living room. \"But, do you have time for a drink?\"\n\"I'd like that,\" J.J. said.\nJ.J. ventured further into the room, her focus on the scene Emily had been studying only moments prior to her arrival.\n\"I always forget how beautiful it is,\" J.J. said. \"I just keep thinking how darkness covers a multitude of sins.\"\nEmily watched her from the kitchen, her attention caught by the figure illuminated by the faraway lights of the capitol building. Two wine glasses and a bottle of red in her hands, she approached J.J. slowly.\n\"You know as well as I do just as much can happen in the daylight.\"\nJ.J.'s smile was brief, but she joined Emily on the couch without an argument.\n\"Are you sure you can have that?\" she asked instead as Emily poured the wine.\nEmily shrugged. \"I didn't take the meds, just a couple of Tylenol.\"\n\"It's down to a dull ache now. I've had worse.\"\nJ.J. smirked. \"I don't believe you, but I'll let it go for now. We have other things to discuss.\"\nEmily sighed and placed her glass on the low table in front of her. \"Yeah.\"\nJ.J. took another sip of her wine and seemed content to wait for Emily to start their conversation. Emily glanced at her after a long few moments of silence, but J.J. just looked at her with a steady gaze. Emily had to turn away.\nLeaning forward, Emily put her elbows on her knees with her eyes on the floor. \"How much do you know?\" she finally asked.\n\"That you resigned in order to protect the team, especially Hotch, from Strauss. That you were just going to leave without a word to anyone. That you swore Garcia to silence and wouldn't allow her to even tell me she spoke to you.\" She saw J.J.'s glass join hers on the table and heard J.J. lean back into the couch. \"That you were going to walk away from me.\"\n\" She shook her head but then turned her attention back to the rug decorating her floor. Taking a deep breath, she exhaled deliberately. \"I'm sorry. I didn't know what else to do.\"\n\"Trusting your team would have been a good start.\"\nEmily's shoulders slumped. \"Yeah,\" she said, standing and making her way to her kitchen.\nJ.J. watched her walk away, following her every move as Emily opened one cabinet to grab a crystal tumbler and then another to pull out a bottle of vodka.\n\"Don't,\" J.J. said as she stood.\nEmily froze, the bottle in her hand forgotten as J.J. approached.\n\"Have you listened to your voicemail?\" J.J. asked. Emily shook her head.\n\"I knew you were just trying to find me.\"\nJ.J. stepped around the island separating her from the other agent and took the bottle from Emily, placing it on the counter and putting on its lid.\n\"You scared me,\" she said to the granite countertop.\nEmily hesitated, her hands wrestling each other to prevent them from reaching out to the younger woman. Finally, her words came out in a rush.\nI told Hotch that Garcia had tried to talk me out of resigning and that if she couldn't no one could, but the truth is I knew you could. I didn't know what else to do. I had to protect you, all of you, and I didn't want you involved with what was happening.\"\nAgain, silence settled over them until J.J. nodded and met Emily's eyes. \"Promise me you'll let that be my choice next time.\"\nEmily stared into the serious gaze in front of her. \"I promise.\"\n\"Good,\" J.J. said and then leaned forward to press her lips to Emily's.\nThe older woman was momentarily surprised but didn't hesitate as she returned the kiss with vigor, drawing J.J. closer and deepening it with an intensity that should have alarmed her. When they parted, Emily couldn't stop a goofy grin from forming.\n\"I've wanted to do that for months,\" she said.\n\"What took you so long?\" J.J. asked.\nEmily shrugged. \"Fear. I'm not exactly suave when it comes to matters of the heart.\"\n\"I've noticed,\" J.J. said. \"But, you've been flirting with me since you joined the team. I've been waiting for you to make a move.\"\n\"You just decided to make it for me?\"\n\"Someone had to do something.\"\nEmily pushed a strand of J.J.'s hair behind her ear, her hand coming to rest on J.J.'s neck.\n\"I think you should stay here tonight,\" Emily said. \"You know, to keep an eye on me.\"\nJ.J. laughed. \"You said you didn't have a concussion.\"\n\"Well, better safe than sorry,\" Emily teased, her fingers intertwining with J.J.'s and tugging the younger woman closer.\n\"I have a feeling, Emily Prentiss, that security is not your number one priority.\"\nEmily leaned forward to gently touch her lips to J.J.'s, a kiss so soft all J.J. could do was sigh as it ended.\n\"You're very perceptive, Agent Jareau.\"\n\"Yeah, well,\" J.J. said as she followed Emily up the stairs, their hands still locked. \"That's why there's an 'I' in F.B.I.\"\nEmily's laugh echoed off the walls, breaking the silence from the city outside the window."

Because it's a rather unusual joining of two very different shows I wouldn't mind feedback, even if it's just to tell me I need to be committed- it wouldn't be the first time! Thanks for reading.\nSPOILERS: Up to S2 for The 4400, round about S1 for The Gilmore Girls.\nIt wasn't real. It wasn't. Any moment she was going to wake up and this would all be a nightmare. She'd wake up and it'd be the morning again. And the day would not be anything close to horrific. There would be no suicide attempts, no accidents, no ambulances. Trying to keep as calm as humanly possible was her effort for Rory and Maia's sakes but it wasn't working internally. Inside her head rested the image of a limp Lorelai as the firemen had gingerly raised the hefty telephone pole from her back and the expression on the paramedic's face when he'd taken a look at the damage. Now the doctors were taking their own looks but Diana didn't need a psychic to tell her it was all far from good.\nDiana blinked a tear down her cheek.\n'Can I speak to you in private for a moment?' he asked, beckoning her into a room off to the side of the sterile corridor.\n'I can't lose her,' she admitted, her voice trembling.\n'Are you a family member?' he queried.\nReturning to Rory and Maia she explained the situation as succinctly as possible. Rory, to her credit, was coping remarkably well. Diana guessed that, having spent years thinking her mother was dead, as bad as this was it couldn't be any worse than that. Maia turned her head away, presumably so she couldn't be seen crying and Diana thought it best not to approach her at the moment. Instead, she sat down next to Rory.\n'You look ill,' Rory persisted.\nThere was a lengthy silence. After a couple of minutes Diana moved to sit next to Maia and was satisfied by the fact that her daughter collapsed into her arms. A little time later Richard Gilmore rushed into the hospital. 'Agent Skouris?' he said, his voice less than level.\nold combined with a new one. She stood and briefly explained again what the doctor had said, almost stumbling over the segment about paralysis.\n'I'm okay,' her daughter said quietly.\n'Mom?' Maia said, glancing up to her.\n'You'll be the first,' she promised, watching them vanish around a corner. Then she fell into a stiff chair and buried her head in her hands.\nThis was too much like a nightmare. She couldn't comprehend it. All she could think of was the moment when Lorelai had pushed her out of the way: it was replaying repeatedly in her head. She thought there was something she should've done differently, shouted to Lorelai to stay back perhaps. And now she'd be the one unconscious, wouldn't she?\nIt had to be done. Emily had done some horrible things in her recent past but it was still her daughter unconscious and possibly paralysed. The end of days made you do strange things. When she herself had thought the world might be coming to an end she'd called her father, after all.\nAfter a couple of minutes of worrying what was going on in the room she decided to go in and check. Gingerly popping her head around the open door, she found Emily tearfully holding Lorelai's limp hand and mumbling quietly to herself. Diana didn't want to intrude, but she didn't particularly care to leave either, so she stood there with her arms crossed watching the tableau from afar.\n'In case she dies,' Rory concluded for her bitterly.\nShe just shook her head and let Emily leave in silence. Then she let out her breath and checked her watch. It was after eight already. Diana couldn't believe she'd gotten through the day without screaming once. Having kept her composure for Rory and Maia's sakes she now found the mask slipping. Going back into the room where Lorelai lay, she dropped down heavily into the plastic chair beside the bed and reached for the returnee's hand.\n'No!' The voice was hoarse and the returnee immediately tried to clear her throat. Glancing to the bedside table, Diana reluctantly poured water from a plastic container into a plastic glass and helped Lorelai swallow a little. 'Thanks,' she murmured in a clearer tone.\n'Rory needs you, Lorelai,' Diana said softly.\n'You're my daughter, Lorelai,' Emily answered simply.\n'Don't tell her,' Lorelai mouthed as Diana reluctantly gave up her seat to Rory. Stepping back, she watched mother and daughter embrace and saw the tears running down Lorelai's face- half of them were from fear, she knew.\n'Oh, kid, nothing could,' she answered, pulling her daughter into another crushing hug. Then she squeezed her eyes shut tight.\nWith obvious hesitation, Rory backed away then turned and walked straight past her grandmother without a word. Emily didn't acknowledge that fact. Instead, her eyes rested on her daughter for a long moment before she also turned and vacated the room. Diana lingered still longer, until Lorelai pressed her lips tightly together and nodded.\nShe arrived back in the waiting area to witness the converging of Emily and Richard. Neither spoke: they just averted their gazes and took seats chairs apart. Rory, her eyes glazy and hard, sat on the left flank of her grandfather; which was inevitably the side furthest away from Emily. To Diana's enormous surprise, however, Maia- who had been watching the scene from a little way down the corridor- took the seat closest to Emily and put her hand over Mrs Gilmore's tightly clasped ones. Emily started, obviously shocked by the gesture, but then she accepted it with good grace and bit down on her lip to, Diana guessed, control her raging emotions.\nDiana had to hold it all in herself. She had no justification for expressing the amount of anguish she felt inside so she had to keep a lid on it. That was easier said than done, she realised, as two more faces ploughed into the waiting room.\n'How is she? Is she okay?' Luke questioned immediately.\n' Sookie trailed off as a couple of tears trickled down her cheeks and she unconsciously placed a hand on her swelling stomach.\n'And?' Luke's fists were clenched tightly.\n'Sit,' the teen repeated firmly.\nGlancing up, Diana found Luke's eyes on her. He understood, she recognised, and when he motioned with a nod for her to follow him she did so without hesitation.\n'I think she's changed,' said Diana softly.\nFour words stuck in her head- short of a miracle. 'I have to go,' she murmured absently, pushing out of the door despite his remonstrations. Reaching the gathered congregation she looked to Maia, still by Emily's side. 'You understand?' she mouthed.\n'I have to go someplace, Rory,' she said steadfastly, fixing her gaze on the automatic doors a few yards ahead.\n'I've got to,' she replied firmly, sidestepping.\n' The anger faded into silent convulsions while Emily gazed at her granddaughter with her own anguish visible.\n'I need your help, Shawn,' she admitted.\n'Why do you care so much, huh?' he said eventually.\nDiana knew she couldn't return to the hospital. She couldn't face Rory until she had some sort of concrete reason for apparently running away like she had. Once Shawn arrived she could walk in there with a resolution. She was just praying for that moment to come. Maia, she knew, would be safer at the hospital than anywhere else. Diana didn't think she could be trusted to look after her own daughter at this point. She felt too unsteady on her own feet.\nDamn right they had. Lorelai was lying unconscious, possibly dying, and it was down to her. No matter how she tried to talk herself round the truth of the matter was that Lorelai wouldn't be fighting for her life if Diana hadn't interfered in it.\nShivering involuntarily she glanced around at the family photographs, the warm environment Lorelai had so seamlessly recreated for herself and her daughter. Suddenly she felt extremely sick. Looking around for her cell phone that she'd dropped somewhere after her conversation with Shawn she grasped at it and dialled with shaking hands.\n'Hey, Tom,' she breathed, relieved to hear a familiar voice.\n'I was gonna call but I thought your cell would be off,' he said.\n'You've heard then?' she sighed, recognising his tone. It was the one that edged into conversation whenever there was a new problem with the 4400. She always detested it.\n'You were there then?' Tom asked.\nShe knew why he was asking- he was concerned for an impressionable young girl- but the guilt she felt for Maia having dealt with a premonition of her mother's death stung at her sharply. 'No,' she finally muttered uncertainly.\n'It's touch and go,' she said as evenly as she could.\n'You weren't forthcoming about Shawn,' she reminded him.\nShawn had been miraculously rapid. Just as Diana had decided she couldn't justifiably stay away from the hospital any longer he'd steamed in on a private jet. Now she was striding into the hospital with the solution next to her she felt confident.\nThat was until she walked in on the picturesque family tableau in the waiting room. Maia was asleep on Luke's knee with her legs poking at his ribs. The diner owner himself was awake- that was obvious enough from the grimace on his face- but his eyes were shut. Beside them sat Emily then Sookie then came Richard and Rory and next to her, with an arm wrapped tightly around her shoulders, was a man Diana recognised from photos as Christopher Hayden.\n'Yep,' she lied, her stomach somersaulting. Regaining her balance somewhat she continued walking forward.\nEmily was the first to note their presence. 'Agent Skouris?' she murmured, drawing herself swiftly to her feet and striding over, though her walk betrayed her exhaustion. Her announcement alerted the rest of the group who all gazed at her; some expectantly, some quite angrily.\nMaia, waking up at the shrill tone, slid off Luke's lap and ran over. Diana gratefully received her daughter in her arms. 'Are you okay?' she whispered.\n'And who is this boy?' Richard added.\n'Who is this young man?' Emily questioned, in a voice much softer than her estranged husband's.\n'Is this true?' Richard demanded.\n'Is it?' Sookie echoed hopefully.\n'Yes,' Shawn said, appearing under pressure.\n'Can you help her?' Emily asked.\nRichard glanced to his wife, half-reached for her then dropped his arm back down to his side. 'Can you?' he repeated.\nThe returnee nodded and pressed through the nearest doors with Luke ahead of him. Feeling a sense of uncontrolled relief Diana watched them disappear out of sight then her stomach tightened as she realised that turning around would mean coming face to face with Christopher Hayden. With that thought in mind she didn't turn back to the group, she simply ploughed on after Shawn and Luke.\nLuke had accosted a doctor and was keeping him busy while Shawn slipped unnoticed into Lorelai's room. While Diana watched he pressed his hands down onto her chest and she lurched up, almost like Collier had just before he died. Mindful of the fact Shawn hadn't been able to save him; Diana's fists clenched tightly.\nSuddenly Lorelai's eyes broke open and Shawn let her drop back onto the hospital bed. He took her hand as she struggled into an upright position. Diana waited for some kind of sign that Lorelai's back had been irreparable, but none was forthcoming. After first looking confused Lorelai then frowned then seemed panicked and looked around. Diana met her eye though the plastic of the door and felt a lump in her throat.\nBefore she could do anything, though, Rory and Richard had steamrollered past her.\n'Mom?' Rory's voice broke as she jumped on her mother.\nDiana blinked away the tears that were threatening to fall and turned to locate Maia. Behind her she heard the doctor Luke had cornered shouting at the influx of people into his patient's room. She didn't wait for the miracle to be uncovered.\n'Everything okay?' Maia asked quietly.\n'I wanted to be here,' objected Maia with a shrug.\nMaia didn't reply, something which Diana was grateful for. She didn't want to explain the emotions currently raging inside of her; particularly not to a child. However mature Maia seemed at times she was just that- a child. She'd already dealt with so much, it was beyond cruel to give her anything else that could be avoided.\nAnd that, Diana told herself icily, was a sentiment it would've been worth remembering a couple of months ago.\nThe rest of the waiting area was empty. As far as Diana knew only Rory and Richard were actually accounted for; they were in with Lorelai. Then again, she hadn't been attentively watching where anybody was going when she'd stumbled back out into the corridor. That meant, she realised with a jealous lurch of her stomach that Christopher could be in there as well.\nMaia cuddled into her side, drawing her mind away from Rory's father. Her daughter hadn't slept or eaten properly in over a day: she was the important one now. She was about to vocalise the thought that they return to Stars Hollow and rest when Emily Gilmore appeared from the general direction of her daughter's room.\n'Can I speak to you, Diana?' she questioned politely.\nAfter Maia nodded Diana stood and followed Emily around two corners into a quiet secluded corridor of the hospital. It was the way which led to the morgue, she recognised, and wrapped her arms around herself as the implication of that thought sank in. They'd been so close to that in reality, and that reality scared her.\n'I know,' Diana replied softly, allowing herself a small smile.\n'I'm not disputing that,' answered Diana, wondering where this was going.\n'Do you know what is best for Rory then?' Emily queried.\n'Well, for her mother to be out of hospital for a start. What else would you suggest?' she added, though she almost felt where this was going.\n'She wasn't before,' Diana reminded her.\n'I just mean that you've obviously informed her of your special relationship with her mother,' Emily answered innocently.\nShe needed to get away from this. Not stopping to listen to anymore rubbish from the woman she'd spent the last few days defending to her family, Diana returned to Maia with as much haste as possible. Drawing to a premature halt she tried to clear her face of the involuntary flush that had settled on it.\n'Is everything okay?' she asked, cold dread chipping away at her stomach.\n'Thanks, Luke,' she replied, hesitating then pushing through those all-too-familiar double doors again. This was becoming something of a ritual, she realised. She'd be surprised if these bright sterilised doors didn't make an appearance in one of her frequent nightmares in the near future.\nReaching for the cool slab to push forward into Lorelai's secluded room Diana felt her hand slip away from contact. Looking through the plastic that separated the returnee from the rest of the hospital, Diana saw her engulfed in a hug with Rory and, alongside and looking altogether ecstatic, was Christopher. While she watched he reached out and touched Lorelai's cheek with evident affection.\n'I've said all I have to say to you,' Diana said icily.\nFalling silent, Diana contemplated what Lorelai thought on the matter. Emily was right: Rory wasn't to find out yet. And, perhaps, Diana would grudgingly concede she was correct on another count- from watching this family scene she would guess that Rory did desire a proper family unit.\n'Before I...?' Shaking her head, Diana turned and walked right away from Emily Gilmore.\nLuke was talking to Sookie at the other end of the corridor. Beckoning to Maia, Diana took her hand firmly and walked out of the hospital without looking back. Thankfully, Maia didn't argue on that point. Diana didn't have the strength for a fight: Emily Gilmore had just knocked the stuffing out of her. And, despite the yearning inside to turn back immediately and barge into Lorelai's room whatever Rory and Christopher might say, she carried on in a straight path to the kerb where she hailed a taxi.\nShe felt empty. Even with Maia clutched at her side she felt she was missing a chunk of herself. Still, she kept herself moving mechanically and barely recognised when they reached Stars Hollow.\nThe town was still in recovery by the looks of it. There was a huge tarpaulin over the site of the accident and investigation crews made it clear to Diana that the assassination theory was being investigated meticulously. However, there were some indications that the news from Hartford had already filtered through. The doors to Miss Patty's dance studio were thrown open and loud music was blaring out from inside. The pizza shop that lived just off the main street had a sign saying that anyone who ordered a Lorelai-style pizza got it free provided they could name all sixteen toppings off by heart.\nDiana almost smiled but couldn't muster the energy. It was only when she found Tom sat on the doorstep of the Gilmore house that she remembered his promise.\nUpstairs she almost found herself floundering. The bed was crumpled from when they hurriedly left it on Sunday morning to attend the poetry reading that never happened. That all seemed so long ago now. It might not have happened at all for what Diana felt towards it. At the time she'd thought it was too good to last.\nKudos for being right, huh?\n'I want to go home,' Maia chimed in softly.\nLetting him lead the way Diana didn't look back into the living room. Somehow she thought her resolve would crumble if she deigned to do that. Flicking the switch in the hallway she said a silent farewell then slotted her arm through Maia's as they left the house in darkness."

She is married to Mike, has two adult sons and one adorable grandson. She is a fan of strong coffee, warm conversations and happy people.\nGot a mantra? I am always on the hunt. Seems like I need a phrase, a song, a scripture to tame my ever-wandering mind. I have embraced many mantras over the years. Funny thing is, the mantra itself continues to morph. It\u2019s never static, always evolving \u2013 like my faith, like my discipleship, like my yearnings.\nWhat good is a mantra? It is an anchor, a north star, a grounding of sorts. When I become overwhelmed with anxiety, frustration, grief or confusion, I need to find a home, a safe room, a cozy place near to the heart of God.\nA definition of a personal mantra: a positive phrase or affirmation that one repeats for encouragement. It could be a favorite quote, proverb, spiritual truth or religious saying that motivates and inspires you to be your best self. This phrase of special significance may be sung, spoken aloud or repeated silently as a prayer or meditation.\nFor me, reciting and repeating the inspirational phrase is an important spiritual discipline. It is a reminder, not unlike a tattoo or a string tied around a finger. The mantra\u2019s power is that it draws me out of my current bind and prompts me to recall a spacious, safe place where I can rest in the love of God.\nReminder: I am not in control.\nReminder: Holy One, let me seek your version of what is best.\nHands to work, hearts to God.\nReminder: Be God\u2019s hands and feet with my doing, be close to God\u2019s heart with my being.\nReminder: This is my calling.\nReminder: God is light and in God, there is no darkness at all.\nReminder: Apart from Christ, I can do nothing.\nMy perceptions about life, love and faith are clarified and healthier.\nMantras have steadied me and gave me courage.\nI am reminded of my place in the world.\nThey calm me, call me to prayer and remind me to breathe.\nA friend recently told me of her practice to choose a word for the year. Her word for 2016 is flourish. She uses it frequently in her social media posts, hashtags and as she reviews her purposes each year.\nMight I suggest a mantra of the month? For me, a mantra must be flexible, somewhat alluring, and definitely timely. For now, I am going to use this one: Love is a verb. I know, kind of predictable, right? Not sure it has the stickiness that I will need forever, but for now, it is more than enough.\nMay the words of my heart and the meditation of my heart be pleasing to you, O Lord, my rock and my redeemer.

Simply put, I look young. Like, very, very young. I\u2019m thirty years old, but haven\u2019t aged since I was sixteen; the whole \u201c13 Going On 30\u201d but in reverse. Perhaps it\u2019s just my genes, or maybe it\u2019s my twice daily moisturizing since I actually was sixteen. Either way, I\u2019ve got an eternally youthful glow, and the fine people of the world won\u2019t ever let me forget it. On a very regular basis I have people in utter shock that I am as old as I am, let alone above the age of twenty (seriously, it would shock you to hear how little tact some folks have). Just yesterday the girl working at the supermarket asked me if I wanted a coupon from the store to bring to my school (re: high school) for points for some sponsored something or other. To be honest, I tuned out after she asked if I wanted a coupon to take to school.\nSeems like yesterday..or was it???\nWhen I put on the Day 3 video this morning and heard what the mantra was to be, it was clear what it was that I needed to embrace today. And the best part? Much of the practice was intrinsically childish in the best ways possible.\n2. Lions Breath. The goofiest pose of them all. Need I say more?\n3. One of my favorite Find What Feels Good\u2019isms: Thriller Arms. Every time I go into this pose, I\u2019m reminded not to take myself too seriously. Michael Jackson would be proud.\n4. Lots and lots of time in Uthhita Balasana \u2013 Extended Childs Pose.\nWe all have our insecurities, every single one of us. Of course how much we let them get in the way is entirely up to us, but there isn\u2019t a person on this planet who has never felt this about themselves at one point or another. For me, it always has been, and possibly always will be, how young I look. But I have learned to at least poke fun at it whenever possible, and today\u2019s practice let me do just that. It let me embrace that insecurity, and I hope this post will inspire you to embrace whatever it is that can bring you down sometimes, too. I hope it also serves as a reminder to embrace your inner child as well.\nAnd if you\u2019re ever unsure of just how to embrace this child \u2013 be it outer or inner \u2013 just wear pigtails. Always wear pigtails."

As she was a dear friend and an inspiration, I often wondered what was her secret to long life. Her response: \"Young men and chocolate!\"\nBeato was an honorary member of our Goddess Gang, a gaggle of women in search of balance, being in the world and of it as well. We would gather around her at her studio and laugh and eat and listen. Beato had a wonderful way of listening. As her hearing waned, so did her tolerance for pontification. She didn't take herself too seriously; she was an observer of people and contrasts. It was her irreverence that kept her going. She had no fear of death.\nSeveral years ago, Beatrice was there for me when my husband was threatened with cancer. She openly shared her own travails and soothed me with the knowledge that she was speaking in past tense. During this difficult time, Beato threw an outdoor bash for my husband. A celebration of his health and recovery. Nothing was mentioned about sick or well, no pity was aroused. Beato arranged the seating herself. At the center table she placed herself with my husband on her left and men all around. Before we sat down she whispered in my ear, \"I adore your husband, can I keep him?\" \"No,\" I said, \"but you can borrow him for tonight.\" And that she did!\nAlthough her art is a glorious reminder of her spirit, we could not keep her, only borrow her for a lovely while. For that we are truly blessed."

The guy was pretty well off, and she'd never have to worry about making a living with him, but as soon as she saw him she didn't like him.\nShe obeyed her mother. She forced herself to spend a lot of time with him and used the power of suggestion to persuade herself to like him. Eventually she even came to love him.\nThen he told her he wanted to break up. \"All this effort,\" she said angrily, \"and I just now got myself to love you!\"\nHe looked at her coldly. \"But you never got me to love you.\"\nJimmy's a mouse. One day he came home from a blind date and wouldn't eat a thing. He moped around a whole day.\n\"What is it?\" his mom asked. \"What happened on your blind date?\"\nJimmy sighed. \"Just when we saw each other, a big yellow cat rushed out and picked her up in its mouth and ran off. It was love at first sight\u2026.\"\n\"Ah, don't be so sad. I'll set you up again in a couple of days.\"\nJimmy started to cry. \"But it was the big yellow cat I fell in love with\u2026.\"\n\"I'm here\u2026.\" Stone dialed Gold's number as soon as he arrived in Beijing.\nLast time, when Gold had visited his city, he'd given him a place to stay and fed him as well. Gold had shaken his hand warmly when he left. \"You're a good man,\" he'd said earnestly. \"Call me if you're ever in Beijing.\"\n\"Hunh? I'm really sorry, I'm not in Beijing\u2026.\" Gold apologized profusely on his end of the call.\nStone hung up regretfully and headed off to wait for a bus under the sign. He'd only walked a couple of steps when, all of a sudden, he saw Gold hurrying across the crosswalk at the other end of the street.\nThey met by the elevator at work, and in time they came to secretly like each other. One day he got up the courage to write her a letter and send it off. She didn't respond.\nAfter that day she wasn't willing to look him in the eye. He was hurt, and left the company. She cried alone when he was gone\u2026.\nNo one knew that, the same day he'd sent her that letter, she'd also sent him a love letter. To this day they're still in the downstairs mailbox, the one nobody ever bothers about.\n\"Gao Qiming, I like you.\"\n\"Qiming, I want to marry you.\"\n\"Ming, your daughter says she misses you. Come home soon.\"\nGao Qiming has always felt that these four messages in his phone are the warmest of his life.\nGrandma called Uncle to her side as she lay on her deathbed. Pointing to a small locket on her breast, she said with a smile, \"The jewelry has already been parceled out, right? This is a treasure the old man gave me. I have to take it with me\u2026.\"\nAfter she'd been cremated, Uncle couldn't keep the others from opening the locket. Inside was a piece of paper, yellowed with age.\nIt was a drawing of a pair of lovers sitting under a tree. The man was putting a flower in the woman's hair\u2026.\nI suddenly remembered that Grandpa had been illiterate.\nHe wrote a love letter to a beautiful editor at a literary magazine. A week later he received a letter from her. She'd written only three words: \"Please Submit Elsewhere\".\nThe applause thundered in the concert hall as he finished playing the final piece of his solo recital. He looked steadily at his father below the stage.\n\"Pa, you made me study for 20 years. Today when I got up on this stage, your dream came true. But starting tomorrow I'm going to do something I want to do\u2026. Even though I've long since forgotten what it was.\"\nShe'd told her husband, \"If you ever cheat on me, I'll cut you both down.\" Her premonition unfortunately came true.\nOne day she saw on her husband's QQ chat record that he'd hooked up with a girlfriend behind her back, and was getting together with her. She was angry and upset, but after seeing the cold glint of the blade, she decided to call it quits and divorce him instead.\nShe'd thought she wouldn't be able to leave him. As it turned out, she only had to edit a few lines of the script. On the stage of her life, she was still the director.\nYoung Wang was sitting in a coffee shop when a girl walked over and asked, \"Are you here for a blind date arranged by Auntie Wong?\"\nYoung Wang looked her up and down. \"Just my type,\" he thought to himself. \"Why not make the make the best of it.\"\n\"Right,\" he answered. \"Have a seat.\"\nOn the day they were getting married, he came clean and told her that he hadn't been there for a blind date. She smiled and said, \"I wasn't either. I used that as an excuse to start a conversation\u2026.\"\nAh-Biao's cell phone rang. It was an unfamiliar number.\nHe answered it. \"Hello. Who's calling, please.\"\nGrandma, is that you!? Things are OK back in the village, aren't they?\"\n\"First talk to your Grandpa. He's about to\u2026. It's not good.\" Grandma choked down a sob.\n\"Biao,\" Grandpa said, \"I miss\u2026 you.\"\nThe phone went silent. This was the first time Ah-Biao had heard his Grandpa's voice over the phone.\n\"I don't have a fancy car or a luxurious home, but I do have a heartfelt love for you\u2026.\" He sent the finished love letter off to the girl he venerated.\nThe next day he got a text message from her: \"I believe your motives are sincere, but S says he's willing to give up his fancy car and luxurious home for me, even though he's a billionaire. I have substantial doubts about that, so I've decided to give him a chance to prove it.\"\nThe chief administrator of a hospital and the manager of a telecom company were attending a dinner party.\nDuring the meal someone said, \"Your two businesses are really very much alike. You're both service enterprises. And neither of you keeps after your customers until you've smashed them to the point they no longer want to live.\"\n\"We're not alike,\" the telecom manager said. \"Sometimes our company gives gifts to people paying their subscriber fees, like cell phones or soy bean oil.\"\nThe hospital administrator said, \"And sometimes the gynecology unit of our hospital gives consumers a child\u2026.\"\nSandy got a job as a secretary with a big company when she graduated from college. She'd been on the job several days without being given any work to do, so she asked her boss about it.\n\"Just worry about getting to work on time,\" the boss said with an ambiguous smile. \"The company's big enough to carry you, don't you think?\"\nSandy scowled and told her boss she was quitting. He did everything he could to get her to stay, but she walked away proudly.\nHer bag was stolen with more than two hundred Yuan and her cell phone in it. She kept sending out text messages saying she was willing to buy the phone back, increasing the price from one hundred to one thousand Yuan, but the thief didn't reply.\nBut then, just as she was giving up hope, she received an unexpected package containing her phone and a piece of paper.\n\"Please forgive me for looking at the videos in your phone,\" it said. \"I can't take your money, 'cause I have a daughter the same age as your kid.\"\nThe boss liked to play ping pong, and he wanted to find a place in the office where he could set up a table. The problem was, there wasn't any room.\nYoung Li saw what the boss was thinking. He decided to make the man happy and get himself noticed. He pushed some of the tables in the lunchroom together as a makeshift ping-pong table.\nYoung Li always looked to see what the boss wanted; the boss had been looking for a creative guy like that; and their co-workers are still looking for a place to eat lunch.\nShe noticed her mother had a habit of taking out a pile of letters and reading them every time she and Dad had an argument. She knew they were love letters Dad had written to Mom when they were young.\nShe also noticed that, every time Mom started reading the love letters, Dad would get out a can of ashes. She understood Mom's habit, but for the life of her, she couldn't understand Dad's.\nEventually she asked him about it. He smiled happily and said, \"Your mom's easily embarrassed. She made me burn her love letters.\"\nMiss Liu discovered that her boyfriend was starting to get friendly with a woman at work. She wanted to revive his feelings for her, so she wrote a love letter to herself and signed it with a coworker's name.\nShe gave the letter to her boyfriend. \"You'd better be careful,\" she said. \"If you don't want me, someone else will.\"\nWhen the boyfriend finished reading, it was like a burden had been lifted from his shoulders. \"I've been worried that you were dependent on me,\" he said, \"and no one else would want you if we split. Looks like my worries were exaggerated. I'm not worried anymore, so let's break up.\""

A wall of windows showcased an enviable view of the city far below, and a modern skyline.\nJessica scanned the table and smiled. Every business meeting was the same, regardless of the business being discussed.\nSatisfied that everything was ready, she moved to the sideboard and checked the carafe and water pitcher. Nothing would be served until the meeting was well underway, but she liked to be sure that the coffee was strong and hot, and the water ice cold.\nVoices in the hallway alerted her just before the door opened. Mr. Bracken was the first through the door, shooting her a tight smile and a barely perceptible wink before he moved to the seat at the head of the table and waved the other men through.\nThe three men who followed were dressed in nearly identical suits. The only variation was in the ties they wore, and even those were similar enough that they'd probably been bought at the same store.\n\"Gentlemen, please have a seat.\" Mr. Bracken waved the men to three seats facing the windows. Jessica knew it was deliberate; in the next thirty minutes the sun would be setting, and that light would come through at an angle that would have them squinting through the rest of the meeting. Her boss, and the owner of the multi-billion dollar company he'd founded, was a canny operator.\nThe men - Jessica had named them the Three Little Pigs in her mind - sat at the table and leaned back, confidence in every line of their careful body language.\n\"Mr. Bracken, let's get down to business.\" The first to speak, and the clear leader of the little group, she'd named Straw for his blond hair.\n\"By all means, Mr. Lane.\"\n\"Our company is a valuable property, one we believe will provide an essential service to your corporation...\"\nStraw continued, but Jessica tuned him out to focus on what wasn't being said.\n\"...gotta get out from under...\"\nBetween the three of them, Jessica pieced together a fairly clear picture of the business they were hoping sell. A clearer picture than they'd have painted themselves, certainly. The men ignored her; they'd taken her for a secretary or assistant of some sort: barely step up from furniture and not worth noticing.\nEven if someone happened to glance her way, the invisibility of the virtual keyboard ensured that their suspicions wouldn't be raised. With a final tap, she sent the information she'd gleaned to the smart watch on her boss's wrist.\nAs the sales pitch wound down, Mr. Bracken leaned forward . She didn't need her ability to read minds to know that there was going to be blood in the water, and very soon.\n\"Gentlemen, let's be honest here; your company is in trouble. Big, expensive trouble.\" His flat statement had an immediate effect, as did the details of their troubles he followed up with.\n\"Sir, I'm not sure where you've received your information from...\" The second of the three, Twig for his long thin arms, sat forward with a concerned frown as Straw voiced his objections.\nWait, not all three of them had panicked. She looked around at the table.\nSitting quietly, arms crossed, was Brick. Solid, steady, and completely unconcerned.\nWell, wasn't that interesting? Jessica thought.\nShe concentrated on the big man, focusing on him and blocking the others. When she hit a mental wall she had to smile - she had named him Brick, after all.\n\"We weren't aware that you employed a sensitive, Mr. Bracken.\" His voice was as solid as he was, and it stilled the other two instantly.\nAnd that's why he is the one in charge, Jessica realized. Not Straw, even if he is the CEO. Brick is the power behind the throne.\nWhen she turned back to her boss, she saw that he'd realized the same thing.\n\"I employ a great number of people, Mr. Craft. Would you care to specify?\" His voice was smooth and unperturbed. Jessica didn't feel quite so calm - in three years, she'd never been detected - but she took her cue from him.\n\"Ms. Jessica Winter, standing so attentively behind you. Waiting to serve coffee, I believe.\" His eyes met hers, and she felt a jolt of recognition. Of the three, Brick had been the only one who hadn't made eye contact with her at some point. Now she knew why.\n\"I'm not the only sensitive in the room, Mr. Craft. Shall we have full disclosure then?\"\nShe smiled and moved to bring the serving tray to the table as the other two turned to their business partner in shock and disbelief. A little chaos and distrust served with a cup of strong coffee always moved a business deal along quickly, she'd found.\nThis post is a response to a writing prompt from The Daily Post - \"A mad scientist friend offers you a chip that would allow you to know what the people you\u2019re talking to are thinking.

From the cosy over-stuffed furniture in the living room, to the colours he'd picked for the sheets on her bed. She'd been worried, when he'd opened the door, that it would be like the castle somehow. But it wasn't. She supposed that was because one doesn't decorate a vintage loft quite the same way a multibillionaire would outfit his supposed ancestral home.\nThere were fresh flowers in the kitchen every Wednesday and Friday. Never roses, tulips, or sunflowers. She was never sure how he'd known to stay away from those particular blooms. She'd enjoyed the daises the best. Something about daisies always seemed to brighten her mood. The lilacs had been nice as well, and she wished they hadn't been whisked away quite so quickly. The waxy blooms hadn't even begun to brown when she came to get a cup of coffee and discovered the tiger lilies had supplanted them.\nWhen she'd first moved to Smallville\u2014when they still had the house on Oak, she'd arrived to find her father had painted her new bedroom. The dominant hues had been pink and peach. She hadn't had the heart to tell him that it wasn't perfect. When she turned 15, Pete and Clark had helped her re-paint the pink wall a shade of green that had seemed like a good idea when she'd been staring at a little 2 inch paint chip, but had been much more... green when they'd gotten the first two coats up. She'd ended up covering up most of that wall with her desk and bookshelves. It had been a shock, when the movers had hauled all her stuff over to the new house on Sycamore, to see the unbroken expanse of emerald.\nShe'd never bothered painting her new room. Lana had made noises about re-decorating the first few weeks, but half the boxes she'd packed stayed packed, and were in storage in the empty apartment above the Talon. Chloe and her dad had hauled them all up the week-end before the trial.\nIt seemed a million years ago.\nThe bedroom Lex had created for her was all warm tones, but not a drop of pink to be found. Tan, ochre, and pumpkin with cheerful butter-yellow trim. It should have been garish. Like most things Lex was involved it, the planning always seemed over the top, but somehow he always pulled it together in the execution. The windows looked out over a rooftop garden, the city skyline rendered Impressionist by distance and summer heat. The bathroom had a tub deep enough to drown in, and there were never any cobwebs in the corners of the high ceilings. If there were, the unseen maids took care of them while Chloe was sleeping. Sometimes she felt like Beauty in that old French movie. She expected to see candles floating across the rooms if she turned a corner quick enough to catch them.\nThe closet was full of clothes in her size. Everything the hip young 17 year old in Metropolis could ever want, from $200 Diesel jeans to hand-painted tops from Spain and Japan. She'd recognised his taste in a few items\u2014and she'd wondered if he'd handed the task of outfitting her to a minion, or if he'd actually called up the designers himself. He'd even arranged for a stylist to come over once a month, if she wanted a haircut. She hadn't, and her bangs were too long and she had visions of waking up at 3am and hacking away at them with nail scissors one of these days. But they were just idle fancies. She supposed in another month or two, it might be a different story.\nThe fridge was always stocked. It had to be, since she couldn't actually run out to the store. If there was something she craved, she either wrote it on the message pad magnetted to the giant stainless-steel doors, or picked up a phone and called the guard, who called someone else, who brought it to her. From Thai to a hotdog from the stand across the street from the baseball stadium, she'd yet to make a request that wasn't met within 45 minutes.\nIt was better than Domino's.\nThe flat screen TV got every channel. She had no idea what the monthly cable bill must cost, but she guessed it was equivalent to a year's tuition at Kansas State. She'd spent three days watching nothing but the BBC, and soon switched to alternating between Bollywood musicals and Argentinean soaps. There was a case of DVDs with everything from His Girl Friday to Girl With A Pearl Earring. He even had screeners of all the stuff which opened in theatres delivered week by week, but somehow, she just couldn't imagine sitting on her couch, watching Troy without Pete or Lana right there beside her, either to ridicule the history or drool over Eric Bana in leather.\nClark was never in the picture. Clark hadn't been in the picture for a long time. And it didn't hurt this summer the way it had last summer. She wasn't sure quite why. She still missed her friend, but it wasn't the same way she missed Pete and Lana.\nEven if she hadn't testified against Lionel, she would have had to have faced a summer without them. When she'd first heard about the Ross's marital problems, she'd sympathised, having lived through divorce herself. But it had come as a shock. The last time she'd seen Mr and Mrs Ross together had been their annual Homecoming backyard barbecue, and everything had seemed so normal as Mr Ross had handed out charred burgers and brats, while Judge Ross had made sure no one lacked for potatoe salad or lemonade.\nOf course, nothing had shocked her quite the way Lana's sudden yen to travel had. She didn't even speak French, and aside from decorating the Talon, had never really shown much interest in art. It had hurt, finding out that Lana had already talked to Nell and made all the arrangements to apply to school on another continent, leaving Chloe completely out of the loop because she hadn't trusted her.\nI just can't wait to get out of here and go somewhere where people don't judge me.\nDriven was never quite the word Chloe would have used, to describe Lana. In her less charitable moments, \"self-involved\" was more easily expressed as \"spoiled\" and \"convinced the universe revolves around Miss Lana Lang.\"\nWhat hurt most\u2014what had always hurt the most\u2014was that the universe really did seem to revolve around Lana. It was jealousy, plain and simple. Clark's universe had revolved around the raven-haired Lana from the moment Chloe had met him. Even Lex went out of his way to make sure no waves ever splashed up against her shores, disturbing the mirror-surface of her tranquil little world. The Talon was failing financially? Oh, he'd hem and haw and make noise about selling. But in the end, everyone always made sure that Lana landed on her feet. Everyone\u2014including Chloe. She could have been free of her sometimes-rival, sometimes-sister once and for all, but she'd begged her father to let Lana move in with them. Not so much because she'd wanted Lana there, so much as to keep one more person in her life from abandoning her completely.\nChloe hadn't exactly landed on her feet, this time. Not without some hard knocks that had left bruises and scars that she was beginning to think would never fade. In her perfect apartment where she wasn't allowed to cross the street to get a paper and a cup of coffee, Chloe was utterly alone. It was a lovely gilded cage, but a cage all the same. And she'd handed over the key knowingly, believing it was all for the best.\nThe first time Lex had come to find the place trashed and Chloe curled up on the corner of the couch, still in her flannel pyjama pants and tank top, her face puffy and red from crying, he'd just knelt at her side and touched her shoulder. That had been all it took for her to dissolve into waterworks all over again.\nHe'd held her awkwardly as she'd cried herself out, not even bothering to whisper hollow words of comfort, because that's not who he was and that's not who she wanted him to be.\nThe second time, he'd easily ducked the cut crystal vase she'd thrown clumsily as he'd stepped through the foot-thick door. The shards remained there all night.\nAll she wanted was her father.\nThe next morning, the flowers in the kitchen hadn't been changed. One of the orchids was just beginning to brown around the edges, marring the perfect white petals, and Lex had made her an omelette with goat cheese and tomatoes while she'd brewed the coffee."

                            "text": "To the untrained eye, Lorne Davis' death would appear to have been caused by a heart attack. Not an uncommon occurrence for an eighty-six year old man, but if you looked at the little things surrounding his death, well, then you'd noticed some things didn't add up. To Tanner Davis, however, a hardened LA cop, little things could mean and add up to a lot. There was the matter of Lorne landing face up. Not the usual way for a man suffering pain to land. Then there was the missing hat and jacket, which Lorne should have been sporting one or the other. There was also the fact he was wearing his town clothes and as he wasn't one to go about admiring his ranch, that was rather odd too. But the biggest and most damning thing about Lorne's death was the missing gold coins that only the family would know about and they were gone. Had Lorne truly had a heart attack or had he met with foul play?\nShaye Townsend was working for the Ranch Conservancy. She and Lorne had reached an agreement that he would let his land be held in trust by the Conservancy until his death at which time the Conservancy would take it over. He did have certain stipulations, however, that had to be met before he'd sign on the dotted line--namely, that the Conservancy guarantee that the ranch be preserved the way it was and not be traded or sold under any circumstances. While Shaye was out of town, however, her boss took the final paperwork over to be signed, only the contract was the wrong one. She'd grabbed the a contract without the agreed upon amendments from their legal department. Upon returning to Refuge, Shaye headed over to Lorne's ranch to explain the error and smooth things over. He'd been refusing her calls so she'd hope she personally be able to explain the blunder and regain his trust. The only problem was that that would never happen. When Shaye reached Lorne's ranch he was dead. She'd been the one to find him and call the authorities. The two had become friends over their negotiations and she would truly miss him. Her only regret was that he'd died angry with her thinking she'd tried to trick him.\nWhat neither Tanner nor Shaye could have guessed was that Shaye would be instrumental in unlocking what really happened to Lorne.\nThis was a fun read. Shaye was a fun character caught in a bad situation. She loves her work and believes in what she is doing. Part of her job is to try to get ranchers to leave their land to the Ranch Conservancy, a group dedicating to preserving small ranches by snatching them up before commercial industry has a chance to grab them. Some of the land they've been entrusted with even has wild mustangs roaming around. When Shaye's boss, Kimberli, messed things up by giving Lorne the wrong contract, Lorne made a big stink about the mix up. Enough of a stink that other ranchers in the area were starting to rethink their plans about entrusting the Conservancy with their ranches. But trying to go on back to business as usual and acting as if nothing had happened wasn't easy for Shaye. She'd been deeply affected by his death. She'd like the old man and was sad she'd never see him again and her last images of him weren't pleasant ones as she'd found his body some time after the scavengers of the area had gotten to him. Not a pretty sight, and not one she'd soon forget. When she first meets Lorne's nephew, Tanner, he wasn't in the best of moods and they didn't immediately hit it off. The one word she'd use to describe him was rude.\nTanner Davis is an LA detective used to working the homicide beat. He's not happy about being pulled away from LA and back to Refuge. He never really wanted to come back. He'd hoped to quickly settle his uncle's estate and be on his way, but when he learns all the facts about his uncle's death he can't help but try to figure out what happened to the old man. While the two weren't close during his final years, they were family. Upon first meeting Shaye he wonders what she'd do to get a ranch, but quickly dismisses that thought as he gets to know her. He soon realizes she truly is saddened by his uncle's passing and the two start working together to put the pieces together of Lorne's final days. With Shaye's help doors that would normally not be opened to him are. While in the midst of their investigation, the two find themselves undeniably attracted to one another.\nOverall I gave this one 3 1/2 out 5 roses.There was plenty of drama, intrigue and romance. I liked the mystery of what exactly happened to Lorne and how the two worked together to figure it out. I also enjoyed that Shaye didn't have to give up what she loved to get a happy ending and that Tanner didn't ask her to.\nAbove: The way I imagine Lorne's ranch to look."

Everything else\u00e2\u0080\u0094including pacifying a beautiful crusader on a mission best left resting in peace\u00e2\u0080\u0094is secondary. But as Kate's search embeds her in his world and attracts a skilled criminal, she needs Mac's protection. Drawn together by deadly secrets, they must find a way to trust each other before a killer silences them both.\n\u201cCrisp writing and distinctive characters make up Perry's latest novel.\nI'm so glad you decided to read the final book in my Blackburn House series. I've especially enjoyed writing this series because I've been able to pick up pieces from real Pennsylvania small towns to incorporate in the stories, which makes the setting very real to me. In fact, the clock tower on the cover is actually the clock tower on Main Street in the town where I live!\n, police chief Mac Whiting finally meets his match in a woman who is just as stubbornly determined to do the right thing as he is. After getting to know Mac in the two earlier books, I hope you enjoy watching as he and Kate battle each other as well as the forces of wrong to find their own happily-ever-after.\n, or write to me at HQN Books, 195 Broadway, 24th FL, New York, NY 10007.\nwho always believes in me, with much love.\nDeath isn't the greatest loss in life.\nThe greatest loss is what dies inside of us while we live.\nbe a place where people were buried\u00e2\u0080\u0094not where they died. Kate Beaumont, confronted so unexpectedly with the place Jason had chosen to end his life, stopped the car in mid-traffic, earning an irritated honk from the driver behind her as he was forced to come to a halt, as well.\nThe driver circled her, looking annoyed but refraining from the rude gesture she anticipated. Apparently drivers were a bit more polite in a small town like Laurel Ridge, Pennsylvania, than they were in the city. Her hands were shaking, and not from the sudden stop. She pulled off the road near the stone wall that encircled the graveyard.\nRidiculous, to let just the sight of the place send her into a tailspin. She was tougher than that, wasn't she? But while she could face down a recalcitrant politician or an irate citizen in search of a story, she couldn't maintain that level of detachment where her younger brother's death was concerned.\nKate took a long breath, fighting to still the tremors that shook her. She focused on the scene facing her, thinking of how she'd describe it for a newspaper article.\nLaurel Ridge's cemetery covered the top of a rounded hill at the eastern end of town. Spreading maples, their leaves already turning color, shielded gray tombstones. Some of the stones were worn and tilted, their lettering eroded, while others were new enough to make it obvious the cemetery was still in use. The whole place had a well-tended air, the grass mown, with beds of gold-and-burgundy chrysanthemums blossoming here and there.\nWhich was the stone Jason had leaned against when he'd taken that fatal dose of pain meds and swallowed that final mouthful of whiskey? She could find it, she supposed, since the name had shown clearly in the newspaper photo she'd scanned online. But looking at the spot wouldn't lead her to any answers.\nMovement reflected in the rearview mirror startled her, and her stomach tightened as she realized a police car had pulled up behind her. Great. All she needed was to draw official attention to herself before she'd even begun the task that brought her here.\nAn officer slid from the vehicle and started toward her. Taking a firm grip on her nerves, Kate planted a smile on her face and hit the button to roll down her window.\nShe was about to speak when a closer look at the man's uniform gave her another shock. The lettering on his pocket read M. Whiting. McKinley Whiting, then. Chief of Police in this backwater town, and the man who'd dismissed her little brother's death as just another druggie overdosing himself.\nKate gritted her teeth, fighting to keep her feelings from showing as she looked up at the man. Tall and lean, he had dark hair in a military-style cut and a jaw that conveyed determination. He didn't affect the dark sunglasses so many cops did, and his brown eyes studied her, missing nothing, she felt sure.\n\u201cAre you having car trouble, ma'am?\u201d His voice was a bass rumble.\nReading the surprise in his face, she clamped her lips shut before she could make matters worse. She'd overdone it\u00e2\u0080\u0094lost her cool and let her feelings show. The last thing she wanted was to rouse the suspicions of the local cop before she'd been in town for five minutes.\nHe left it hanging there, obviously intent on learning her name. For the first time she was glad her name wouldn't connect her with Jason Reilley.\n\u201cNo.\u201d Guilt and grief were a powerful combination. She should have. If she'd come to visit Jason the summer he'd spent here, maybe he'd still be alive.\nThat was the danger of loving someone. It hurt too much when you let them down.\nWhiting's eyes were probing again. If she'd worn a sign, it probably wouldn't have been more obvious that she was hiding something.\nHe nodded, again with that watchful look. Protective, that was what it was. As if his town might need protecting against her. Well, maybe it did.\nShe hadn't expected that casual reference to the bed-and-breakfast, and it shook her. Would it be the same one where Jason had stayed when he came to Laurel Ridge? If so, it was going to be one of her first stops.\n\u201cOkay, thanks.\u201d She managed a cool, dismissive smile. \u201cI appreciate the recommendation.\u201d She turned the ignition key, her fingers brushing the silver dragon charm Jason had given her, and put her finger on the window button.\nWhiting looked at her for a moment longer, and then slowly stepped back so she could close the window. She put the car in gear, glanced behind her and pulled out. It was simple enough to watch Whiting in her rearview mirror. He'd drawn out a notebook and was jotting down her license number.\nShe doused a flicker of anger. A search of her license wouldn't tell him anything except her address in Baltimore. She'd never been arrested, so a query to the police there wouldn't help him, even if he went that far.\nBut this encounter had clearly shown her that she'd have to do better. True, she hadn't expected the first person she'd meet in Laurel Ridge to be the policeman who'd been quoted in that article about Jason's death. She might be excused for losing her grip just a bit, but it was unfortunate. She'd made herself an object of his interest before she'd had a chance to do a single thing.\nBut what difference did it make in the long run? Sooner or later she'd have to divulge the relationship between her and Jason. If she didn't, she'd have no reason for asking questions about him.\nShe'd toyed with the thought of trying to conceal her identity. She could have claimed to be writing a newspaper story about Jason's death, but that didn't sound credible even to herself, not after over a year had passed.\nKate made the turn onto Main Street and drove down it at a sedate speed, reading signs as she went. There, ahead of her on the left, was the caf\u00c3\u00a9 Whiting had mentioned, and on her right the bed-and-breakfast. She slowed, peering toward the rear of the white clapboard building, and caught a glimpse of a small building nearly hidden by the trees. That had to be it\u00e2\u0080\u0094the cottage where Jason had lived during his three months in Laurel Ridge.\nAnd next to the bed-and-breakfast rose the imposing Italianate building that was Blackburn House, where Jason had worked. The place where he'd lived, the place where he'd worked. That was where she had to begin.\nShe hadn't been here when Jason had needed her, but she was now. She'd find the answer to the question that haunted her, because if she didn't, she'd never be satisfied. What had happened in this seemingly quiet, peaceful town that had led to her brother's death?\nMain Street, keeping an eye on the compact car ahead of him. He wasn't following the woman exactly, but she had stirred his curiosity. Something had been just a little off-kilter about their conversation, and her defensiveness had startled as well as intrigued him.\nHe frowned, trying to put his finger on the exact source of his unease. Kate Beaumont had seemed vaguely familiar to him, but he couldn't quite place her. Thick, honey-blond hair was pulled casually back on the nape of her neck, allowing wavy tendrils to escape and curl around her ears. Her lightly tanned skin seemed touched by the gold in her hair, and even her eyes were a golden brown. Surely, if he'd ever known her, he'd remember. A man didn't run into that many brown-eyed blondes\u00e2\u0080\u0094and especially not one carrying a chip the size of a mountain on her shoulder.\nThe familiarity remained stubbornly elusive, so he put the resemblance on a back burner to percolate. It would come through, sooner or later. Meantime, it looked as if his mystery woman was going to take his advice. She'd pulled into a parking space across from the caf\u00c3\u00a9.\nA moment later he realized he'd jumped to conclusions. Ms. Beaumont wasn't headed toward the caf\u00c3\u00a9. Instead, she was walking up the sidewalk of Blackburn House. Now what, exactly, was she up to? Unless she had a sudden yen to buy quilt fabric or a book, there wasn't much in Blackburn House to attract a casual visitor.\nCuriosity had him turning in at the driveway that ran along the side of the building. At the rear of Blackburn House stood the old carriage house, converted into the workshop of Whiting and Whiting Cabinetry. Not that he was the Whiting or the son involved in the business. Dad might have had hopes in that direction at one time, but when Mac had come back from a stint in the military, he'd known the carpentry trade wasn't for him. Still, Dad seemed content with one son in partnership, and the business suited Mac's brother, Nick, perfectly.\nParking, Mac eyed the back door into Blackburn House. That might be a bit too blatant, running into the woman so quickly. She really would have cause to cry harassment if he did that, wouldn't she?\nInstead, he headed into the cabinetry shop, prepared for the usual din of saws and hammers. But all was fairly quiet at the moment. One of the Amish carpenters who worked in the shop sat on a bench in the rear, his lunch bucket beside him. He raised a thermos in Mac's direction, and Mac grinned and nodded.\nHe'd forgotten it was lunchtime. No doubt Nick was lunching with his fianc\u00c3\u00a9e, Allison, assuming she'd been able to get away from the quilt shop.\nHis father, instead of eating the lunch Mom had packed for him, was bending over a rocking chair, carefully hand-sanding a spindle. The normal work of the shop\u00e2\u0080\u0094custom-designed kitchen cabinets\u00e2\u0080\u0094sat all around him, but he was focused on the rocker instead.\nHis father looked up at his approach, pushing his glasses into place. Folks said Nick looked more like their father, but all three of them had the same lean, straight-featured faces. Dad's eyes crinkled at the sight of him.\n\u201cBetter not let Mom or Allison hear you complaining.\u201d Mac leaned against a handy workbench. Since he was safely removed now from the farmhouse that his brother, Nick, and Nick's young son shared with Mom and Dad, he could take a more detached view of Nick and Allison's wedding preparations.\nMac bent obediently over the chair, hands caressing the smooth curves of the fine maple. He might not want carpentry for his life's work, but he still enjoyed the calming nature of the skill. Seeing the grain gleam in response to his movements was satisfying.\n\u201cAnd?\u201d Dad seemed to be waiting for more. He had to know that that was the sort of thing that happened too often to cause comment."

                            "text": "The half demon had picked up her new friend, and so the two made their way towards the beach. \"I've been looking forward to this,\" she'd say with an excited giggle, \"I haven't been to a beach in forever.\"\nShe'd float besides her new friend, grinning, wearing a light shirt and shirts to cover her bathing suit. \"I'll buy us snacks from the stands,\" she'd smile, \"what kind of foods do you like?\"\nAs they neared the sand she'd let out a happy giggle and lay down a few large towels for them to sit on. \"Ok, now the fun can begin,\" she'd flash a playful grin, \"gonna show me how cute you look in that bathing suit?\"\n\"Yes, its a good day to come to beach.\" at least according Arnaaluk. The air was breezy and cloudy skies allowed only a few streams of sunlight past while temperatures hung around 13 degrees Celsius (or about 55 degree Fahrenheit depending on one's preferences). It was not the sunny skies that most people associate with the beach but there was still several beach goers and venders present.\n\"Anything with meat.\" was Arnaaluk's response to her colorful friend, whom bright attire contrasted the monochrome shades of her sealskin clothes.\nAs the pair approached her feet sunk into the sand with each step she the took while her tail dragged behind to make a sandy trail. Once their spot was claimed and their towels laid down, Arnaaluk began to shed her outer clothes to reveal the tight-fitting navy blue one piece swimsuit in its entirety now.\n\"Yeah, hold up while I fold my clothes before I strike a pose for you.\" answered Arnaaluk as she wore a smile on her face. Once she neatly folded her garments on top of her towel, she stood up tall and proud for view.\n\"Its cute right?\" she as as she rests a hand on her hip, a cheeky breeze stirring up her brown hair as if she was some sort swimsuit model.\nShe'd grin. \"Meat sounds good,\" the half demon chuckled, \"I saw some stands selling fish and some beef too, I'll get us some in just a bit.\"\n\"You look gorgeous~\" she'd float around her friend, looking her over as she did, \"that color really looks great on you.\" Blair would stop in front of her, \"amazing hon,\" she'd say with a playful smirk.\n\"Now, my turn,\" she'd pull her shirt and shorts off, letting them fall onto the towels. She wore a white bikini that was perhaps a bit inappropriate for someone her age, but that's just the way she was. \"Whatcha think?\" she'd ask with a smirk.\n\"Thank you. Your too kind Blair.\" chuckled the whale girl as she beams a bright, if toothy, smile. Afterwards Arnaaluk just stared at Blair for a moment. Though she had seen the pictures, it wasn't until Blair had it on that they realized how skimpy the swimsuit was. It was barely strings tied with some cloth covering her breast and pelvis while the rest of her creamy skin was laid bare for the sun to kiss. Or at least what little sun was out. But it did cover the parts it was suppose to hide, if only minimally.\n\"Oh! It nice... but... \" Arnaaluk pauses, rubbing one of her braids with her thumb and finger as she wonders if she should say her concerns. Concerns that her swimsuit was too delicate looking and barely held together but she was worried that might embarrass her friend.\n\"... I think you look great in it.\" smiled Arnaaluk, deciding no not accidentally critizing Blair. Maybe they just couldn't afford swimware that covered up more of her body. Less material made it less expensive right? \"Did you want to go get food first or swim a bit to work up more of an appetite later?\"\nShe'd giggle. \"Let's swim first,\" she'd excitedly bob up and down in the air, \"maybe we can catch a few fish? One of the stands will cook fish you bring in.\" In truth it was probably a bit cold for a non aquatic being, but she wanted to have fun.\nLanding, she'd stretch a bit. \"Ok, race you to water?\" with that she'd run towards the water, her friend might be able to catch her, she wasn't physically enhanced. Either way she'd dive right in, laughing when her head popped out of the water.\n\"Now I get to see that awesome tail of yours at work,\" she'd say with a giggle, \"so, can you breathe under water? Or maybe hold your breath super long?\" She'd swim over to her friend, watching her curiously.\nThe akhlut nods in agreement: swim first, meal second. In fact she even suggested that the two of them catch their food while swimming. While a good idea Arnaaluk knew if they wanted to catch anything but minnows they will have to swim a bit far out. Not that it was much an issue for a natural born hunter as herself but as for her friend Blair... she wasn't sure if she was truely up for the task. But then looks can be deceiving.\n\"Alright but whatever fish you catch you can cooked. Those that I catch I'll have raw.\" mused Arnaaluk as she proceeds to strech her arms and legs as well.\nArnaaluk would smirk at Blair's invitation for race but before she could even let out word they had scampered off to the water. Though her racing partner had a head start and her tail weighed her down on land, her superior form and length of her stride allowed her quickly catch up and surpass Blair as her feet touch touched the water first. Her momentum carried her until Arnaaluk was waist deep in water it was only then she spun around with a victorious smile on her face as she looked to how far behind Blair was behind her now.\n\"Oh I see you finally caught up\" piped up Arnaaluk as Blair popped her head just in front of her. After wearing that cocky smile for a few moments her face softens to more playful smirk as Blair asks her about all the sort of things she can do in the water.\n\"Well you will see it in action once I move out in deeper. I can hold my breath to up to about... 90 minutes before I need to breath. I can do far more than that while in the water. I can see with my echolocation much further out in water and take on the form of an orca if wish to.\"\n\"Ninety minutes?\" she'd ask, genuinely surprised, \"guess you really are made for the water.\" She'd swim around her a few times, using her levitation to push herself through the water some. \"Somehow....you're even prettier in the water, something about how you look in the water.\"\n\"An orca?\" she'd ask, \"that's so cool!\" She'd splash her a little, \"guess I won't be able to beat you in a swimming contest either,\" she'd say playfully with a giggle. She'd float on her back, her head gently bumping into her friend.\n\"What's it like?\" she'd ask, looking up at her, \"deep in the ocean? I've seen pictures, it looked beautiful, but also kinds scary too.\" Her tail swayed besides her as she spoke, \"I didn't get to explore much the last few years, was just stuck at home with my dad.\"\n\"Unlikey~\" chuckled Arnaaluk. She was born to swim after all. As Blair's head bumped into into her abs, Arnaaluk couldn't up but giggle as her red hair tickled against along her belly.\n\"Ha ha ha... watch where your drifting my friend.\" spoke Arnaaluk, her smile from laughter as she gently pushes Blair a little further away from her by pushing the girl's shoulders with just her thumbs.\n\"As for what its all like. Well... if you go deep enough its dark, quite, and feels like the water is going to crush you from all of the pressure. Its quite devoid of... well anything and my pod always speak of stories of monsters lurking if you go deep enough which is why we rarely swim down to the depths where the light doesn't reach.\" answered Arnaaluk, whom then decides to tell her a little more about the surface where she usually reside \"But on the surface, the waters are emerald green full of fish, seals and whales. It also very nosy as no matter where you swim there is always that ringing of boat propellers in the distance. So we all have to keep close so that we can all hear each other. I grew up used to it but my parents used to tell stories of how there was only the peaceful songs of whales that once filled the oceans.\"\n\"Arnnnnaaaa~\" she'd flash a teasing smirk, \"are you ticklish.\" The half demon would swim back towards her friend, \"oh my, the things I could do with this information.\" She'd giggle, wiggling a bit of her hair at her, \"when you least expect it, I'll pounce you, tickle torture you,\" she'd say jokingly.\nBlair would listen as her friend told of her of the ocea, both of the surfaceand underneath it. \"It sounds amazing,\" she'd smile, floating next her, \"maybe one day you can show it all to me, this world and everything in it is new to me.\"\nShe'd glance out at the ocean before turning back to Arna and splashing her before laughing some. \"You can show me new things and I can do the same,\" she'd tilt her head, \"together we'll figure out our new homes.\"\n\"P-please don't! I know it may seem funny but tickling is seen as torture among my people. Some of us would even be executed by being tickled to death! And I don't want to accidentally hurt you either.\" spoke up Arnaaluk with grave alarm in her voice as she a step back deeper into the water with frightened look on her face.\nIt was the sort of embarrassing to admit and something Arnaaluk preferred to keep to herself. People always seem to want to test how ticklish she is the moment she ever mentions it. Wether Blair was joking or intended to do she had to warn her how serious tickling was to her despite how innocent sounding it might have been. After making her concerns known she she lets out a sigh of relief while Blair stared out to the ocean, telling all about how they can both learn from their new home together... before splashing water her.\n\"That sounds like a fine plan to me. I like that idea very much.\" answered Arnaaluk whom proceeds splash a larger wake of water at Blair with childish glee. Her her successful assault against Blair she then asks \"In fact how about I show you some new things right now? Would you hold onto my back while I swim you around and catch fish for us?\""

                            "text": "Edwards Recreation Center - How big are the waves?\nDrew was very adamant about getting her in the water. It was sweet. She'd never understood the hype around beaches though. Salt water left your skin feeling weird sometimes, and sand got everywhere. She wouldn't be surprised if some of her dad\u2019s family was still getting sand out of their things after their last beach trip. They were Muggle, though, and had no idea there was a spell for that. Spells were like apps that way. Man, it'd be so cool to study technomancy and develop magical apps. Had anyone broken ground on that yet?\nAnyway, the beach. She liked sitting in the sun and reading. That's what she and Mom usually did when they went to Dad\u2019s family reunions. They didn't actually live on the beach, but apparently four hours was close enough for them. Again, they were Muggles, and they weren't lucky enough to apparate. She really liked being a half-blood. It gave her the best of both worlds. Plus, if she went into anthropology like her mom, she'd have so much more experience to work off of.\nShe could probably get in the water if there was a shallow end. The idea made her nervous, but she didn't want to admit that. Swimming was a skill she needed to learn, and it wasn't like Drew was going to force her out into the deep end. He was a good person; he seemed like a nice friend to have. He put up with alllll of Kit, after all. Only a really nice person would be able to do that for so long. She liked the redhead well enough, but she wasn't sure she had the patience to ever be as super close to Kit as Drew was. Especially with her new pet spider around. Remington could seriously do without seeing Darby every time Kit was around. He was certainly fascinating, but he gave her the creeps!\nRemington almost blushed when Drew accidentally suggested she change into a swimsuit. She knew that she still had one on under her romper, but he didn't know that. She wasn't entirely sure if the romper itself would be okay if it got wet, and she hadn't thought about asking an older student to charm it so it would be waterproof. Maybe she could, before going to the shallow end with Drew. Everyone she might ask was busy, though. Marissa Kendrick was talking to someone, she couldn't spot Rose after quickly glancing around, Holland was talking to Ruben, and, again, Remington knew she just was not mature enough to talk to him right now.\n\u201cI'll meet you down there,\u201d she agreed, smiling despite also wishing she'd brought a book instead. Assuming that Drew would follow her, Remington made her way to the identified shallow end. She still wasn't sure if she wanted to strip down to her swimsuit - although she recognized that at this point there were way more interesting things and people to stare at than how she looked in a bathing suit - and compromised. She rolled the legs of the romper as high as they went and stepped into the water. She shivered a little, surprised at the pleasant temperature of the water, and couldn't help but smile again. She couldn't wait to be this good at magic someday; it must feel amazing to make all of this happen.\nThis was silly. If she just took off the romper and then walked into the water, she'd be covered up. Plus, Drew was cool and totally wouldn't be thinking about how she looked in her suit. Coming to a decision, Remington stepped out of the water, found a sandy spot to wiggle out of and set down her romper, and quickly, but a little anxiously, waded up to her stomach. She was a little uncomfortable, but this could absolutely be worse."

                            "text": "The next day, Luke arrived early at the stable and began hitching up the horses. He'd done it so often that he was able to let his thoughts wander, and they wandered to Emma. What would she say, he wondered. What would he tell her about himself? He'd been distracted ever since he'd proposed they talk, and hadn't slept well. Writing had been an exercise in futility.\nNone of it had been helped by the phone call he'd made. As he did every month or so, he'd called home. His mother had answered, but as soon as she'd heard someone else come in the room, she'd hung up.\nNothing to be done about it, he reminded himself. Concentrate on Emma.\nHe'd just gotten the horses hitched when he saw Emma walking down the sidewalk towards him.\n\"Hi.\" She met his eyes, looked away, and then looked up again.\n\"Hey.\" His voice was soft. \"You're early.\"\n\"Am I?\" She looked at her watch. \"I guess I am. I live just down the street, so it doesn't take long.\"\n\"Really? Where do you live?\"\nShe gestured behind her. \"About four blocks that way.\"\n\"No kidding.\" Luke shook his head and chuckled. \"I must pass your place every day.\"\n\"You do.\" She gave him a shy smile. \"I watch the horses go by, it's my favorite part of the day.\"\n\"Well, come on.\" Luke held out a hand and forced a grin. \"Now you can watch from the carriage. It's a completely different perspective.\"\nEmma took his hand and climbed up in the carriage. She huddled into her coat, cold despite a hat, gloves, and scarf.\n\"Here.\" Luke reached back and got a blanket. \"I keep a few of these around.\" He winked. \"Never know what people might need.\"\nEmma laughed and arranged the blanket over her legs. \"You seem very prepared.\"\nHe shrugged and snapped the reins to start the horses. \"Never hurts.\"\nEmma bit her lip; something was bothering him. The smile and the wink were genuine, but there was something underneath. She knew how that felt. Pretending to smile when you wanted to cry; forcing down the anger; acting as though you had the Christmas spirit when you didn't.\n\"Can I ask what's wrong?\" She laid a tentative hand on his arm.\n\"Nothing much.\" Luke shrugged, then smiled at her. \"I'm a terrible host. I should be telling you about all the landmarks and historical buildings.\"\n\"It's okay. I'd rather talk about you.\" She took a deep breath. \"Or to you. That was the whole point of coming out, right?\"\n\"Yes, it was.\" Luke put one arm around her shoulders and pulled her close, then dropped a kiss on her forehead. \"So. What was that all about yesterday?\"\nEmma sighed. \"You really want to know?\"\n\"Okay.\" She closed her eyes. \"My sister, Lila, and I came here about three years ago. We sang together . . . I did the music, and wrote the lyrics, and we thought we had had something.\"\n\"I bet you did.\" Luke squeezed her.\n\"Then we met Sam. Sam Hollings. We were playing in this little club and he just . . . .\" Emma felt herself blush and wiped at her eyes. \"I guess I was just too stupid. He was handsome and slick and I believed everything he said. He told me . . . oh, God, he told me I didn't need Lila, that I did all the work and she was just dead weight. He said she was holding me back. I believed him. He was wrong, but I believed him.\"\nLuke was silent for a while. \"Then what?\"\nGrateful that he withheld comment, Emma made herself continue. \"I made an effort at first to say no, Lila and I were a team. But he kept at it and at it. He told me I didn't need her, that he had all these . . . contacts or something from people who were interested in me, if I would dump Lila. Then, I swear I couldn't tell you the first time it happened, but he got me on drugs.\n\"I can't believe that. I mean, I never wanted anything to do with drugs. At all. Lila and I, we were like, the cleanest kids ever in school. Then somehow . . . .\" She ran a hand through her hair. \"I don't know. It happened. I remember some things but not others.\"\n\"When you want something, really want it, it's hard not to do everything to get it.\" Luke kept his arm around her and his voice was low. \"Pressure is hard to resist, especially when the pressure is made to seem like it's good for you.\"\n\"Yeah.\" Emma rested her head on his shoulder. \"And I was so easy to pressure. He must have been laughing at me the whole time.\"\n\"Did he ever hurt you?\"\n\"No. I know it seems like he would have, and he did get me drugs, but he never hit me or anything like that.\"\nLuke nodded but said nothing. Protective instincts reared up with the desire to bash Sam's head in, but he took a deep breath. Can't do anything now, he thought.\n\"Anyway, I guess the rest is short, and you probably know what's coming.\" Emma pulled out a tissue and dabbed at her eyes and nose. \"I told Lila I agreed with Sam, that he found someone who was interested, but only in me. I told her I'd try to bring her in later, but . . . .\" She shrugged. \"Lila knew I didn't mean it. I was too strung out and too hung up on Sam. We were at this party, a Christmas party, when I told her. She left and I haven't seen her since.\n\"I stayed with Sam for a while, because I did believe him. I kept writing and singing and he kept saying, oh, sorry, it didn't work out but I have another guy I want to talk to. I was such an idiot.\"\n\"No,\" said Luke, \"he used you. It's no sin to believe in someone.\"\n\"Except he didn't believe in me.\" Emma let out a half-laugh. \"I was just someone to, I don't know . . . keep his bed warm, amuse himself. Then one day I was supposed to meet him and I got there early and I saw him talking to this girl. I walked up and just knew, you know? He told me how it just wasn't working, he had to focus on whatever-her-name-was, and could I have my stuff out by the next morning. I kind of . . . fell apart after that.\"\nEmma was drained, and they were quiet as the horse clapped along the street. There was more to the story: how she'd been on the streets for a couple of weeks, then found a girl she'd met through Sam, and who knew his MO. She helped Emma get back on her feet, get into rehab, and then later, she'd met Millie and gotten her job and apartment.\nAfter a few blocks, Emma said, \"You know what one of the worst things is?\"\n\"Every sort of milestone, every bad thing, happened around Christmas.\" She shook her head and brushed away some straggling tears. \"Lila and I made our promise to come here on Christmas. I chased her away at a Christmas party. Sam dumped me at Christmas.\"\n\"It's tough when those things happen at the holidays.\" Luke nodded in agreement.\n\"I haven't been able to write a note, or a word, or sing since that. Sometimes it . . . I feel so empty.\" Emma felt better for telling him, although her stomach was in knots. She hadn't told anyone about that.\n\"Sometimes,\" Luke said after a while, \"when I go a while without writing, I feel like that. Empty, and worried I might not have more to write about.\"\n\"But you get past it?\"\n\"Yes. So far.\" Luke sighed as they rode a bit further. He guided the horses around the corner, stalling for time. It was his turn to talk, even though he was still processing what Emma had told him.\n\"Luke, you don't have to say anything.\" Emma patted his arm and he wondered if she'd read his mind. \"It was so good of you to listen to all of that and . . . well, you don't have to say anything you don't want to.\"\n\"No, I do.\" He looked down at her. \"That was the deal, remember?\"\n\"No, no.\" He shook his head and gave a small grin. \"I can't go back on my word, especially now. What would Santa think?\"\nShe laughed, a sound that warmed him through and that he wanted to hear again.\n\"I can't say mine is quite as dramatic, but . . . .\" He shrugged. \"I wanted to be a writer. My dad wanted me to be a farmer. I decided I had to follow what I wanted, so I left and they never forgave me.\"\n\"Oh.\" She squeezed his arm. \"I'm so sorry.\"\n\"Not your fault.\" He flicked the reins. \"I call every so often, but I never get anywhere. I think my mom would talk to me but her loyalties are torn so she doesn't.\" He scoffed. \"It's ridiculous, really, since my younger brother is all about the farm. It's in his blood; hell, it's in his DNA. And don't get me wrong, I love it, too, but it's not . . . .\" He searched for the words. \"It's not the right thing for me. Writing is.\"\n\"So here we are, the two of us, alone at Christmas,\" Emma observed.\n\"I guess.\" He gave her a questioning glance. \"What happened with Lila?\"\n\"I don't know.\" Emma shook her head. \"Our father died about two years before we came to the city, and our mom remarried about a year after that. We didn't care for her husband and it was mutual, but we tried to get along. For her sake, you know? Then they moved. Florida. I called once, left a message . . . they never called back.\"\n\"So you don't know where she is?\" Luke was surprised. \"They never called to say she showed up?\"\n\"She might not have gone to them.\" Emma felt her throat tighten up and forced the words out. \"Like I said, we didn't get along. But she never . . . never called me, or anything. We had one cousin, but we weren't close, so I don't think she would have gone there, either. I saw a few people we both knew, but they hadn't heard from her.\" Her voice dropped to a whisper. \"I miss her so much.\"\n\"I'm sure she misses you, too.\" Luke rubbed her shoulder.\nEmma nodded but didn't say anything. She did miss her sister. They weren't twins, but they'd often felt like they were. They finished sentences for each other, picked on up on moods without saying anything . . . they had been best friends.\n\"I hate to say it,\" Luke told her, \"but we have to get back. You probably need to get to work and so do I.\"\n\"I do.\" Emma paused, then bit her lip. \"Will I see you after? At Millie's?\"\n\"You bet.\" Luke turned the horses again and they headed back to their starting point.\n\"You know, I'm always surprised that the horses aren't frightened,\" Emma said, talking over her relief at Luke's answer. \"The cars go speeding by, honking, but the horses just keep going along. They must trust you.\"\n\"They do.\" Luke chuckled. \"Or I like to think they do, but really, it's the blinders. They can't see the cars, so they aren't scared.\"\n\"I wish I could be like that.\" Emma sighed. \"I feel like I'm scared of everything sometimes.\"\nLuke pulled the horses to a stop and turned to her. \"Not me, though, right? You aren't scared of me?\"\nShe shook her head. \"No, I couldn't be.\"\n\"Good.\" Luke cupped her face and kissed her. She feels so soft, so warm. Luke dropped the reins over his knee and put his other arm around her to pull her close. Emma responded with a sigh and gripped his jacket. After a moment, he pulled away. \"Wow.\"\n\"Yeah.\" Emma nodded, then twisted her fingers in her lap. \"I . . . I've never even dated anyone since . . . I wasn't sure anyone would want to once I told them.\"\n\"Don't be silly.\" Luke kissed her again, this time with a little more force. \"I only wish I had more time to kiss you. Think Millie would let someone else take your shift?\"\nEmma giggled. \"I don't think so. She's pretty strict about that.\"\n\"Rats.\" Luke laughed as well and wrapped his arms around her. \"I'd much rather stay here with you than ride around in the cold.\"\n\"I like being with you, too.\" Emma colored after she said it. God, he'll think you're back in high school, she thought.\n\"Good.\" He kissed her once more, taking her by surprise. Her lips were parted and he ran his tongue over them, making her grip him tighter and sending goosebumps racing over her body. \"I think we should find more ways to be together,\" he said, and Emma hoped her answer was apparent in her response to his kiss.\nAfter a few more minutes, Emma pushed herself away with some regret. \"That feels great, but I'm not sure you want Sol catching us doing that.\"\nLuke rolled his eyes. \"He'd probably tell me how I was doing it wrong.\"\n\"Thanks.\" Luke held her again. \"You're right, I hate to go but we better. I will see you later, okay?\"\n\"Right.\" Emma waited until Luke got down from the carriage and held out a hand to help her before she followed suit. She started to step back but he grabbed her hands.\n\"You'll be all right, won't you?\" He rubbed his hands up and down her arms.\n\"I'll be okay.\" Emma nodded.\n\"Good.\" Luke kissed her forehead. \"Christmas is coming and I want to spend it with you.\"\nHer eyes welled up at the words. \"Thank you. I'd like that.\""

                            "text": "\u201cWonder how long it's going to take for word to spread that we're married now,\u201d Inuyasha murmured quietly as they walked, none of the villagers within earshot.\nNodding their heads in return to the few more bows they received from passersby along their way, it didn't take hanyou and miko long to reach the monk and slayer's house. The squealing laughter of happy toddlers at play was the first thing Inuyasha heard as they neared the property, and rather than finding the sound annoying, his eyes softened. He loved those little girls.\nRaising his hand to knock on the doorframe he never got the chance, never made a sound, pausing with his hand raised as both he and Kagome clearly heard the toddlers within the house both stop what they were doing and shout \u201cDoggy!\u201d in unison.\n\u201cThey've definitely got their father's spiritual powers,\u201d she commented proudly.\nThe hanging door mat moved aside then, revealing Sango's smiling face, giggling two-year-olds peaking out from behind her legs on either side.\n\u201cKnock knock,\u201d Kagome said then, in way of greeting.\n\u201cCome in, come in!\u201d Sango answered as she turned and went back in to pick up the suddenly fussing Ichirou, whom she then immediately handed over to Kagome as the miko slipped off her sandals and stepped up onto the raised wooden floor.\n\u201cCan you take him?\u201d she asked after Kagome was already holding the baby, who'd immediately quieted down again in the miko's arms, and then without waiting for an answer Sango turned and scurried back over to the pot of rice she was currently cooking.\nInuyasha laughed at the scene.\nSango looked up from her cooking and quirked a brow.\nSango looked up from her rice at that, and gave the pair a knowing smile.\n\u201cAs well as it went with you and the bouzu,\u201d Inuyasha answered.\n\u201cWhat about Sango and I?\u201d asked Miroku as he entered the hut behind Inuyasha and Kagome just in time to hear the hanyou's statement.\nKagome chuckled at the quip as she had a seat beside Sango, little Ichirou still in her arms, but Miroku didn't have time to react to his wife's comment, his daughters immediately demanding his attention.\n\u201cOtou, Doggy here!\u201d Mizuki stated next, pointing frantically at Inuyasha as if her father hadn't previously noticed the half inu man standing two feet away from him.\n\u201cYes, I can see that,\u201d Miroku answered, humoring the elder twin.\nLeaning his shakujo against the wall, he then slipped off his sandals and stepped up onto the raised wooden floor, picking the still waiting younger twin up before having a seat beside his wife on Sango's other side.\nInuyasha followed suit, stepping up onto the raised wooden floor as well to have a seat next to his own wife while Miroku complemented the smell of Sango's cooking.\n\u201cI said it went as well for us with the headman as it did for you two,\u201d he explained then, grinning and nodding when Miroku looked his way with a curious eye.\nWith Kagome and Inuyasha officially invited to stay for lunch, not that either of them actually needed an invitation, Sango insisted, exclaiming that the two of them were of course welcome at any time, the foursome held off on starting the conversation everyone was eager to have as they sensed little Shippou's approach, knowing the kitsune would feel left out if they didn't wait for him. The fox child had felt it when Kagome and Inuyasha had exited the headman's compound and had excused himself from his friends as quickly as he could. He entered the monk and slayer's house less than a minute later, just as Sango was moving the finished rice away from the fire.\n\u201cFor the rest of my life,\u201d the miko added, not bothering to cover her mouth as she smiled, the expression more genuinely happy rather than amused.\n\u201cDoes this mean what I think it means?\u201d Shippou asked, his expression and tone of voice both genuinely happy as well and not teasing in the slightest, as he met Kagome's eyes rather than Inuyasha's to seek final verification.\nIn reality, Miroku's words were meant to tease not only Shippou, but Inuyasha, as well. He didn't believe for a second that their feisty little future-born miko was suddenly going to become a quiet, obedient wife. Not any more than Sango had. He mentally chuckled at the absurd thought. Sango was anything but quiet and obedient, and he wouldn't have her any other way. Her differences from the customary norm were what had made him fall so deeply in love with her in the first place.\nThree can play at this game... Kagome thought, smirking.\n\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d she asked, in that tone of voice. \u201cOsuwa-!\u201d she shouted, stopping herself before completing the word.\nInuyasha instinctively flinched, genuinely startled, which caused Kagome, Shippou, and Sango to snicker quietly in amusement, while Miroku laughed a bit more heartily.\nInuyasha turned and glared at his wife, but there was no real fire in his eyes.\nHe definitely wasn't pissed. Embarrassed, maybe, but not pissed.\n\u201cI thought it was,\u201d she answered nonchalantly, which earned a chuckle from the hanyou himself that time.\nThe kit beamed at him.\nThe miko laughed despite the heat she could feel rushing to her cheeks, Inuyasha's own deep blush at Shippou's words making her feel more amused than embarrassed, herself. Three years ago she would have admonished the boy for saying such things, but despite his appearance Kagome knew Shippou was actually a lot older than he looked, and even though his appearance wasn't really an illusion because he was still just a child, by youkai standards, there was simply no way a young kitsune boy was going to remain ignorant to the ways of mature adults. Especially when she considered the fact that some of the lessons he was learning in his version of school probably included how to transform into a beautiful woman to seduce unsuspecting men. It was the oldest kitsune trick in the book, and one Miroku had been all too happy to help the other foxes perfect during their impromptu stay at the Kitsune Inn that one time.\nWith everyone settling back down after their moment of fun, Sango was ready to serve up lunch, and after helping the nervous Kagome to carefully tuck the drowsy Ichirou back into his basket cradle, pretty soon the only sounds that could be heard were those of eating. At least until the twins suddenly decided their chopsticks made better toy daggers than eating utensils and Sango had to say a few words to get them to behave and eat properly again. Kagome and Inuyasha only chuckled at the scene.\nOnce lunch was finished, hanyou and miko stayed with their friends for a while longer, Kagome chatting with Sango amiably while the slayer gave Ichirou his own lunch. Kagome was fascinated by the act of breast feeding, and asked Sango what it felt like, earning a grumble from her husband to stop discussing 'girlie' things in his presence, which earned him Kagome sticking her tongue out at him in reply, although they did change the subject. Inuyasha, shaking his head at his wife's antics, started going over the list of things he wanted to get at the market the following day with Miroku, asking the houshi to give him from his stash the amount of money he figured he'd better bring with them. He asked for more money than he honestly thought he needed, having a fairly good grasp of what most things cost from his numerous trips to the market with Miroku, but this would be his first time going to there with Kagome, who was now his wife, and if she just happened to see something, anything, that she ended up wanting, he wanted to be able to buy it for her.\nHe told her as much when she raised an eyebrow at the amount of money Miroku counted out into the pouch he then handed over. She figured a nice quiver might be a bit expensive, but it couldn't be that expensive.\n\u201cIt's not like I'm going to want some fancy necklace or hair comb,\u201d she insisted, flattered but wanting to reassure her new husband that material things weren't really that important to her.\nHe merely shrugged, and she rolled her eyes.\n\u201cWell, I suppose there are some things I'd like to get tomorrow besides a new quiver, so long as you're offering,\u201d she stated then, asking Miroku if she could have a slip of paper to write down a short list.\nInstead of wasting any of the monk's ink for such a trivial thing she asked her new husband to please grab her a charred stick from the firepit with those fireproof hands of his, and he immediately complied, finding her a good one that was about the same size as the pencils he remembered from the future. Kagome used it as such, writing a brief charcoal list of only a few essentials.\nInuyasha observed as she listed only simple, practical things. Some good feathers for fletching, since she'd need to get started on making up some arrows right away.\nA fire steel and a couple of flint stones.\nMakes even more sense. He nodded his approval.\nSome sewing supplies, like needles, a thimble, thread and thread wax, a pair of scissors, plus a good length of some plain, inexpensive fabric, so that she could have something to practice with before cutting into the nicer fabric she'd been given.\n\u201cKeh, done,\u201d he said with a nod, not even hesitating a moment because he knew he had plenty of money to cover the cost of such things.\nSniffing the air, Inuyasha shifted his gaze Sango's way, the taijiya having just laid little Ichirou down after his feeding.\n\u201cAlready?\u201d she asked, with an almost whimsical sigh to her voice, as if she were used to that routine, which Kagome imagined she probably was.\nPicking Ichirou back up, Sango didn't even bother to give her son an experimental sniff herself, trusting the hanyou's nose. Moving over to the cabinet that held his clean diapers, Sango proceeded to undress and change Ichirou. As soon as she got him undone, she made an exaggerated sound and turned to glance Inuyasha's way over her shoulder. \u201cYou weren't kidding!\u201d she joked as she got to work.\nInuyasha and Miroku both chuckled, while Kagome cocked her head to the side and gave her husband a curious glance.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, his tone of voice still mirthful.\nInuyasha gave her a funny look at that, and then chuckled again, shaking his head some in amusement.\nEven Kagome had to laugh at that one.\nInuyasha opened his mouth to say more, but it was in that moment that his ears suddenly turned to face the door, before flattening against his head, a mildly irritated expression appearing on his face.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Kagome asked, but before he could answer there was a light rapping on the doorframe.\n\u201cNeighbors,\u201d he grumbled quietly then, as Miroku got up to answer the door while Sango sent the hanyou a sheepish, apologetic look.\nThe neighbors gushed their greetings as Miroku bid them entry, bowing to both he and Sango, and then, remaining in the beaten earth entryway, they bowed humbly in the bemused hanyou and miko's direction.\n\u201cOh, Inuyasha-sama, Kagome-sama, we heard the fabulous news and wanted to congratulate you both on your union right away!\u201d the woman stated, her husband adding, \u201cAnd rest assured, my lord, the men will be gathered quickly to begin work on your house. We can start as early as tomorrow morning, should you wish it.\u201d They both bowed deeply a second time.\nKagome could hear Inuyasha's quiet sigh, only because she was sitting so close to him, and then almost as if he'd slipped a mask in place, he rose regally to his feet before nodding his head back at both of them.\nNodding their understanding and bowing again, Sango and Miroku's neighbors then quickly excused themselves, practically scurrying out of the hut. Kagome waited a few seconds before speaking, until she was certain they were out of earshot.\n\u201cWow...you're good at that,\u201d she complemented then, as he plopped back down on the floor beside her.\nHe gestured with a wave in Miroku's direction, and the monk pretended to look offended at the accusation.\n\u201cI am certain I do not know what you mean,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAnd I'm certain you do,\u201d Sango chimed in, sending her husband a knowing look of her own as she put the changed and redressed Ichirou back to bed.\nInuyasha, Kagome and Shippou all laughed.\nWith it being about time to excuse themselves, the twins looking like they could use a nap and little Ichirou already asleep, hanyou and miko bid their friends a good rest of their day in that moment, promising that they'd be by first thing in the morning to collect Miroku so that the trio could walk to the market together.\nHeading back to Kaede's house, finally, the future-born miko shared the good news about her and Inuyasha's marriage with Kaede and Rin, and they both congratulated the pair as well, even though they'd both already known that morning what the purpose of their visit to the headman's house had been. That, and to begin the process of procuring a home for themselves. Kaede also agreed that in the forest near the well and Goshinboku was the most ideal location for their house, once she heard it, even going so far as to suggest that this would be the first of many steps that would ultimately lead to that location becoming the spot for Kagome's family's home and shrine five hundred years into the future.\nKagome immediately agreed, of course, stating how it stood to reason that eventually, when the time came, a shrine being built in that location to honor the presence of her and Inuyasha made perfect sense. Said hanyou didn't really want to think about a future time when all that might be left of his wife was a shrine built by the villagers in her honor, though, and so he quickly changed the subject, asking Kaede if there was anything she wanted them to pick up for her in the morning.\nKaede nodded her understanding, as she went through her various containers of herbs, preparing to make a medicine she really did need for somebody in the village that time. It wasn't another ruse to give Inuyasha and Kagome an excuse to leave together again, and in fact the herbs would not be offensive to his nose, she assured him, as she caught him eyeing her preparing the ingredients.\n\u201cCan I do it, Kaede-baa-chan?\u201d Kagome asked then, eager to learn all that she could.\nGlancing Inuyasha's way nervously after she spoke, worried he might've had other plans, he gave his new wife a reassuring smile that silently told her to go ahead and let Kaede show her how to make that medicine. Kagome grinned his way in reply, her eyes thankful, and she then proceeded to listen to everything Kaede had to tell her.\nInuyasha observed as Kaede prattled on about what purposes the various herbs used in that medicine had and how much was needed, his own smile never wavering. He was still living off the glow from the previous evening's activities, so he didn't need to greedily keep Kagome all to himself for a second evening in a row. Besides, he wasn't 100% sure he trusted himself to be that alone with her again, at least until their house was built. The fact that she was his wife now, and he could rightfully\u2026 Well, his right or not she still deserved better than to be taken out in the forest like an animal. He was an animal, or half, at least, and that was bad enough.\nHe was still worried about how she would react to learning about his other inhuman features, although he was trying to take her confident reassurances to heart that his youkai half didn't bother her in the slightest, even when it came to matters of the bedroom. He hoped that that was true, since there was nothing he could do about that part if it wasn't, but he could at least promise her a roof and a bed for those activities, instead of throwing his inhumanity in her face by using the wild forest as their bedroom. It was the least he could do. Just because he was half dog didn't mean he had to rut her in the dirt like the dog he was. In this, he would focus on his human half, and resist his youkai instincts. He could survive off the high of simply knowing that she was his wife until their house was finally built, and hopefully by that time he'd have finally gotten over the rest of his insecurities as well. It was probably something the two of them needed to discuss openly, he realized, but not right away. He'd have to muscle up the courage for that too, first.\nOf course, if Kagome had any say in the matter, she'd get him to realize that she did not require a roof, or a bed. All she needed was Inuyasha. In that moment the future-born miko was doing her best to actually pay attention to Kaede's lesson, though, unaware of the true severity of her new husband's inner turmoil. She wanted to learn herbs, after all, and she was doing her best to commit her sensei's words to memory. But it had not escaped her comprehension that Inuyasha and she were husband and wife, now, and all that that entailed.\nShe of course would never dream of actually doing anything with Kaede and Rin in the same room; she wasn't that much of a harlot. In her mind, that was what the privacy of the forest was for. So that was something she'd have to work on with her husband. In the meantime, though, when it came to their actual sleeping arrangements at night, Kagome had been telling the truth before when she'd told Inuyasha that she was certain Kaede would not mind it if they simply lied next to one another, and if he was too embarrassed to have witnesses then she was also sure they could use the changing screen to partition off a private corner of the room for themselves, to preserve modesty. He'd chickened out the night before, so she suspected Kaede and Rin baring witness was a good part of it. He no longer had the added excuse of them not technically being married yet. If he thought he was still going to sleep upright against that blasted wall of his, he had another think coming!\nStill, Kagome knew she should rightfully ask Kaede her permission, first, since it was the elderly miko's home and she did not want to risk possibly offending her new sensei. She didn't honestly think it would offend Kaede, or she wouldn't even bring it up and leave Inuyasha to his wall, figuring better safe than sorry, but she knew Kaede well enough by that point to know what she could and couldn't ask the elderly miko without pushing boundaries.\nShe also knew what she could and couldn't ask in front of Inuyasha without it embarrassing her poor hanyou to high heavens, and asking Kaede with him sitting right there if it was all right with her if they snuggled would be too much for the inu-hanyou, she was sure. She'd be lucky if he didn't end up spending the night up on Kaede's roof. But Kagome had the perfect solution for that little hiccup, and would implement her plan at the appropriate opportunity, after her current lesson on herbal medicine had come to a close.\nThat opportunity came not too much later, as Kaede packaged up the finished product and asked Rin to please go deliver it for her. The eleven-year-old, once again dressed in her usual yukata, immediately complied to Kaede's wishes, putting down her new sewing project to run her errand for her. She was happy to help, knowing the elderly miko couldn't move as fast as her and that this was only a quick delivery of the medicine the people were already expecting and already knew how to use. It would only take her a few minutes. Promising she'd be right back as she grabbed the jar of medicine, she dashed out the door.\nKaede put a pot of water on to boil, then, while asking Kagome if she wouldn't mind washing the rice for her. Smiling sincerely, grateful to help in any way she could, Kagome immediately began washing the rice, and then turned to glance Inuyasha's way while in the middle of her task, putting her plan into motion.\n\u201cInuyasha?\u201d she began, immediately earning his attention.\n\u201cHmm?\u201d he asked from his place against the wall, watching her work with a lazy, stupid grin.\nShe grinned as well at the sight, realizing he was probably even happier about their marriage than she was, which she hadn't previously thought would be possible, but considering the life she'd had growing up versus the life he'd had, she couldn't blame him. Had she never been able to return to the past, she could have theoretically gotten over him and fallen in love with another man, she knew. Theoretically, at least, even though it would have never actually happened. But for Inuyasha, if it weren't for her return, he'd have had nobody; no potential love interests whatsoever, theoretical or otherwise. It wasn't fair, and it wasn't right, but she understood it was the truth. She'd spent her days as a little girl daydreaming about having a fancy wedding, about what kind of man she was going to marry, but Inuyasha, he'd spent his days as a little boy being told he was a worthless abomination by everyone but his mother, with nobody even willing to be his friend, let alone a potential girlfriend, and by the time he'd reached potential girlfriend age he'd been too busy trying to stay alive in the wild forests to worry about something as unrealistic, in his mind, as one day having a love to call his own.\nWhile she'd given up her once-dream of a fanciful wedding ceremony, she didn't honestly care, having married the love of her life, and she couldn't be happier, but knowing that he had also married the love of his life, and that he was still trying to wrap his head around the fact that the woman he loved even loved him in return, Kagome found herself feeling even more happy for her husband than she was for herself. She had literally made his dreams come true by returning to him, and he'd already told her to her face that he'd do his best to give her whatever she wanted, whatever she asked of him. It was a little cruel to take advantage of that to send him out of the house in that moment, but ultimately it was for his own good, anyway, and besides, she wasn't lying.\nHe was on his feet in an instant, the look in his eyes determined, and not the least bit put out. She'd struck a nerve with his inu-youkai side; his mate was asking for meat and he would provide it for her.\nAnd she actually really did want it; she hoped his hunt would be successful.\n\u201cI won't be long,\u201d was all he said, and grabbing Tetsusaiga, he was out the door.\n\u201cWell, then I better make this fast,\u201d Kagome mumbled to herself, sending an amused glance Kaede's way when the elderly miko raised an eyebrow at Kagome at her words.\n\u201cSomething you wished to say in private?\u201d the older miko inquired.\nKagome didn't hesitate to launch into her request, promising Kaede that she had no intention of scandalizing her and Rin with 'marital activities' from behind the screen, but that she wanted only to be able to sleep lying beside her husband, for Inuyasha to feel comfortable enough to hold her in his arms as he'd already told her he longed to do.\nKaede, as predicted, waved off Kagome's concern, assuring the younger miko that of course it was all right for her to share a private corner with her husband for such purposes, stating that Miroku and Sango had also done the same during the time it'd taken for their own house to be constructed.\nKagome relaxed at Kaede's reassurances, smiling appreciatively. She'd known of course that Miroku and Sango had stayed with her until their house was finished, but the little detail of whether or not they'd all still slept together in the one big open room like during the quest days, or if Miroku and Sango had used the screen for some semblance of privacy, had never come up. Kagome alsoknew that those two had also engaged in 'marital activities' prior to the completion of their house, having learned that bit of information during her lunch with them the day of the feast, when Inuyasha had been out hunting down that deer. Miroku had quite shamelessly boasted how he hadn't been able to wait even one more day on marrying Sango after the battle was won, hence why they'd gone to the headman right away to record it, just like she and Inuyasha had done that morning, and since they'd obviously not yet had a house to call their own, either, Miroku had said that he and Sango had taken off for the market village straight afterwards, even though it wasn't Market Day, because that village, much more a town than their own humble village, possessed a proper inn.\nAt that time, Kagome still hadn't known where she and Inuyasha stood, not having yet had their chance to sort everything out. In fact it'd been before their misunderstanding in the first place. Then as soon as Inuyasha'd come back, getting his wrong ideas from her wearing the miko robes, it'd been non-stop public relations until their night at Haruto's house had come to a close. The next day, once they'd finally gotten everything out in the open and had had their lovely evening together, bringing up the fact that they could go to the inn when Inuyasha had mentioned that she deserved better than the forest honestly just hadn't crossed her mind.\nThinking about it in that moment, though, as she put the cleaned rice on to cook, Kagome knew it was much too late to head to the market village now, and besides, tomorrow was Market Day and so they'd be there, anyway. Maybe, if she played her cards right, Miroku would be making the walk back home alone.\nOn the other hand, if a room would cost too much money she wouldn't worry about it, and Inuyasha might also feel weird about it, knowing how most villages other than their own tended to look at him. She didn't have his ears, but she wasn't deaf, and there had been plenty of times throughout the shard hunt where she'd heard the various whispers, people wondering why 'those people' \u2013 meaning her, Sango and Miroku \u2013 were traveling with 'that creature' \u2013 meaning Inuyasha. She'd been on the receiving end of some nasty whispers a few times, too. Even though she'd been a stubborn thing back then, and had insisted on wearing her school uniform for the principle of the thing, because she wasn't going to let other people tell her what she could or couldn't wear, she wasn't stupid, and she'd known how a skirt that short was viewed by most people in the century she now called home. Realizing in that moment that getting a room at the inn could either be an awesome idea, or a horrible one, she wouldn't try to be slick about it. She'd ask Inuyasha outright if he wanted to. It was the best way to know his thoughts on the matter, after all. Might be a little more brazen than he was expecting, but she was almost nineteen years old, and she was his wife; she had a right to be brazen, and more importantly than that, saying things outright would prevent any future misunderstandings. They'd had enough of those to last them a lifetime.\nIt was that mind-set that gave her the confidence to stick to her guns later that night, after dinner was through. Inuyasha had successfully caught a rabbit, of course, returning with it already skinned and gutted, and while Kaede'd tended to the vegetables Kagome had chopped up the rabbit meat, cooking it in a separate pan. Kaede had politely declined having any of the rabbit meat for herself, but when Rin had asked if she could have some Inuyasha had given Kagome a curt nod at her questioning glance. There had been plenty to spare; it'd been a fairly large rabbit.\nDinner was delicious, and now, with Kaede and Rin already ready for bed and settling into their places by the firepit, Inuyasha sitting up against the wall as per usual, Kagome knew it was time to act. First, she ducked behind the changing screen while leaving the screen in its customary location, stripping out of her yukata and into her pajamas. Then, she went over to the other corner that housed the storage chest that had been dedicated to hold her things, and retrieved her sleeping bag. So far, it was the same routine. She changed that routine up, however, by laying her sleeping bag down much closer to the storage chest than she'd done before, having previously brought her bag further out into the center of the room, closer to the fire, like the others.\nShe turned her head to look right at him, and smirked, the opportunity way too good to pass up.\n\u201cWell then you're just going to have to keep me warm,\u201d she answered, making sure to keep her words a very quiet whisper so that he wouldn't feel the added embarrassment from fearing that either Kaede or Rin had overheard her.\nShe then proceeded to grab the screen from its corner and bring it over to where she was, setting it up between herself and the fire, which also meant, of course, that she was now completely cut off from the two people lying down on the other side of the fire. From his place against the side wall Inuyasha could still partly see behind the screen, seeing part of her movement as she settled herself down into her sleeping bag, but it was obvious to him that she hadn't been intending to block even half of his view of her. No, it was beyond obvious to him what she had actually just done, remembering how Sango and Miroku had done the same thing. He felt his cheeks flaming at the thought, but that didn't stop him from slowly, very slowly, getting up and heading over in her direction.\nSetting Tetsusaiga down by her bow, he knelt down next to her as she propped herself up on an elbow to look at him in the darkness, their private little corner by the storage chest in shadow thanks to the screen blocking the direct light from the fire.\n\u201cWe are married now, aren't we?\u201d he asked with an edge of wonder in his voice, as if realizing himself that he was out of excuses for staying against the wall. The look in his eyes told her he was glad to be out of excuses.\nHe didn't reply verbally, but something in his eyes changed at her words, his gaze smoldering, almost burning right through her. It was a look not of sexual desire, but of desire as a whole, in its truest form. He remained silent as he reached for the edge of her sleeping bag, and scooting back to give him room, Kagome welcomed her husband with open arms as Inuyasha wordlessly joined her within the polyester cocoon. He whispered quietly then for her to turn around, and she immediately did so, and he didn't hesitate to tuck himself fully against her, pulling her in close as he spooned her from behind, burying his nose in her hair and inhaling deeply.\nIt occurred to him vaguely in the back of his mind that his sense of smell was pretty much out of commission all of a sudden, since all he could focus on was her. His ears, too, seemed to home in exclusively on the sound of her breathing, the rhythm of her heartbeat. It was potentially dangerous to sleep like this, he realized in that moment, since he was pretty much useless when it came to sensing any approaching threats, but he also knew that Kagome's unlocked spiritual powers could sense an encroaching demonic aura from miles away, and the realization that he was relying on his wife for protection in his distracted state didn't bother him in the slightest. He was proud of Kagome and her spiritual powers, and he trusted her with his life. It'd taken him a while to admit it, even to himself, but he'd entrusted her with not only his life, but also his heart, long before the defeat of Naraku. Now, on that night, in that moment, he had Kagome in his arms, his wife, his mate, and nothing else mattered. And although they hadn't actuallymated yet he knew that too would come soon enough, as soon as their house was finished. He'd waited this long for her; he could wait another month or so until constructed was completed. It wasn't that big of a deal.\nIn the meantime, though, he was never sleeping sitting up against that wall ever again."

                            "text": "Avarice didn't believe his feigned innocence for a moment, and only gave a sly smirk of her own when he did his innocent whistle. She didn't think much of her physical appearance. Her breasts were small and the rest of her body was extremely thin with little curves to speak of. Whenever she was lonely and wanted company for a night, though, she never had much trouble finding a volunteer. Maybe she wasn't as underwhelming as she'd thought?\nGetting back to business, she shook the thoughts that plagued her away. Wrath did know the lady from the bookstore, it seemed. Of course. The sign of recognition was clear and Avarice rarely doubted her eyes.\n\"You two sound close.\" Avarice said rather dryly. \"Asking Avarice why she wants something is a rather moot concept, don't you think? I want it because it exists and I want everything that has that quality.\"\nThen he made an interesting offer, grinning at her. \"Another sword? Tell me about it, then.\"\nHe appreciated that smirk she made. Honor among thieves, supposedly. She said that he and Alice sounded close, and that asking her why she wanted something was useless. He chuckled. \"I had a feeling you might say that. Why would that mean we're close? I don't have anything like that. She's a good asset. Nothing more.\"\nShe then asked him about the sword, and a smirk of his own built on his face. \"You want Excalibur, but that's a hallowed blade. I know you want it. But a blade as holy as Excalibur, touched, and corrupted by evil...I think that's much more up your alley. And I think it a much better gift for you.\"\n\"So you know of Excalibur, but do you know anything of the Arthurian Mythos?\" Maybe she'd get annoyed of explanation. But that was how you sold someone something.\nAvarice's attempt at dry sarcasm seemed to go unnoticed by Wrath. The way the male Sin described it, it sounded like he and Alice hardly knew each other. Maybe he got defensive about it because there was something more there? If he was a human, Avarice would be convinced of this... but he's not, so she took him at his word that Alice was just an asset. Not that it mattered much.\n\"Are you trying to say you think me evil?\" She asked with a coy smile, sitting on the fanciest looking chair in the room. \"I don't think that either of us can really be evil or not. We just exist... but I'm not in the middle of a morality crisis. An evil version of Excalibur does sound like the kind of toy I'd love to get my hands on.\"\nHe wanted to quiz her on her knowledge of Arthurian Mythos, and as he expected she was already tired of the history lesson. \"I know enough. Somehow I feel like you're about to enlighten me, though.\"\nHe chuckled again gently as she asked if he thought of her as evil, and she said that to her, neither of them were evil. That they just existed. But then she went ahead and said that an evil Excalibur would be in her interest.\nWhen he asked how much she knew about Arthur's legacy, she said she knew enough, and expressed a bit of disdain at how he was setting up to explain it. He smiled wryly.\n\"Relax. I'm not a history professor. I'll keep it short. Just don't regret it if you ask for details.\"\n\"Since I'm keeping it simple, Excalibur was a holy blade of Avalon given to Arthur by one Lady in the Lake. It was said it was returned to the lake. While I have some very good leads, there is one blade I can give you with absolute certainty. A sword used with holy intentions that was corrupted and made evil.\"\n\"Clarent was actually a sword of Arthur's, his peace sword; which he used to make his knights. But it was stolen for his son, Mordred- won't get into that- which he then slew Arthur with at the end of the tale. Stained with holy blood it is an evil blade whose name is for all intents and purposes blasphemy in the magic community. Would you be interested in that?\"\nAvarice was rarely one for settling, and generally stubborn in her pursuits of things that she wanted. That being said, Excalibur was already proving to be something that would take a lot of patience and time for her to get. She was willing to devote these things, but the consolation of another sword with such a fierce reputation would also be greatly appreciated.\n\"I want it.\" She declared simply. This sword, less renowned and powerful than Excalibur, she figured she would have much less trouble finding. \"I assume that there is some kind of a payment you're looking for, though? Sins aren't really known for their polite and giving nature. Tell me, Acrimonious, what's in it for you?\"\nShe sat on the couch that welcomed guests, crossing her legs like a highborn lady. Her arms crossed as well, just under her breasts as she waited for her 'sibling' to give an answer to the inquiry.\nFear couldn't help but smile wryly when she simply said she wanted after he told her about it. It gave him some pride, really, though it made him wonder if succeeding in working out a deal with Greed was winning with or against a handicap. It was then, however, that Avarice started asking what he wanted in return, since Sins weren't usually polite and giving.\nShocking. She might realize he had a very playful nature from that.\nAvarice wasn't fool enough to think that Wrath's body language was anything less than deliberate. She wondered if he realized that she'd changed into her outfit with a deliberate intention in mind too. A silk nightgown that she changed into right in front of him? Men were usually easier to negotiate with when they were thinking with their other head, in her experience. Judging by his body language, Wrath was no exception.\nOnly he was full of surprises.\nA favor? Avarice smirked at the idea.\n\"Vague promises of future payment are my favorite kind. I accept your terms. We'll begin the search tomorrow morning, then.\"\nShe would stand again, walking over to him and looping her arm with his.\n\"If you could show me to the bedroom?\"\nHe chuckled lightly as she smirked when he stated his price. She said that vague future payments were her favorite, and said that they would begin the search tomorrow. \"I figured they might be. After all, a favor can be absolutely anything. What better payment for the likes of Avarice?\"\nShe stood and came over, looping her arm with his. He quirked a brow with that same wry smile on his face. He stood as she asked him to show her to the bedroom. He walked with graceful steps, showing her throughout the house. \"I'm sure Avarice would want only the finest room. So, you can have whichever you want. I get the funny feeling though...\"\nHe showed her each room as they walked. He'd stop if she pointed one out. They were all fairly decorated. But of course, his had more of a personality.\n...that it might be mine.\nHis was at the end of the hall. He was fairly certain she'd pick it, but who knew? He wasn't the only one full of surprises.\nThe sitting down and standing up added with the new idea of moving through the house, reminded Avarice of how much she had drank earlier. She didn't show it in her surprisingly light and quick steps, but she could feel the alcohol changing her perception a bit. Nothing she wasn't already used to, though.\nAs they passed through the house, Avarice impassively looked over the rooms. None were particularly trashy, but they were all definitely beneath the standards that she usually employed in her life. All except for one.\nIt wasn't much better than the others, really... but she could tell things about it immediately. It was Wrath's room. That gave it inherit value. Taking something that was up for grabs was one thing, but taking something from someone was a completely different story.\n\"This one.\" She said simply, walking in by herself and looking around as though she owned it. She'd touch things without permission, open drawers... it was like she was determining the value of it's contents in a quick sweep. \"Yes, this will do. Definitely.\"\nHe chuckled lightly. She was passing off the other rooms without much of a glance, even. So it was small surprise when she confidently walked into his room, saying that she wanted to stay in it. He followed her in, watching her look at his things. He didn't seem particularly interested in stopping her. After all, logic followed that if you wanted something kept secret, why would you keep it near you?\n\"Well, I'm glad it's to your liking, Avarice. Shall I understand you intend to take my bed from me, then? After all, I doubt Avarice is much into sharing...\" He smiled wryly.\nAvarice was correct in her deduction that it was his room. She had no doubts, but verbal confirmation was something she could appreciate. When he asked if she intended to steal his bed, she tried her best to look innocent. \"Oh? This is your room? I couldn't tell.\"\nThe lie was weak, and the sly grin that accompanied it was rather telling.\n\"You're right. Sharing isn't really in my nature...\" She started, then looked back to him. Her eyes looked him up and down as she licked her lips, \"but tonight has been full of surprises. I might be able to make an exception, if you'd like?\"\nThe implication was clear in the air.\nHe couldn't stifle the chuckle that came out when she said that she couldn't tell it was his room. Obviously an intended and transparent lie. He grinned at her. He was starting to like her. They had much the same way of going about things. But then something rather interesting happened. As she started confirming his suspicions, she looked him over, and licked her lips. Something he couldn't help but notice as she said she might be able to make an exception.\nHe smiled wryly again, taking off his shirt and revealing his built frame as he smirked at her.\n\"I think I would like.\"\nWrath was quick to accept the offer, even taking off his shirt. She let loose a giggle at the sight, stepping back to the bed and falling on it. The silk nightgown left little to imagination for the other Sin, but the coy smirk she wore would leave him wondering about possibilities.\n\"Then I think we have ourselves an exception.\""

Or as I like to call them caffeine fueled information regurgitation sessions (sorry that sounds a lot grosser than intended). Anyways, like most of you finals are not a foreign concept to me seeing as the we have been subjected to standardized testing from what feels like infancy, yet there seems to be an added level of stress and anxiety that goes a long with finals in grad school. For example, back in the good old days finals use to live up to there name, they where a final stopping point, after you where finally finished with your finals you could forgo future endeavors in that field (now say that five times fast). However in grad school your learn that even when your finals end that doesn't mean you necessarily given the luxury of taking a breath. For example, this semester I have 2 written finals and a final project, not bad right? But add on fieldwork that needs to get done before the holidays, gather field helpers before they all jump ship for the holidays, find new field helpers when they inventively do jump ship, guilt filled phone calls from your mother describing the Christmas cookies she wishes you were home to help her make, and cramming for those caffeine fueled information regurgitation sessions becomes even less appealing. However with that light at the end of the tunnel, a full cup of coffee in my hand and my new found finals theme song (go ahead and press play again, I know you want to) I will take these next couple weeks in stride, crushing those last few test and presentations, doing the fieldwork of 5 full grown men, and earning the heck out of those Christmas cookies. Happy Finals season to you and yours."

Her balance was bad enough without taking her most reliable sense out of the equation and even if she were to stay laying down the entire time she still had never trusted anyone enough to let them blindfold her.\nEven as a child she hated playing games where she would have to keep her eyes closed. She always peeked. So it surprised her how much she had enjoyed being blindfolded by Sir. Being robbed of her sight seemed to make her other senses much more keen. Sounds and smells were clear and sharp. And trying to guess where he would touch her next was beyond exciting. It drove her wild. Each time he stopped touching her and walked around the room mysteriously she anticipated where she would feel him next. It might be something sweet and slow like the warmth of his breath near her hips\u2026 Or it may be something sharp and short; the sting of his palm against her behind. At it seemed that whatever it was she was anticipating, the opposite would happen.\nBefore he left she\u2019d listened to every move he made, picturing it all behind the soft satin of the blindfold. She\u2019d heard the rustle of fabric. The zip of his jeans. His belt being buckled. The clip of his watch being fastened to his wrist. She\u2019d listened as he gathered his belongings - saying not a single word to her - and strode heavily toward the door. She followed each step he made through sound alone; the tiny crunch of short pile carpet and the gentlest tremble of the floorboards beneath it. Then the short metal thud as he unlocked the door and the gentle whine of opening. Before he left he\u2019d called over to her."

She looked up as the air around her got heavy. That was when he walked in. She didn\u2019t know him. She had never seen him before, and she never knew his name.

Why did she feel as if she had spent a lifetime already with him when she had never before today seen his face?\nShe stole glances at him while he developed his own pictures.

The moment was gone forever and she felt empty of breath and lost. As if she was suddenly grieved over the death of something that she had never really had. But it felt so real, so painful and all at once those moments that had just past before her eyes began to fade.\nThis is actually a true story. It\u2019s not fiction. I had this moment happened to me when I was in college, developing my own images in the dark room. A mysterious gentleman came in on a weekend when the lab was empty. I had never seen him before. I spent enough time using the lab and assignments as an escape from my real life, that I knew most of the students and staff. Though in that moment, I felt as if I had known him for a lifetime. His face and the way that he sounded with his simple greeting and the simple goodbye. I lived a lifetime with him in that quiet hour in the lab. One that wasn\u2019t real but was full of an entire life of emotions. Happiness, love, passion, sadness, loss and death.\nThen all at once, the same way it started, it ended and faded.\nThere are moments on this earth that we can\u2019t define. They are supernatural in nature and we can never truly explain what happened. Maybe I have an overactive imagination, perhaps my love starved self created this moment in my head. I will never know."

And moments after the old year exited in an explosion of fireworks, the new one settled around us like a thick blanket.\nThis is the season of quiet. Of footsteps muffled by snow. Nature pushes us indoors to cocoon through winter\u2019s harshest days as we think and worry and dream.\nFor this month, we've chosen three scents to accompany us through this season of quiet as we prepare to emerge into a new year.\nLightscape, by Ulrich Lang New York, explores the interplay between the bold freshness of galbanum and Sicilian lemon against the delicate refinement of violet. At first spray, it's a bright blast of fresh, sunny citrus and crisp, bitter greens, softening when the violet-iris heart emerges. Lang's love of perfumery is intertwined with his love of modern photography, as you'll see when we talk to him about some of his collaborations with photographers.\nField Notes from Paris, by Ineke, is one of this artists' most beloved works. And we're pretty sure that you'll know why when you smell it. It's a a woody oriental with fresh top notes of citrus and spicy coriander, a floral and tobacco heart, and a rich, warm, woody dry down. G ourmand but never too sweet, sophisticated but casual, beloved by male and female fans alike. There's nothing quite like Field Notes from Paris, which must be why it captures so many fans on first sniff.\nViolette Fum\u00e9e, by Mona di Orio, shows a side of violet that we don't often see: sultry, smoky, and mysterious. Ms. di Orio composed this personal scent for her partner, Jeroen Oude Sogtoen, the creative director of Maison Mona di Orio, over two years. After Mona's untimely passing, Jeroen decided to release this scent to the world, and we're glad he did. Violette Fum\u00e9e is a soft, sweet symphony of violet, rose, pipe tobacco, and myrrh. It is, Jeroen says, \" a creation that holds echoes of my dreams, emotions, colors, sounds, favorite fabrics, favorite movies, and music.\"\nWe wish you all the happiest of new years. We wish you health, love, and a heightened appreciation for the beautiful things in the world around you: the smells, the sights, the sounds, and the textures that make this life such a treasure."

The cacophony that's entered my life and now is a marker, for me, of its completeness.\nWe talk as a family. We talk a lot. We talk perhaps more than we should. We chat continuously.\nThere are moments of silence though. Moments of contemplation. Moments when we, ideally, turn inwards to contemplate our own thoughts.\nIf our children are around we are rarely allowed to do so.\nWhen we were first approached about adopting our son the situation, and fear, expressed by the social workers was very different.\nIn that artificial, false conversation where possibilities are hinted at. The language entirely in the conditional tense. Identifying information deliberately avoided. We were warned there was a fear the little boy who would become our son might have speech delay.\n\"What does that mean?\" I remember asking his social worker.\nShe replied that the reports of both social workers and foster parents concurred. He spoke little. Remained silent for long periods.\nAs a consequence there was a fear he was already behind his peers with his oral communication. Speech therapy was mentioned. Sources of additional help were we to adopt him considered.\nWe met our son briefly some weeks before we began his transition. The full story is here.\nIntroduced as friends of his social worker he seemed to warm to us immediately. He was lively. Smiled. Laughed. And chatted.\nWe went through the week of transition. He was similar. He chatted. He laughed. He shouted. He squealed with delight as we played snowballs during that cold January week.\nAs the weeks went on our son grew even more talkative. A constant stream spilling from his lips. He described whatever he was doing. When we were there this would often take the form of a questioning commentary about the world around him.\nWhen we were not he still provided a monologue. A lonely, engaged, charming soliloquy.\nSometimes he provided himself with instruction. Sometimes the discourse was confirmatory. And occasionally, at its most heartrending it provided vocal reassurance.\n\"I'm with my new family forever. They will love me forever. They'll take care of me and make sure I'm safe.\"\nComing from the lips of a three year old, unaware we were a hidden audience, these words provided both reassurance our messages of permanence and attachment had been heard and a heartbreaking reminder of past terrors.\nOver the intervening years I have been lucky enough to come across many of the professionals who have helped our children through their journey to adoption.\nI've sought information from these people. Asking their opinion. Probing their memories. Obtaining a first hand impression that will, I hope,, enable me to place flesh on the stark, factual bones of our children's pre adoption lives as described in the reports put before the Courts and Adoption Panel.\nI want to be able to add texture to those reports when, inevitably, the children ask about those days.\nAnd so, some time ago, I came across one of the professionals who had been present in those final days when our son's birth family imploded. When the decision to remove him was enacted. When anger and violence spilled forth around him with such vehemence he was removed to safety as an emergency measure.\nThis person described a child who was utterly silent. Silent, in their opinion, through fear. Fear that to make a sound would bring the brutality and cruelty he witnessed to bear on himself.\nSo we encourage our children to talk. We want them to chat.\nAs I sit writing this our daughter is in the kitchen with me, conducting a lesson for her dolls and teddy bear. Providing not only instruction for her toys, but also her own audio description of her actions.\nLong may that continue. Long may sounds and speech spill forth. We might be a noisy family.\nBut we are one where no one will never, ever, be frightened to make a sound."

She pinched the bridge of her nose. \u201cCheck again.\u201d Every researcher scrambled to the post, to their assigned equipment, but Marina knew they would only find that the initial reading were correct. She had helped develop the equipment, after all.\nThe submarine\u2019s crew swirled in a hurricane of confusion and panic, but captain Marina stood centered, an exasperated eye in the storm. She kept her hands pressed firmly to her sides to avoid biting her nails. It was a terrible habit she had picked up recently that she fully intended to kick once she got back home.\nThe ship hasn\u2019t taken the pressure for the last 4 kilometers, Marina restrained herself from saying. She made a show of checking dials and flashing screens to see what to do. She let the show carry on longer than it needed to.\n\u201cYup,\u201d she said in the too casual tone that came from nerves. \u201cWe\u2019ll stop here.\u201d The order trickled out from Marina\u2019s soft voice to gruff shouts from one human to another until the propellers shut down. The biggest sub to ever dare the Challenger Deep drifted to a stop 4 kilometers below the ocean\u2019s lowest point.\n\u201cLights,\u201d Captain Marina commanded. The flood lamps flashed on, no doubt scattering anything that had eyes. Marina slipped her way through all the people still too enamored with barometers to care about what might have been visible on the world\u2019s biggest desert. Marina stared with eyes well adjusted to the darkness and saw the last swirls of water that told her they were here.\n\u201cOh, certainly,\u201d Marina stepped away from the tiny porthole and made her face look thoughtful. She was so close , she could feel the pull again. She tugged at her sleeves. Just a little longer, she begged. Be patient. Marina sat down in the nearest vacant seat. Her pants were starting to feel restrictive.\nWell, that was just too perfect. Marina smirked. She relaxed, just a bit.\nThe submarine exploded in chaos . Alarms blared, red lights flared, and everyone started shouting. The submarine\u2019s integrity started failing. Humans scrambled around, desperately trying to restart the engine and try to ascend.\n\u201cI try,\u201d Marina confessed, a moment before she stopped trying. The alarms had a few seconds to overload before the portholes shattered. There was another moment for screaming, then the rest of the submarine crumpled. She let the water rush in around her, pulling, pulling through her hair and ripping the uniform off her body.\nHer sisters swirled around, picking off the spoils of her decade long hunt. She felt the power of the ocean around her again.\nA friends of mine gave me the prompt that is the first line. The story simply developed from there. I only hope people enjoy reading this story, there's not too much of a deeper meaning."

It took me by surprise. I wasn\u2019t aware that she would care, but clearly she did. The work began when Martha was 16 years of age, a time when a child is on that cusp of being and becoming a woman. It\u2019s a particular period of time, when for a brief period you are both a young woman and child in the same body, before the child leaves and the young woman stands on her own to meet the world.\nIt\u2019s a complex and potentially confusing time. During this period of transition, there is a very short human space when a person can behave free of the weight of societal expectations and norms. Before long that window closes and we can easily forget how it felt to be \u2018untethered\u2019.\nBut the work is also, inevitably, about Martha and myself. I am always there as the photographer, as her step-mother, mentor and friend, but where I am and where I place myself become a more questioning issue as she grows and moves further away from her childhood. The exchange of looks between us, that complex reflected gaze, begins to shift as she tries to define her own sense of self, to decide who she is becoming.\nThough it is through the process of working together in this series so far, we have journeyed into each others psychological landscapes as we explore what our relationship means. We both mirror each others maternal wounding, both our mothers loved us but were felt as absent, this became the common ground to move forward from.\nAnd then there is the young woman shaping herself as a social being. Her group of friends are a safeguard, a source of protection as she moves into this new world. But this new family is also a new learning ground where she first begins to make sense of how she understands the psychological and existential territories of intimacy, love and belonging. And here, too quickly, the idyll becomes infused with all the tensions of adulthood.\nSian Davey is a photographer with a background in Fine Art and Social Policy. Her work is an investigation of the psychological landscapes of both herself and those around her. Her family and community are central to her work.\nMartha is available to pre-order now via Trolley Books."

She couldn\u2019t tell if the god had destroyed it, or just sent it away.\nHer flying powers were gone. She fell with a surprised yelp.\nPart of her brain tabulated strings.

The reality strings that connected her to the ground popped into view. One string was gravity. One was falling. One was her.\nShe didn\u2019t think, just grabbed two strings and adjusted them, just a little.\nThe falling stopped so suddenly, her teeth clicked together.\nOnce she caught her breath, she lowered herself slowly toward the ground.

She decided to not think about it.\nShe looked for the reality string to lower herself again.\nThe cloud face puffed out in pleasure. It giggled.\nMiranda was clean out of fear. At this point she was just angry.\nHundreds of strings made up the clouds. She yanked and the clouds dissipated.\nThe god laughed and she fell again. The ground rushed at her and she grabbed another string. She fell faster.\nShe\u2019d find out if she was immortal or not.\nThe air thickened around her. First she was falling through clouds, then rain, then she was surrounded by water.\nWater went down her throat and she gagged. She reflexively yanked at strings and water exploded away from her. She coughed out water, distantly aware that she was falling again.\nShe reached out for other strings, but nothing caught in her fingers.\nRandom strings slid past her hands. The sky turned green. The continents swirled below her. Confetti blew around her in a cloud. Still the ground rushed at her.\n\u201cYOU\u2019RE THE BEST DAUGHTER EVER. SO MUCH FUN.\u201d The mad god let out an explosive laugh. A new hole expanded around her and she fell into a new universe."

The remnants of the cool morning mist swirled about her, clinging on to her limbs as the Accepted went through a familiar routine. She felt rusty, the movements coming a haltingly as they were dredged out from memory. Most felt right, though a few less so as muscles responded to the memory of a memory.\n\u201cLight\u201d Celeste thought to herself, \u201cIts been ages since I last practiced my calisthenics. Nogusta would murder me if he saw me now.\u201d The Accepted grinned privately at the mental image of the annoyed old instructor. While she managed to maintain the lean, slim body that she had possessed before entering the Tower, the Accepted knew that her sword work and muscular co-ordination had deteriorated to the point where her brother would drop his weapons laughing if she tried to practice the forms.\nFinally limbering up into some semblance of flexibility, Celeste started to run. A slow languid jog took her around the edges of the Tower grounds, familiar features looking hazy in the mist. Smooth fabric slid over her skin as she ran, the soft feel of her own leggings and shirt a welcome change from the worn cotton dress she had to wear normally. Though the Aes Sedai were usually quite picky over the dresses, most of them were reasonable enough not to make a point of it if the activity was sufficiently physical.\nPanting as she pulled up beside the post she had started from, the Accepted wiped her brow. Sweating profusely, she began stretching again as the mist began evaporating under the morning sun.\nCeleste made her slow way down the corridor, picking her way through the mid morning jam outside the dining hall. This was the one place in the Tower that could always be relied on to possess a crowd during daylight hours.\nEntering the designated hall, the Accepted felt mild surprise at the crowd of people within. Separated into two roughly equal groups, the Gaidin-in-training clustered at one end around the Head Gaidin while, at the other, the Accepted and Novices bunched in little chatting groups.\nFeeling the cool stone beneath the soles of her thin shoes, Celeste moved towards the sea of white, turquoise eyes seeking the Keeper. There was to be a lesson today, though the details had been left vague purposely. Celeste had been in the Tower long enough to recognize dissembling when she saw it. Whatever had been actually written on the announcement accounted for nothing in terms of specifics. In truth, it was this that had intrigued the Accepted more than anything else, distracting her sufficiently from her readings to attend. Celeste sincerely hoped it would not be a waste of time.\nCatching a glimpse Demetri Sedai through the white wall, Celeste pushed forward a little to make her attendance known and to register herself. As always, the Keeper had kind words, asking about lessons and activities with enough specifics to reveal how closely she actually monitored them all. Chatting easily, the Sister made small talk until another Novice came up. Giving way, Celeste moved back into the crowd, waiting for the lesson to commence."

It\u2019s important to them. They adore the songs, and so do I (or maybe I just like seeing how much they adore the songs). And, of course, they belt out \u201cLet It Go\u201d with the passion that can only be found in a Disney-infused 8 year old.\nContext: Queen-to-be Elsa is cursed to turn everything she touches into ice. She lives in hiding for years and years to spare the world from her so-called destructive quality. When the curse which she has suppressed for so many years is unleashed, she \u201ccan\u2019t hold it back anymore\u201d and begins a process of embracing who she is and the curse she has (first by running away, then eventually by using the power of love to use her so-called curse to save the day).\nBecause you know what definition I learned?\nI learned that \u201clet it go\u201d was synonymous with \u201cbehave.\u201d These were words I heard when I happened to be sad about something longer than I was supposed to be (God forbid!).\u201d Or when I cared about something more than I should. When I was suffering. When I needed to pretend something wasn\u2019t bothering me.\n\u201cLet it go\u201d was always about hiding. For those three words to become a call to emotional honesty and an empowerment of true identity\u2026that\u2019s huge. It\u2019s huge for my students, and it\u2019s huge for me.\nEssentially, the \u201cIT\u201d in let it go has changed.\nWhen I was growing up, let it go = let go of your feelings, let go of your history, let go of your dreams, let go of your true self.\nFor the Frozen generation, let it go = let go of expectations, let go of trying to please everyone, let go of hiding. Oh, and love everyone else through their truth, too.\nGuess which one is a way, way better message for our kids?\nWatching those same words which used to assault me into \u201cmoving on\u201d encourage my students to move inward and to express themselves? Beautiful. Just beautiful.\nFrozen soundtrack, you are welcome in my classroom any day."

Read on for four tips to manage this problem and strengthen your relationship.\nExpectations are beliefs about the way things will or should be. They come from the family we grew up in, the relationships we have had, and the culture that surrounds us (i.e., family traditions, religious or ethnic backgrounds, media, etc.). While we all have expectations, unmet expectations can lead to conflict, frustration, and relationship dissatisfaction. On the other hand, learning to manage expectations is one of the keys to healthy relationships. Consider these four tips to managing unmet expectations.\n1. Identify your expectations as well as those of your loved one.\nUnspoken expectations and expectations that you may not even be conscious of are often at the root of conflict. Take a step back to examine what expectations might exist that you may not have considered before. Consider the common topics of conflict.\nStep back and look at your expectations from another perspective. Is it reasonable for the current situation? Just because you would prefer it or it may have \u201calways been done that way\u201d doesn\u2019t mean that it is the best and most realistic solution for current circumstances.\nExpress your preferences using \u201cI\u201d messages and take time to listen to other\u2019s desires. We may not always agree with their expectations, but validating each other\u2019s perspective can set a positive tone for finding a realistic compromise that is acceptable for everyone.\n4. Seek for a win-win solution.\nRemember, if the solution is not win-win everyone loses. If a win-win solution does not seem possible, then find a way to equally compromise or take turns compromising. Be sure to get back together after an agreed upon time to evaluate, discuss and make adjustments, if needed.\nWhile unmet expectations create frustration and conflict, following these four tips will provide opportunities to grow closer and build happier and healthier relationships.\nLearn more great tips to strengthen your relationships at www.relationships.usu.edu.\nThis article was written by Naomi Brower.

                            "text": "He turned slowly back to the room. A duvet wrinkled, the threads rubbing together. Jimmy rubbed his hands together similarly. The look of terror and desperation cracked apart between a wide smile. His face remained flush. Jimmy knew the blood was gushing somewhere else. The underwear slid down his sheened legs. Connie, her naked flesh glistening in the glow of the ancient lights.\nJimmy smiled wryly, slinking back into the bed. She moved her hands under the covers, making sure that he was ready to carry on. As her hand touched him, his smile opened. He was ready, and in a few brief, intense minutes the passion was out of them both as they sunk again into the mattress. The pocketed springs gave a last, long groan, and the couple finally fell into a happy, relieved slumber.\nIt was but a brief respite. Outside, the hazy sky filled with thunder and a storm buffeted the construction of the house. The spittle of rain on the clouded-up bedroom window became steadily more intense, more regular.\nIt also hid the sound of the lock clicking, padded footsteps pacing in through the bedroom door and the steady scrape of sharpened metal on the treads of the staircase.\nIn quick succession: THWACK! THWACK! THWACK!\nConnie quickly gasped. She shuddered, suddenly feeling a chill. Her eyes opened, and she saw the rain on the window. The frame was rattling in the wind. She took a breath, beginning to sit up. Rubbing her eyes, her ears now focused on the sound outside the door.\nHe murmured again, and sleepily gestured her away. As if to say not right now.\n\u201cYes, now!\u201d she hissed, her foot finding his leg. He shook, then got up out of bed. He found the door handle in the darkness. The handle rattled but didn\u2019t move. There was an electrical buzzing and, as he noticed the lights in the room had extinguished, his head turned.\nBefore Connie could answer, the bedroom door seemed to fall open by itself. Jimmy\u2019s head turned, and, with a grunt of surprise, he saw Mrs. Chaldean, standing in the doorway.\nConnie laughed as Jimmy retrieved his clothes from the heap on the floor. He stood up, just as a muffled but distinct voice came through the door.\nJimmy didn\u2019t answer. He stared at Connie. His eyes returned to Mrs. Chaldean. In the gloom b y her legs, a black plastic sack, like those used for rubbish, flapped and crackled. Their gaze met. Jimmy said nothing about the sack.\nSome low, light thuds echoed through the building as Mrs. Chaldean climbed the stairwell to the third floor, where her quarters were. Jimmy, breathless, looked to Connie. He climbed back into the bed.\n\u201cWe\u2019re out of here by eight tomorrow, alright?\u201d He growled. His eyes rolled to upstairs, as he heard a wheeze of a mattress, much quieter than the racket that Jimmy and Connie had connived to bring about. Then silence.\nJimmy gave a sceptical glance to the room, as if he could see something in the darkness, but shook his head. He felt drowsy and the pillows on the bed next to Connie looked much more inviting now.\nFinally, it seemed that the ghosts that lurked the corridors of Holman Hall would let their guests slumber. Jimmy slipped into the bed. The sheets crinkled. He felt Connie\u2019s warmth close by, and a hand wandered from his side toward hers, tenting the linen subtly, then meeting the taut flesh. She hummed, and he hummed too, taking a deep breath of her essence.\nEyes closed, Jimmy smiled, and his tented hands fell flat on Connie\u2019s thigh, and wandered further in a well-rehearsed dance of the five fingers. He took another deep breath, about to make the final flourish of his act, but the breath stirred him in a way he didn\u2019t expect. In the dark his eyes screwed up and his naked shoulders rolled restlessly. He withdrew, feeling a tingling sensation in the back of his mind. Somehow, his eyes open now and glistening, he felt he was being observed by a force of powers unimaginable.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Connie murmured, feeling the disturbance in the bed and the removal of Jimmy\u2019s hand.\nHe waved, making a noncommittal noise, and let the drowsiness descend onto his dewy eyes, and fell into a perturbed, slumber, his arms like those of plastic figurines, cast closely to his self. They stayed there, stiff and immobile, all night.\nA cold draft rattled the loose window frame again. It roused Connie. She\u2019d been awake for a good while already but maintaining the pretence of sleep with closed eyes. Maybe this strange house would melt into her familiar surroundings if she wished it hard enough?\nShe opened her eyes after the rattling carried across the room. She took a shallow breath. Cold stale air. Connie sat up, and the chill caught her skin, bringing out goosepimples on her naked breasts as the duvet fell with the same raspy sound that had kept her awake with every subconscious movement.\nNext to her, Jimmy murmured incomprehensibly as he stirred, his eyes opening slowly. He smiled, seeing her sitting in bed, gazing sleepily across the top of her goose pimpled frontage.\nBefore she could reply, there was a clatter outside and the door to the room flung open. Quickly, Connie wrenched the cover up. Mrs Chaldean leant in.\n\u201cSix-thirty, loves. About time you young things were up and out of that bed, I should think!\u201d Mrs. Chaldean trilled, drawing the door closed with a muffled thump.\nConnie threw the bedcovers off, despite the coldness that brought up her skin like a Christmas turkey. She looked out of the window, seeing sunshine in the sky but not feeling any of its warmth. Turning back, she saw Jimmy propped up in the bed.\nJimmy finished dressing by pulling on a cardigan from the bottom of his backpack over his shoulders and opened the door. \u201cLadies first,\u201d he said playfully. Connie, despite her scorn, couldn\u2019t fail to smile, just a tiny bit.\nThe dining room looked brighter than it did the night before, and as the couple trooped down the staircase, the sound of clattering cutlery against porcelain grew steadily louder, and the warm scent of a cooked breakfast wafted, meeting Jimmy and Connie midway down. They paused for a moment, savouring it.\nJimmy did so, but Connie paused for a moment. Her eyes were drawn to the locked door of the reception room. In the morning sun the hallway was full of motes of hanging dust, disturbed only by the passage of the two guests toward the dining room. Her gaze on the door was broken only by the rattling of the dining room handle under Jimmy\u2019s hands. Shaking her head, she followed.\n\u201cTwo, what do you\u2026\u201d he began to protest, but felt a pain bolting across his shin. He corrected course quickly, for the second time in as many minutes.\n\u201cYes, lets,\u201d the landlady replied with a sigh. The conversation petered out, replaced with the sounds of breakfast being eaten.\nAs they ate, Mrs. Chaldean excused herself. The kitchen door clattered closed. Pulling back her shawl, she checked the watch on her withered wrist. Wordlessly she acknowledged the tiny movement, then made a tiny movement herself, gliding across to the sideboard by the door. The register opened under the lightest of touches, the pages flittering past, propelled by a mystical kind of hurry.\n\u201cLet\u2019s change that, shall we?\u201d Mrs. Chaldean hummed to herself. \u201cPut that right.\u201d She crossed the latest two entries in the register."

He looked over at her.\nThe light switched back on and the next one appeared. His face came into frame and she leaned forward slightly, studying his long nose, the curve of his upper lip, and the unfamiliar wide set brown eyes.\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said simply, slumping back against the seat. She continued to slide the pendant between her fingertips.\nThe officer let out a sigh, and rubbed a hand over his mouth. He leaned against the edge of the table, folding his arms across his chest.\n\u201cYou have to help us. You have to give us something. We\u2019re doing all we can on our part,\u201d said Officer Jim, his voice rough and deep.\nShe stretched her legs forward, resting her elbows on the arm of the metal chair. She could feel him watching her and when she didn\u2019t answer, he let out a sigh and let his hands drop to his sides.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have many left,\u201d he announced, his voice echoing through the small room.\nHe openly stared at her before shaking his head. \u201cLet\u2019s get the next one up.\u201d His voice was loud, authoritative.\nThe light continued to flicker on and off, echoing off the word \u201cNo,\u201d that continued to be repeated through the enclosed room.\nShe could tell he was getting more and more irritated with each, \u201cNo,\u201d she muttered, but she stayed slouched in her chair, avoiding eye contact.\n\u201cWell that\u2019s it,\u201d his voice boomed, the light flickering off. He tossed a pile of papers onto the desk in front of her, and they landed with a soft thud. \u201cThat\u2019s everyone.\u201d He crossed his arms over his chest, looking expectantly at her.\nShe sat motionless with her face straight, continually sliding the necklace between her fingertips.\nThe lights switched back on, and she could see all the men lined up together. She examined their glaring faces or bored stares, the ones who had tattoos creeping up their necks, the ones who had multiple piercings running across their faces, the ones whose lips were frozen in permanent frowns. Her eyebrows furrowed ever so slightly at the unfamiliar appearances, and she absentmindedly twisted the pendant around it\u2019s chain.\nAfter a minute, she breathed out, feeling herself deflate into the chair when Officer Davis strolled across the room, into view. Her eyes snapped up and she stared at his lanky figure, the ink black hair that peeked out from underneath his cap, and the icy blue eyes that suddenly locked with hers through that one-way glass.\nShe inhaled sharply, dropping the necklace, and shoot up in her seat, knees banging into the table.\n\u201cMiss Brenson?\u201d Officer Jim called out, his voice gruff.\nShe tentatively leaned forward and sucked in a breath when she made out the fading scratch on his left cheekbone. Gripping the arm of the chair, she dug her fingernails into the material.\n\u201cMiss Brenson?\u201d He repeated, louder.\nShe ignored him, frozen, every muscle on her body stilled. Her back stiffened alonged the metal chain, her spine pressing deeply into it. Her eyes followed after every possible man as they strolled out of the room, Officer Davis slinking after them.\nAs she heard the doorknob groan open, she squeezed her eyes shut, feeling her heart pound furiously against her chest.\nOfficer Davis\u2019 shoes thundered louder with each long stride he took forward. She forced her eyes open and followed his gangly figure stalk through the room and felt the world tilt sideways as he crossed in front of her table. She sunk her fingernails into her thigh, pressing down, down, down, her eyes flying shut.\nShe could still feel his grip on his wrist, the way he crushed her hand and gripped at her throat, his kneecap pressing into her ribcage. The deep green marks had faded to a dull blue and she could swallow normally again, but she still woke up in the middle of the night, drenched in sweat, unable to stop herself from shaking.\nShe avoided his eyes and fixated on the tile floor, allowing herself to catch her breath.\nFor a moment, she considered screaming, pointing at him, begging Officer Jim to take her somewhere safe. But then she thought of the nights she spent in the hospital, striped further of the last bit of dignity she had, the countless therapy appointments she canceled and was then forced to go to, and the time she spent locked in her room, boxed off from the world.\nAnd then she remembered the crowbar she had nestled in the trunk of her car and she dug her nails into her palm.\n\u201cMiss Brenson?\u201d Officer Jim asked again.\nFrom the corner of the room, she could feel Officer Davis\u2019 dead, icy gaze on her, but she willed herself still, and kept her gaze forward, straight ahead.\nShe pictured the zip ties and tape nestled under the blankets. She thought of the therapy sessions. She thought about the wasted hours she spent checking to make sure her windows were locked, one, two, three times. And she relieved that night over and over again, she was not free of it.\n\u201cMiss. Brenson.\u201d Officer Jim said, his voice clipped, a warning following between each syllable.\nClearing her throat, she shifted and forced herself to lean back against the seat. Her shirt clung to her back and she felt the material sink in to her slick skin. Her fingers trembled slightly before they found the pendant again, clasping her fingers tightly around it. It was delivered to her through the mail - the police officers assumed it was hers after they found it at the crime scene. She never told them it wasn\u2019t.\nOfficer Jim looked at her expectantly and a sense of calm settled over her and sunk into her skin.\nShe could sense Officer Davis shift slightly in the corner."

Xellos sat in the chair across from her, gazing at his reflection in his whine glass.\n\ufffdSo Xellos dear,\ufffd Xellas said in her eerie, sinister voice, \ufffdDo you understand your job?\ufffd She looked up from her whine glass and took another smoke from her cigarette.\nXellos set down his whine cup and bowed, his purple hair falling over his eyes in the shadows, \ufffdAs you wish.\ufffd With that he was gone in a blur.\nXellas giggle to herself, \ufffdOh this should be fun!\ufffd She laughed as she sipped her whine; the blood red liquid quenching her thirst as her demonic eyes gazed back evilly at her through the crystalline of her glass.\nThe crickets chirped silently in the cool summer\ufffds breeze. The moon\ufffds full shine lit up the room as it bounced from object to object until it hit Lina\ufffds eyes. She sleepily turned over when she heard a sigh come from the direction of the window. She sat up, her long crimson hair flowing loosely across her shoulders and back, and gazed in that direction. Janai was sitting by the window, her beautiful red hair tumbled loosely along the cold, hard floor of the room, her lace nightgown hung loosely around her body. The moon cast an eerie, almost inhuman glow across her face, as she gazed up into the starlit sky. Lina slowly crept out of bed, as not to wake the slumbering Princess, and over to the window where Janai sat, locked in a dreamy daze out into the moonlit plains below.\n\ufffdWhat are you doing awake, Janai?\ufffd Lina asked in a sleepy whisper.\n\ufffdI couldn\ufffdt sleep. So I decided to sit here and think.\ufffd She said, not taking her gaze away from the window.\n\ufffdGoodnight Janai.\ufffd Lina turned back around and tiptoed over to her bed, laid down, her eyelids heavy, and fell asleep to the beauty of Janai\ufffds words.\nThe sun shown brightly through the crystalline pane of the window, reflecting spectrums of light across the room. The birds began to chirp their morning songs of happiness, and the air was fresh with the scent of morning dew. The suns rays warmed Lina\ufffds face as she slowly opened her eyes, the sounds of the birds filling the room, the bright sun light warming her gentle skin. She yawned and stretched as she slowly slipped out of bed and started to get dressed. She was nearly done when she heard her roommate, Amelia, wake.\nAmelia pranced in, \ufffdGood Morning Miss Lina! Did you sleep well? Say, where is Miss Janai?\ufffd Her voice seemed to be even perkier in the sunlit morning.\n\ufffdMaybe so. Well let\ufffds go down and check Miss Lina!\ufffd Lina and Amelia exited their peaceful room and proceeded down the narrow hallway to the stairs. It was much darker in the hallway, because there were no windows to let in the sunlight. As Lina walked, she continually thought about her conversation with Janai the night before. They proceeded down the stairs and to the lobby of the Inn. Sure enough, Janai was sitting with Zelgadis at a table in the diner.\n\ufffdThere\ufffds Miss Janai and Mr. Zelgadis!\ufffd Amelia said, waving to them and prancing over to the table. Lina walked slowly over, pretending as if she had nothing to do with the Prancing Princess of Perk. Janai and Zelgadis looked up from their conversation and Janai smiled and waved back to the princess.\n\ufffdGood morning Lina.\ufffd Janai said, smiling warmly.\n\ufffdMost likely sleeping in the heap where I left him.\ufffd Janai snickered. The diner was small, but sufficient. It was drawn with many windows and amber decor. The bright sunlit filled the room, reflecting from object to object. As Lina looked at Janai, she could see the light reflecting off her eyes, making their blue sereneness even more golden. Lina pulled out her chair and sat down.\n\ufffdSo, any plans as for what to do next?\ufffd Lina asked, leaning back and putting her feet against the table.\n\ufffdGreat idea!\ufffd Amelia\ufffds perk was a little too much then any of them could handle, especially early in the morning. There was the slow trudge of footsteps down the stairs, as they turned to see Gourry walking limply down the stairs, his golden hair a mess, drawn partially over one eye.\nWhen everyone was done, they decided it was time to go out and try to find some trouble for them to keep occupied in. They walked down the dirt path on the outside of town. On either side were trees, flowers, and plants of every kind and color. The birds were singing as they hunted for food for their young and the bright sun was melting the last bit of dew off the leaves. Lina looked up to the sun, shielding her eyes from its glare, and watched an eagle soar overhead. Everything was so alive, so pretty, like in a picture. A pair of majestic violet eyes watched the group from the shadows as they proceeded on, the sounds of their conversation ringing through the peaceful trees.\nJanai turned sharply, her long red hair flowing behind her; she examined the brush, but turned back around and proceeded onward.\n\ufffdWhat\ufffds wrong Janai?\ufffd Zelgadis could think of nothing more then to examine the beauty in front of him, especially that of his new mysterious companion. She was so enchanting, everything about her was like the pictures in a fairy tale, he wanted to know as much as he could about her mysterious life, and unlock it at for his own.\nThe dark eyes from the brush snickered and whispered to itself, \ufffdSoon, very soon\ufffd\ufffd Zelgadis looked around, his demon ears had picked up the sounds of the voice, but couldn\ufffdt understand it. All he could hear was the haunting echoes of darkness.\nAs they continued walking, they ran into a crossroad, which split in three different directions. The bright sun shimmered against the leaves of the trees. \ufffdWhich way should we go?\ufffd Lina looked down each path as far as she could.\n\ufffdHow do we know if we can trust you, and who are you?\ufffd Lina got trembles of fear as she looked into the woman\ufffds eyes.\n\ufffdI am Kaitou, and this is my brother Kaishi.\ufffd She pointed behind her to the man who had just caught up with her. He looked up toward the group, his handsome face being blinded by the light of the morning sun.\n\ufffdWe are know as the Fukachi Twins. That way is the way you wish to take, and someday, we shall cross paths again, Lina Inverse.\ufffd Kaitou\ufffds voice echoed slowly away as her and her brother disappeared before their eyes.\n\ufffdWell that was just\ufffdodd.\ufffd Lina staggered with her words, and proceeded to walk down the middle path. \ufffdFukachi\ufffdThe ancient word for unknown, or mysterious. There is going to be trouble from those two. I can sense it.\ufffd The others followed Lina down the path, discussing their encounter with the strange twins along the way. The birds had begun to chirp again, and all returned to as it should be, the gentle pools of water, reflecting the suns glow and warming the air around it.\nBy the time they reached Simbachi, the sun was already starting to set. The sky turned orange and red as the bright yellow sun moved further and further down into the horizon. The path was covered in an eerie glow, the fires of the sky raining down upon it. The weary travelers checked into the town inn and eat at the small diner. The sunset flourished through the windows, casting shades of fire across the quiet room. A dark figure lurking in the shadows came to a halt. It\ufffds face dimmed in the fiery shadows as the sun blazed across the horizon. Within the blink of an eye, the figure vanished in a ribbon of dark clouds.\nXellos Metallium sat in his lair, the small light of the chandelier casting flickering shadows across the room. His lavender eyes, alive with mischief, gazing upon the wilted pages of a book.\n\ufffdOh what fun I\ufffdm going to have!\ufffd He snickered happily to himself as he looked up from his book, then turned his attention back to it. His voice was overcome with darkness as he recited the chartings in the book aloud. A wave of his hand and a mess of fire and darkness spread across the room then slowly faded away, and there were shadows once more. Xellos grinned happily and vanished without a trace.\n\ufffdSo, what do you think these \ufffdMysterious Twins\ufffd, want?\ufffd Zelgadis stared into his cup of tea, not even looking up as he spoke. The sun had set, and the restaurant was lit by the flickering of candles and chandeliers. The bleak silhouetted outlines of people framed the walls, dancing in an eerie, darkened pattern.\n\ufffdNo clue. But I think that they mean trouble.\ufffd Lina leaned back in her chair, as she often did when she was talking.\n\ufffdWell they showed us the right way, didn\ufffdt they?\ufffd Gourry might have been dumb, but he did have his moments of glory\ufffdhis few moments of glory and this just happened to be one of them.\n\ufffdThis isn\ufffdt the time to get into that.\ufffd Zelgadis interrupted, looking up from his tea. Janai sat to his right, holding her cup with both hands and gazing down into its liquid contents.\n\ufffdAnyway, I think it would be best if we all got some rest, and discussed it in the morning, ne?\ufffd Janai\ufffds voice was sweet and rhythmic. Zelgadis didn\ufffdt know what it was, but tonight he felt more drawn to her. He wanted to study every aspect of her and enjoy her beauty.\n\ufffdThat\ufffds a good idea, Miss Janai.\ufffd Amelia slowly got up from her chair and went in the direction of the inn. They all got up and followed her, but Zelgadis couldn\ufffdt stand it any longer.\n\ufffdJanai?\ufffd He sweetly tapped her shoulder. She turned her gaze around at him, and her eyes seemed more beautiful then ever before. He loved the way her silken red hair framed her delicate face, and her eyes, so full of pain, so full of beauty gazed compassionately at everything around her. He wanted to just gaze into her eyes and tell her how he felt. For some reason, he had the courage that had never been there before, like a sweet magic spell wanting him to be closer to her, feeling her touch, meeting her every gaze.\n\ufffdYes Zelgadis?\ufffd Her eyes met his gaze as she turned around. His eyes were so beautiful, she thought. She had never really noticed them that much, until tonight. She could feel something special about that night, the auras of angels gleaming, singing their sweet rhapsodies of love. She loved how the sound of her name flowed of his tongue in his deep, soothing voice. Though she didn\ufffdt know what made her enjoy his company so much that night, and she didn\ufffdt really care.\nShe gazed back into his eyes, studying every single magnificent detail of his face. She gently squeezed his hands, they were so warm, she\ufffdd expected them to be cold as stone. \ufffdYes Zelgadis?\ufffd Her voice filled the emptiness of the alley, bouncing from wall to wall until it muted into the flesh and stone. They stood, in hushed silence, as she slowly moved closer too him, and he wrapped his arms around her and pulled her close, holding her tight.\n\ufffdI just wanted to tell you\ufffdhow beautiful you are\ufffdand that\ufffd\ufffd She hushed him with a finger to her lips.\n\ufffdI know\ufffd\ufffd He held her close, she could feel his warmth, he could smell her beautiful aroma. He raised a hand and ran it through the back of her hair; it was soft as finest silk, so gentle against his skin. She leaned up to him, and slowly their soft lips pressed as their silhouettes danced on the wall by the light of the moon.\nHome to the Crossing Pasts Page!\nHome to the Fanfiction Page!"

That would prevent the warps from bending. If the tension is too tight, the warps will be straight and that will force the wefts to do all the bending. Besides draw-in problems, the cloth will be more weft face with the wefts beaten down more than for a balanced look.\nand how it affects your cloth\u2019s draw-in.\nBalanced plain weave is shown in Figure 518a.\nprovides the slack needed to allow for the wefts to bend. The warps bend after the cloth is taken off the loom when there is no longer any tension on them. Remember, you allowed for this occurrence in planning the length of the warp by adding in an allowance for \u201ctake-up.\u201d See page 290.\neven bubbling of the weft is needed. Read about bubbling on page 128.\nIn Figure 518c, the warps are very close together (more ends per inch), and they are bending, but the wefts are straight. This is warp-faced plain weave. Warps that close force the wefts to be straight. These warps take up much more than those in balanced weaving do, because they have to curve so much over and under the wefts. Less slack or weft diagonal is needed because the wefts are straight and do not bend.\nA student came today with an exquisitely gorgeous fabric which frustrated her so much while weaving that she cut it off the loom and threw away the remainder of the warp! When I showed her this illustration from my new book, Weaving for Beginners, she could see that the selvedge threads were being abraded by the reed. The following is found on page 302 in the chapter on selvedges. Beautiful selvedges aren\u2019t the end in itself, but the result of techniques that solve ugly selvedge problems and broken threads. I\u2019ll be posting more on selvedges, I\u2019ll bet.\nA common selvedge problem: Too much draw-in In my teaching experience, the problem that showed up almost as soon as the weaving began was that the cloth narrowed in too much. If the problem wasn\u2019t noticed and dealt with soon, the selvedge threads would begin to break by the abrasion of the reed. Look at the edges of the warp at the fell. Is the reed stretching out the warps way beyond the width of the cloth? If so, can you see why the reed is abrading and breaking the selvedges? Too much draw-in at the selvedges is shown in Figure 517.\nIf you have a big draw-in problem, you can use a temple or stretcher cords such as croc clips. See page 312. To understand more why the cloth draws in and how to control it so the selvedge threads don\u2019t break, read the sidebar, \u201cHow warps and wefts bend,\u201d on the next page.\n1. The warp tension is too tight.\n3. The wefts are pulled too tightly at the selvedges.\n1. The warp tension should not be tight, certainly not tight like a violin string.\neach side, you have put in enough slack.

That's a huge advantage over most of the more advanced text effects we can create since they usually force us to convert our text into either pixels or vector shapes, at which point we lose the ability to edit the text.\nAnother advantage with the Warp Text options is that the warping effects themselves also remain 100% fully editable. Nothing we do with them permanently changes the look of our type. Photoshop simply remembers the settings we used and essentially shows us a live preview of what those settings look like. We can go back at any time and change any of the settings. We can also switch to a completely different warping option, or we can turn the warp options off and switch back to the normal text, all without any loss of image quality. Finally, while many advanced text effects require lots of time and effort, not to mention some advanced skills, Photoshop's Warp Text options are fast and easy to use, even for beginners!\nThe Layers panel showing the Type layer above the Background layer.\nSelecting the Type Tool from the Tools panel.\nClicking on the Warp Text option in the Options Bar.\nThe Warp Text dialog box.\nSelecting the Arc style from the top of the list.\nPhotoshop shows us a live preview of the result in the document.\nLowering the Bend value for the Arc style to 25%.\nThe warping effect has been reduced after lowering the Bend value.\nDragging the Bend slider into the negative values.\nThe text now arcs downward with a negative Bend value.\nThe Arc style now warps the text from left to right with Vertical selected.\nNext, we'll look at Horizontal Distortion and Vertical Distortion, two interesting but potentially confusing options that have nothing at all to do with your chosen warp style.\nThere are two other options in the bottom half of the Warp Text dialog box - Horizontal Distortion and Vertical Distortion. These two options can be a bit confusing because while the Bend value controls the intensity of our chosen warp style, the Horizontal and Vertical Distortion options are completely independent effects. What makes it confusing is that Photoshop forces us to choose a style from the Style option before it gives us access to the Horizontal and Vertical Distortion sliders, but the distortion effects have nothing to do with the style we chose and in fact, we can use these sliders even if we effectively turn the warp style off.\nLeaving Arc selected but setting the Bend value to 0%.\nA Bend value of 0% effectively turns the style off.\nIncreasing Horizontal Distortion to 80%.\nThe result of applying horizontal distortion to the text.\nLowering the Horizontal Distortion to -80%.\nA negative Horizontal Distortion value flips the direction of the effect.\nIncreasing Vertical Distortion to 25%.\nThe text with 25% Vertical Distortion applied.\nLowering Vertical Distortion to -25%.\nThe text with Vertical Distortion set to -25%.\nIt's unlikely that you'll want to use the Horizontal and Vertical Distortion options very often, and as I mentioned, they're completely independent of the warp style you've chosen. In most cases, you'll simply want to choose a warp style from the Style option and then adjust the intensity of the warp using the Bend slider while leaving the Horizontal and Vertical Distortion options set to their default values of 0%.\nThe Type layer now displays the Warp Text icon in the thumbnail.\nClicking again on the Warp Text option.\nChanging the Style from Arc to Flag and setting Bend to 25%.\nThe same text with the Flag style applied.\nAnd there we have it!

                            "text": "How fast is Impulse, Warp and Warp X speed?\nAs I have understood it, Warp (1) speed = 1x Speed of Light (SoL), i.e. ~300.000 km/s. However, in ST:VOY, they are hurled 70.000 LY from Earth, which will take 70 years to travel at Warp 9, i.e. Warp 9 = 1000x SoL. That makes no sense to me.\nIf Warp doubles for each full number (binary numbers), then Warp 10 would be 1024x SoL ~ 68 years journey. That works fine, in approximation, given they need to make various stops on the way and/or take small detours to fly through star systems on the way. But no... Not only is Warp 10 impossible (why is that, anyway?), but anything over Warp 9,0 is reserved for burst only. Thus sustained travel is limited to Warp 9, which would (by my calculations) be 512x SoL ~ 135-140 years journey. But this doesn't match any known numbers..\nBonus question: How fast is Impulse drive? You can travel in a shuttle from Earth to Jupiter in a few hours. We only ever hear about quarter, half and full Impulse speed. But at the same scale, you can travel to Jupiter in a few hours, but you can also navigate a safe landing on a planet/moon, through the atmosphere.. Again, I see no consistancy in this..\nIn TOS, we do not have an explicit conversion, but all stated velocities used WF^3.\nThe following are rounded to 1 decimal place.\nAbove 9.0, between 9.0 and 10, the exponent increases dramatically, and warp 10 is theoretically infinite speed.\nIt is worth noting, however, that in All Good Things (the closing Episode of TNG), the scale appears to continue to Factor 14 at this same WF^(10/3) progression. The on-screen stated speed for factor 13 is a match.\nFurther, the TNG Tech Manual mentions that this is an average speed, and that factors in local subspace topology can affect the speed in either direction.\nImpulse is given several explicit speeds in various episodes. The term Full Impulse seems to be relative, and as per naval tradition, Full Impulse appears to be maximum the engines can provide, which varies from about 0.05C to an explicit 0.8C (in Voyager).\nMemory Alpha has a nice table of speeds in relation to \"c\" (the speed of light). In brief, it's very inconsistent (though more inconsistent between eras, i.e. from TOS to TNG), but it follows an approximate logarithmic (or exponential, perhaps?) increase: Warp 1 is equal to c, but warp 2 is equal to 8x c.\nEDIT: Incidentally, in this scale, warp 10 is impossible because it's classified as \"infinite speed\", with the ship's speed approaching the asymptote of infinite speed as it adds more decimal places to its speed. Starfleet likely chose Warp 10 to be an arbitrary speed very high on the curve that they thought they would never reach, only to draw closer and closer to it as they built better and more efficient engines. A failure of imagination perhaps? Blame the Vulcans.\nAs for impulse, Memory Alpha references a few episodes where impulse was stated to have a speed far, far smaller than c (full impulse described as 2.5% of c), leading to an Earth-Jupiter run of over 34 hours. But it also means you're traveling at 7,500 km/s, so rather difficult to land at that speed.\nImpulse speed (for a starship) is between 0.25c and 0.8c (maximum speeds of course) and usually restricted to sublight.\nWarp drive is a bit more trickier, but it was established that the technical manuals are not canon. Still, even if Warp 9 = 3000 times LS (for example), in Voyager, it was established on screen that Warp 9.9 = 21 473 times LS.\nNow, if in TNG Warp 9.9 = 3000 times LS, that could simply mean that the Warp scale might have been re-calibrated (again) and 9.9 now ended up at 4 billion miles per second.\nAt any rate, Warp factors and speeds fluctuate wildly in canon. I usually stick with the on-screen dialogue however and use higher values as the technology and science in Trek certainly should allow for them. So, Warp 9.9 = 21 473 times LS.\nBut I think that doubling of speed with every incremental increase is valid for Warp speeds above 9.9 (meaning that 9.91 = 42946 times LS, etc.) Of course, past Warp 9, speeds start increasing quite fast anyway. So, if Warp 9 (or 9.2) = 1500 times LS and 9.9 = 21 473 times LS, then we have several decimals of large increases to work with.\nWarp 10 was stated to be in Voyager 'infinite velocity'. Anywhere in between you can have a large range of speeds that can be achieved through say more efficient/powerful Warp drive (recalibrated Warp scale in TNG final episode where they said Warp 13, etc), Slisptream, Transwarp and Coaxial warp drive (to name a few).\nSlisptream v1 seemed to have equaled 300 ly's per hour at maximum from on-screen dialogue. For protracted periods of time though, it was suggested the crew of Voyager would need to be in Slipstream for 3 months (which in itself suggests the ship would have needed to go much slower for extended periods of time to allow crew survival - or it was possible the engines on the Dauntless couldn't sustain maximum velocity for long periods of time).\nSlisptream V2 as developed by Voyager crew (who used a number of technologies) in 'Timeless' seemed to have allowed speeds of 10 000 ly's per minute (and if you check the dialogue, it says that the slisptream variance doesn't appear until about 17 seconds into the flight... which doesn't leave much time for Voyager to experience issues and crash into its doom or for future Kim to send the needed data back in time to help disperse the Slipstream).\nThis version of Slipstream even seemed to surpass Borg Transwarp capabilities (at least until the Dauntless and Arturis were assimilated by the Borg, which could have lead to the Collective to improve their TW drives by the end of Voyager series).\nAnyway... There are also Soliton Waves which traveled at below Warp 9 (though showed evidence they can increase in speeds), but the thing is that ships using soliton wave technology wouldn't need actual Warp engines (further research into this technology might have yielded SF with better mobile control that didn't require another station at the end to disperse the wave, but could otherwise be done on the go via a ship using the waves to traverse space).\nBorg Transwarp through use of TW coils for independent TW conduit generation seemed quite fast... it allowed the Delta Flyer to traverse 200 Ly's in a few seconds (10, maybe 20 seconds?).\nWe know that when Voyager equipped its engines with 1 Borg TW coil, they traversed 20 000 ly's... although, they didn't say how long it took them to do that... it could be about 33 or 34 minutes (if the above assessment of 200 ly's per 20 seconds is accurate).\nWarp 13\u2026 Was this overlooked?\nIn Star Trek, how fast is warp 9.99?\nWhy did the Star Trek writers decide Warp 10 would be infinite?\nWhy did the Earth stay still in Star Trek: First Contact?\nWhy did warp cores become vertical?\nHow do the sensors in Star Trek receive information faster than light speed?\nWhy was the word \u201cTrek\u201d used in Star Trek?\nWhy call it Star Trek?\nIs Star Trek Online part of the Star Trek universe/timeline?\nDoes the Star Trek `reboot` mean that Star Trek TNG (et. al.) never happened?"

                            "text": "Golfer Greg Norman recommends that golfers begin with some simple golf stretching exercises before progressing to more specific golf stretching exercises. You first need to become limber before you can increase your flexibility relative to your golf swing. Stretching is important for a full, powerful swing, but it also helps as you carry your bag and make your way along the course. Proper flexibility also improves overall health and reduces the chance of injury.\nSimple stretching exercises begin with touching your toes. This is a simple exercise, and many of us did it during P.E. class in elementary school. Stand up straight and bend forward, lowering your hands toward your feet. Stop as soon as you feel the pressure of stretching. Hold for twenty seconds and repeat ten times. Each day you should see an improvement in how far you can bend toward your toes. Once you can touch your toes, try for wrapping your hands behind your ankles and holding for a twenty count. Repeat ten times.\nWhen you have limbered up, begin trying more specific golf stretching exercises. Lie flat on your back with your legs out straight. Bend one knee and pull your foot toward your backside. Hold your bend knee with your clasped fingers and pull your knee toward your chest. Hold for twenty seconds. Repeat with your other knee. Do this stretching exercise ten times per leg. Do not forget to breathe properly while stretching. This stretches your lower back and glutes.\nFor the next stretching exercise, begin in the same position, laying on your back with your legs straight. This time, bend both knees at the same time and clasp your hands behind your thighs. Hold for twenty seconds. Repeat ten times. This exercise stretches your lower back.\nFor upper back golf stretching, get on your all fours as if you are ready to crawl. Bend your elbows, lowering your chest towards the floor. Extend your shoulders and arch your back. Hold twenty seconds and return to the starting position. Repeat ten times.\nStretching your arms and sides is important, as well. Stand straight with your arms above your head. Slowly bend to the side, allowing the weight of your arms to stretch your opposite side. Hold for ten seconds and return to the starting position. Repeat on the other side. Do this exercise twenty times per side.\nWhen you complete these side stretches, hold one arm straight up in the air and bend your elbow until your forearm is behind your head. Grasp the back of your arm with your other hand and pull until you feel tension in your shoulder. Hold for twenty seconds and repeat with your other arm. Repeat this five times on each side.\nBy beginning with simple stretches, you are able to improve your flexibility without injuring yourself. It is always important to stretch before swinging your clubs, but be sure to do these stretches every day even if you do not go to the driving range or golf course. Flexibility builds over time, but you loose it quickly if you do not exercise it regularly."

                            "text": "Edward Bunting (1773-1843) was an organist in Belfast. He was the most important collector of old Gaelic harp music, because he wrote down tunes and information direct from the playing of the last of the old Gaelic harpers.\nIn 1792, Bunting was commissioned by the organisers of the Belfast harpers\u2019 meeting (commonly known now as the Belfast Harp Festival), to write down the old Irish tunes played by the harpers. He was so intruiged by the music played by these elderly harpers that he spent a lot of the rest of his life collecting tunes and information from them across Ireland.\nBunting's working method was to sit down with the harper and make a very rapid draft of the music into his pocket notebook as they played. These first drafts are very messy but seem to be pretty accurate impressions of what the harpers actually played in each performance. Then later, he would transfer the tune across into his desk notebook, tidying it up, and adding basic piano harmonisation and key signature etc. as he did so. The previous draft version would be crossed out in pencil. This procedure (of copying to a new book and adjusting the tune and harmony in the process) could be repeated again and again until Bunting had worked out a romantic piano arrangement to his satisfaction.\nBunting also wrote down a lot of background information from the harpers, some of it scribbled in the margins of his field notebooks, some in the form of letters and other documents.\nBunting\u2019s manuscripts are preserved at Queens University Library, Belfast. They are catalogued as MS4. Each individual item is listed by number, e.g. MS4/29, colloquially known as \u201cmanuscript 29\u201d. There is a catalogue and index by Colette Moloney that numbers every tune in the manuscripts, and references them by folio numbers; however, the Library doesn\u2019t use either of these systems. Some of the manuscripts have page numbers written on the pages; some have more than one set of pagination. So it is very hard to reference a page.\nBunting wrote up his work for publication, and he issued three volumes of piano music each with an introduction describing the music and the collecting. These three books were very influential."

We will examine the difference between the definitions of traitor and trader, where these words came from and some examples of their use in sentences.\nA traitor is someone who betrays his country, his friends, a cause or his principles. A traitor breaches trust in some way or commits treason against his country. Perhaps the most famous traitor of ancient times was Brutus, who betrayed Caesar. The word traitor is derived from the Old French words traitor or traitre, which mean villain, traitor, deceiver. The plural form is traitors.\nA trader is a merchant who buys and sells goods, or a stock broker who buys and sells stocks, currency and bonds. The word trader comes from the Middle Low German word trade, meaning path or track, most probably originally referring to a ship used in trading, along with the suffix -er which means the man who has to do with. The plural form is traders."

They will be throwing everything they have at the president for the next two months before the final bell sounds on Election Day.\nFor over a year the Mueller thugs have been pounding Trump\u2019s body, trying to wear him out before the last two rounds. The coup has sent in a motley team of cowards, liars and traitors to deliver the low blows.\nTraitor, liar and coward Robert Mueller: using illegal, false evidence to become special counsel, refusing to do the task for which he was appointed, launching an all-out attack on anyone connected to Trump who could be used to overthrow him, framing Trump associates with deceit and outright lies, conducting illegal searches of the president\u2019s lawyers and using impermissible, seized evidence, grinding those he could use against the president by threats of additional charges and prison, bankruptcy, destruction of personal reputation, using the threats to force them into making false statement about Trump, coercing guilty pleas from innocent people and then forcing them to cooperate with the coup, illegally releasing grand jury testimony.\nTraitor, liar and coward Rod Rosenstein: orchestrating the Russian investigation by using false documents, paid for by the Clinton machine, to deceive FISA judges into issuing illegal warrants against Trump associates, signing illegal FISA warrants for Trump associates, lying to Congress and to the president.\nTraitor, liar and coward James Comey: lying to the president and Congress, creating elaborate schemes of lies and deceit to entrap Trump associates, using threats and plea bargains to coerce Trump associates into working against him, using ill-gotten evidence to create a secret FBI operation, using the secret operation to help the DOJ build a case for a special prosecutor, leaking the Russian dossier to the media to make sure a special prosecutor would be appointed.\nTraitor, liar and coward Jeff Sessions: lying to the president to become attorney general, turning over the Russian investigation to a Trump-hating special counsel, announcing he will do the same with the Clinton felonies, hindering congressional investigations into the coup, refusing to resign, refusing to fire Rosenstein and Mueller, protecting all of the coup operatives, arresting two key Republican congressmen just before the midterm elections to put their seats in doubt.\nThere are other traitors, liars, and cowards who also slithered into the ring from time to time to deliver their venomous blows. Among these other malcontents: Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, Bruce Ohr, James Clapper, Andrew McCabe, John Brennan.\nDo you think Trump will survive these blows against him?\nNow come the potentially devastating head shots of the championship rounds. The coup is going for a knockout while Trump will try to effectively counter-punch to stay on his feet until the final bell on Election Day.\nFirst into the ring for the coup is the liar and coward Bob Woodward.\n4. Trump said about Jeff Sessions, \u201cThis guy is mentally retarded,\u201d and, \u201ca dumb Southerner,\u201d then mocked the way he talks.\nAll these statements have been denied by those alleged to have said, or witnessed, them.\nThe next liar and coward sent in the ring has no name. The New York Times ran their first anonymous Op-Ed, written, they say, by a senior official in the Trump administration whose name would be readily recognized and whose job would be jeopardized by its disclosure.\nThey also say that doing this is was the only way they could deliver this important perspective to the public.\nIt claims many senior officials in the Trump administration are diligently working to frustrate parts of the president\u2019s agenda and his worst inclinations.\nSpeculation on who the writer is has reached a level of lunacy, even including Ivanka Trump and Kellyanne Conway.\nThe Op-Ed tears into Trump in a myriad of ways, clearly designed to do severe damage to him and his presidency. These members of the Resistance were, without a doubt, recruited by the coup.\nAccording to the anonymous writer, the Resistance\u2019s goal is to preserve the country\u2019s democratic institutions and thwart Trump\u2019s misguided impulses which are anti-trade and anti-democratic.\nThis is a hard and painful headshot landed on the president but, being the fighter he is, he immediately counterpunched this sniveling coward without a name.\nThese are the coup\u2019s opening head shots in the championship rounds. There are many more coming, each with increasing intensity.\nLook for the final, and hardest, shot to be thrown, moments before the final bell, to deny the president the opportunity to counterpunch before the decision is rendered.\nAfter the final bell, the voters will announce the decision and raise the winner\u2019s hand \u2014 possibly sealing the fate of the country for years to come."

I will be explaining it in 2 parts, here and on \u201cCorner Stone\u201d. This part concerns the fulfillment of prophecy and Christ being the Messiah. And I mention all this here because by John the Baptist preaching about Christ\u2019s coming and in baptizing him, he fulfilled a scripture from Isiah.\n\u201cMany non-Christians who have difficulty accepting that Jesus is God have no trouble professing that Jesus was a great moral teacher. However, this position is not only illogical but impossible. Jesus claimed to be divine, nothing less. If Jesus was not God, he would be far less than just a great, moral teacher; he would be deluded, or a deceiver. There would be nothing great about the teaching of a man who merely pretended to be God. His teachings, if believed, would steer people away from the truth. Jesus can not be regarded as a great teacher, but no divine. There are only 3 options as to who Jesus was in light of his claims.\n1. Deity\u2014 His message should be believed and trusted.\n2. Deceiver\u2014His message is that of a false, religious teacher. Jesus tricked people into following him.\n3. Deluded\u2014 Jesus was simply a mentally ill person who believed that he was really God.\nLet us examine all three.\nOption 1: Jesus was a Deceiver.\nThis option holds that Jesus was a liar and willfully deceived people about religious truth. Jesus certainly could not be regarded as a great, moral teacher if her were found to be a pathological liar. Jesus would be a hypocrite of the highest order, instruction his followers in honesty and virtue while he lived out a religious deception\u2026 The notion of Jesus willfully perpetuation a religious deception makes no sense. What would Jesus have to gain by such a lie?\u2026 Moreover, if Jesus had been a religious deceiver, he certainly would have changed his store in the face of an impeding death.\nWas Jesus merely a sincere person who mistakenly thought he was God? \u2026 Jesus never displayed such characteristics. In Jesus, we find one of the greatest intellects in all of history having total control of his mind and actions. His words not only had a profound influence of ht people of his day, but they also continue to improve the lives of men and women today. \u2026 Such a man does not fit the psychological profile of a deluded person."

                            "text": "The British allege that Skripal a double agent was infected with nerve gas on orders of Putin.\nThe world of spies and secret agents is thrilling but laced with danger. An example of a superspy is the agent James Bond created by the writer Ian Fleming. He is supposed to be the man with the license to kill.Many films on the subject have come from Hollywood.\nThere is a flip side to this story, and when an agent becomes a traitor and betrays his country and runs away to a friendly country, the former country will like to punish him as an example to others. BBC has reported that Sergei Skripal a double agent who reportedly betrayed tens of Russian agents in Europe was poisoned by a nerve gas on the orders of the Kremlin.\nThe British foreign secretary Boris Johnson has gone one step further and said the poisoning of the double spy was probably on orders of the Russian President Vladimir Putin. There is no evidence to corroborate his accusation, but it is within the realm of possibility that the Russian secret police may have had a hand in eliminating Skripal so as to make him an example to other agents, who may be thinking of defecting to the west.\nA war of words has erupted between Britain and Russia, and both countries have expelled diplomat from each other's embassies.\nThe British reaction looks a little strange and is perhaps an attempt to deflect from their failure to give security to an agent who had defected to them. It was incumbent on the British Intelligence and government to safeguard the Russian spy who defected.Unfortunately, they failed, and the Russian spy was poisoned with a rare gas and most likely may not survive. His daughter who was with him has also suffered the same fate.\nThe CIA and British intelligence have also acted in a similar fashion and people who have betrayed the British have been jailed for life.\nMany of the British agents escaped to Russia when their cover was blown. Similarly, Russian agents have fled after they were discovered. Reports suggest that Skripal betrayed many secret agents operating in Europe and the UK. He was thus a marked man, and the British knew that the Russians would be after him.\nIt is not understood why he was not given protective custody or may be sent across to the United States.Spies look romantic and macho, but in real term, they are just ordinary humans.\nMany of them are caught in a web of circumstances over which they have no control, and many are forced to become double agents for no fault of theirs.\nA spy who works for an enemy is never forgiven, and this should have been the guiding principle for British intelligence. That they failed will remain a black mark on them."

                            "text": "Some friends and I have been planning a collaborative project for some time now, and it is finally time to put pen to paper and begin the first steps towards a unique journey through cultural history. The idea is to all create pieces of a culture using traditional craftsmanship, starting with a map (that I will draw), and then forge/craft pieces of the heritage relating to that region such as axes, tool chests, locks, knives, etc. I will be doing the maps all by hand with quill and ink on either parchment or hand made paper. Having never mapped with a quill before, I thought I would take the time to practise before doing anything really time consuming and meant for distribution. Although the ink I used was supposed to be waterproof, it was not, so the sealing of the paper resulted in quite a bit of smearing, so I will be getting a different type next time.\nThis began, as I usually do, with a general, low detail pencil drawing to work out what it will look like and make any small adjustments before using the ink.\nThe elder futhark runes simply read 'Isarn Project' spelled phonetically, as would have been done back in that Age.\nBeing left handed makes me take much more caution and consideration to what I am doing, an more than once I lost sight of how long it takes ink to dry. Fortunately, the smudges were in places where I could mostly hide them behind fresh ink.\nThe level of detail possible with a quill is astounding, although it is difficult at times to prevent lines from bleeding together or drawing excess ink out through surface tension.\nMy goal with this piece was not necessarily to make a map, but to survey all the different elements I use in cartography and see the differences between the techniques I used in the past and how they changed with a quill in hand.\nBecause it takes so long for the ink to dry and I do not have a sand jar (yet), I had to draw this over the course of several days, taking sections at a time and working right to left so as to avoid destroying everything I just drew.\nSome things, like mountains and the shoreline are easier with a quill, while others, like forests and cities/buildings are far more difficult. This has certainly been a learning process, there is no doubt about that.\nContrary to most popular literature, there is a very low risk of errant droplets or splatters landing on the paper. Perhaps with a cut feather quill it would be different, but this steel nib from Italy when my folks travelled there a few months back is very clean and smooth.\nIn the trees is where the lines were most likely to bleed together. When dipping the quill back into the ink, the first few strokes are much thicker, and as a result the tiny circle tree shapes close into black dots unless extreme care is taken to avoid drawing lines next to each other for a few seconds.\nAnd finally the finished piece. This is before the paper was sealed. Nothing spectacular, but an eye opening experience.\nDespite the claims that this ink was waterproof and permanent, it was obviously not. Most notably along the left coastline and trees, the ink began to bleed and smear. It is, unfortunately, one of those learning points that comes when it is too late to do anything about it. I will be replacing my generic ink that I found in the attic a few months back with India ink, which I trust well above this to perform and dry permanently.\nThanks, I appreciate the kind words! Soon I will be drawing the actual map for the project and I will likely be posting it as a work in progress."

                            "text": "A Sofer, using a pen, will shape letters as he applies ink to the parchment, one at a time. The same scribe does the same thing on masse by pushing ink through a Silk Screen and then pushing those letters onto the parchment. Rabbi Abadi, a well known and highly accomplished Posek, greatly praised by some of the greatest rabbis of the previous generation encourages this method for producing Sifrey Torah.\nRabbi Abadi was born in Venezuela and moved at a very young age, together with his parents, back to Tiberias. He learned in Yeshivat Chevron in Jerusalem. At the age of 19, the \"Chazon Ish\" sent him to study in Lakewood, NJ, under the famed Rabbi Aharon Kotler.\nRabbi Abadi is a renowned Posek whose students are accomplished rabbis across the globe.\nRabbi Abadi was the leading Posek for the entire Lakewood community.\nIn 1980 Rabbi Abadi opened a Halacha Kollel in Lakewood, transferring it in 1993 to Har Nof, Jerusalem and has since moved back to Lakewood NJ 2009.\nOur most sacred treasure is constructed from the most ordinary materials. Taking something that has almost no value and imbuing it with sanctity is a message for life, and the manner in which we can and should elevate even our most ordinary activities.\nA Sefer Torah, the five books of Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy) in which are included The Ten Commandments, are the words of G-d dictated to Moses on Mount Sinai, in plain view of all 12 Tribes, the Sons of Israel. It is the most sacred of secrets, the DNA of our identity and the map of our destiny. We cherish, honour and show obeisance to these words of G-d written on plain parchment, applied with archaic goose feathers, using plain ordinary ink and drawn without pretence, sophistication or embellishments. Its focus is entirely on the message of its 304,805 letters its sparse and cryptic words and their interpretation.\nWe say that Moses conversed with the G-d, as would two friends. In spite of this, Moses is known as the humblest of men. Perhaps we should not say, \u201cin spite of this\u201d but \u201cbecause of this\u201d. Humility is the only device that will permit the removal of those obstacles that impede our soul\u2019s urge to commune with G-d. The Torah testifies, \u201cMoses was the most humble of all people\u201d and precisely because of Moses\u2019 humility could he and did he utterly embrace and unreservedly bond with G-d.\nThose letters are described by our Sages OBM, as leaping letters of flames. They are like flames that appear to reach ever upwards in their attempt to escape this world and ascend to a higher sphere but are held unwillingly in check by their earthly anchor.\nEach of its 304,805 letters is composed of several precisely made strokes. A Sofer draws for example, a \u2018yod\u2019 (\u05d9) as a short vertical stroke; if is lengthened it becomes \u2018vav\u2019 (\u05d5) by extending the head, a \u2018resh\u2019 (\u05e8) is formed, and if the \u2018resh\u2019 has a flat baseline added to it and a short riser it is transformed into a \u2018mem\u2019(\u05dd).\" All 27 letters are formed with only a few strokes again emphasizing the simplicity of the Torah. There is beauty not in the letters but in the Sofer. The persistence and diligence required both to train and in the actual execution when writing any of the sacred texts is a revelation of the nobility, diligence and beauty within the Sofer. But they must be consistent. The best quality Torahs are those where the lettering is consistent, achieved by practicing the same stroke over and over again.\n\"Imagine a bar mitzvah boy or girl coming up for the first time to read the Torah and the \u2018bet\u2019 (\u05d1) in \u2018Bereishit\u2019 (In the beginning, G-d) doesn\u2019t look the same as the \u2018bet\u2019 (\u05d1) in. \"barah\" (create) They\u2019re nice, very artistic, but they\u2019re not consistent.\"\nThese letters are written on parchment, not paper or plastic or cloth. Cloth could be made that would mimic parchment so well that no one but G-d and the user, would know the difference. \"If it\u2019s not made out of parchment, it\u2019s not a Sefer Torah.\"\nSaddam Hussein attempted to gather all the Sifrey Torah he possibly could and destroy them all. However, one of the officers involved in storing the Torahs slated for destruction realized that a lot of money could be made by selling them to the people who so treasure them.\nA sample section of parchment was shown to Rabbi Mordecai Eliyahua, an Iraqi who was a former chief rabbi and one of the leading Torah scholars. He wept upon seeing this scrap of parchment and the ancient lettering inscribed upon it. He knew exactly where it came from and saw the hundreds of years of history it had witnessed.\nThe Torahs were saved, smuggled to safety within the inner tubes of truck tires. And another chapter was added to their and our history.\nHowever, they wanted a million dollars for each Sefer Torah. \"We would not pay more than its worth; we had to avoid creating an incentive for stealing Sifrey Torah. How does one persuade gangsters that the Seforim are not so valuable? Point to some of the gaps and complain that parts are missing.\nA million dollars is a lot of money to pay for something made of calf\u2019s skin, wasp nests and honey; some of the basic materials used for making a Torah.\nIt takes approximately 80 skins to make one Sefer Torah.\nTorahs are made of parchment because that\u2019s what the law says they must be made from. Nowadays, the most commonly used parchment for Torahs comes from unborn calves; foetuses from cows slaughtered for food. Torahs in the Middle East were written on parchment that came from goats. Cow skin can not be used for Torahs (though it is used for Tefilin), because it is too thick. However, calves\u2019 skin as well as sheepskin and deerskin have all been used. Deerskin was very popular; in fact it is probably the best skin to use because it\u2019s very difficult to remove the ink. In Europe there are Torahs where the hunter\u2019s bullet hole is still in the Torah.\nGoatskin is strongly marked with dark patches for which a white \"paint\" was developed to cover the parchment. Unfortunately, the paint tends to crack, which in turn cracks the ink and thus invalidates the Torah.\nThe comfort of the congregation has not been to the advantage of their Sifrey Torah. The heating and cooling being activated and de-activated, causes expansion and contraction which tends to crack the ink. High to moderate humidity promotes the growth of moulds. For this reason it is also advantageous to have the Sifrey Torah \u201crolled\u201d on a regular basis to give them an opportunity to \u201cbreathe\u201d.\nThe National Museum of Sweden kept a Sefer Torah in its vaults for more than 100 years. However, when the museum permitted the Torah to be authenticated by Rabbi Yitzchak Shteiner, he informed them that what they were protecting so dearly, was not a Torah. Because it had not been used, most of the letters of the Torah had flaked off.\nThe raw animal skin is put in a large tumbler with a lime solution for up to eight hours to remove all of the hair and degrease it. The skin is then scraped to remove any left over hair or fat, stretched on a frame and allowed to dry slowly. When dry it is called \"klaf\" and cut into rectangles.\nNow the layers of the dried skin are split into the epidermis (outer layer) and the dermis (inner layer). The parchment used for Sifrey Torah, teffilin and mezuzahs comes from the inner side of the epidermis.\n42 horizontal faint lines are impressed into the parchment. There are also two vertical lines to mark the margins between the columns of print. These margins, by tradition, are five fingers wide. Unlike our method of writing on top of the line, soferim hang their writing from the line above. Also, each letter is formed from left to right, though Hebrew is read from right to left.\nIn the earliest times, bamboo shoots were used as writing tools and are still used by some.\nIn Europe the preferred tools were goose feathers. There are enough quills in one goose to write an entire Sefer Torah. Duck and chicken feathers are too small, they don\u2019t hold enough ink. One of the first things a sofer learns is how to prepare a quill. A pocket must be created in the quill to hold enough ink to write G-d\u2019s name. It may be written only in outline and filled in afterwards, but the name of G-d must be written with one load of ink. If too large a pocket is made the ink can easily slip out of the quill and make an unholy mess. A slit in the quill promotes even ink flow but most important of all is the penmanship of the sofer. Of course his talent is reflected in the artistic quality of the letter\u2019s shape but it also determines how well the quill behaves. In the hands of a novice the quill is device that makes messes and causes frustrations, in the hands of an accomplished sofer it is a tool of wonderful value.\nInk is made of four ingredients. Gallnut (an excretion produced by some plants when irritated by the larvae of gall wasps. Oak trees are the major commercial source of medicinal gallnuts. The plant secretes the liquid gall, comprised mainly of tannins, that hardens to become the \"nut\". Gallnut extracts are widely used in pharmaceuticals, food and feed additives, dyes, inks, and metallurgy), which is pulverised and mixed with water.\nTo that is added gum base from the acacia tree. This is to give elasticity to the dried ink. This is most important because it makes the dried ink elastic which prevents it cracking when the Sefer Torah or mezuzah is rolled. Some recipes did not use sufficient or substituted poor quality elasticisers with very unfortunate results.\nAccording to the law, the ink has to be black like a raven and this is achieved by adding magnesium or copper sulphate crystals. Occasionally in very old Sifrey Toarh the ink has oxidized, a natural reaction through exposure to oxygen in the air, which turns the ink brownish red. In this case it is still Kosher but if after only a short time the colouring changes, the ink is faulty and the sefer is probably not Kosher.\nHoney is sometimes added to thicken the mixture, and on another dimension this symbolises the sweetness of the Torah. Some have a tradition of adding a concoction made from the seven special species which the Holy Land is blessed with: pomegranates, dates, figs, barely, olives, wheat, and grapes.\nInk is usually prepared in small batches to ensure that it is fresh.\nThere are exactly 248 columns in a Sefer Torah. This is a very special number: it reflects on the human being that has 248 limbs as enumerated in the Mishnah of Ohalos; it reflects on the positive commandments of the Torah and it reflects upon Avraham whose name matches that numerical value. Also, in every Sefer Torah the columns begin and end with the same word.\nSifrey Torah must not be written from memory but copied word for word from another scroll called a Tikkun. Many soferim sing each letter out loud as they write it.\nDavidovitch is a famous name amongst the soferim. He wrote a Tikkun to make the columns look more evenly spaced with each column accommodating 62 average letters. Some lines have fewer letters, some have more and both are so marked in his Tikkun. This is very helpful for the sofer who must either make the letters a little wider or narrower to fill the line and make it look comfortably fitted.\nThere are three different traditions of writing, Ashkenazi, Sephardi and Hasidic. Most of the differences tend to be about the slant or artistic form of the letters.\nIn 1944, that mad dog of infamy, opened a museum in Prague, which documented the planned soon to be extinct Jewish race. The Czech government invited some rabbis to inspect some of the artefacts that had been collected there. There were many Sifrey Torah, six to seven hundred years old and all written in the Sephardi tradition. It is believed that these Torahs originate from the Jewish expulsion from Spain in 1492.\nThere are only seven letters with slight variations that separate the Ashkenazi and Sephardic traditions.\nA sofer is not just a copyist. He attains a state of mind and heart that connects him with his creator and this Torah that is the conduit between HaShem and His Holy People. A Sefer Torah is going to be part of a congregation\u2019s life for the next 300 years.\nA sofer requires three basic skills; how to write the letters, the laws governing the formation of the letters (about 4,000) and how to focus ones mind and heart to be truly connected to Gd.\nAside from keeping kosher and strictly observing all the holy days, every morning the sofer should go to the mikvah (ritual bath). When he sits down to write he must actually say \"For the sanctity of the Torah Scroll.\"\nSince women are not obligated in the Mitzvah of writing a Sefer Torah they are not permitted to write them. Women\u2019s participation in Jewish rituals is a matter of choice, not an obligation.\nIf a mistake is made when writing the letters in a word, the letters must be removed and rewritten. Sometimes a scalpel is used to chip and scrape the letters off the parchment. This method is more commonly used to restore an old Sefer Torah when the letters are flaking off from age.\nHowever, if a mistake is made in writing G-d\u2019s name which may never be erased, the parchment bearing the name of G-d must be cut out and a patch glued in its place.\nAccording to some traditions, the entire column is removed and replaced.\nSifrey Torah are checked three to seven times for errors. This is done by one person reading aloud each one of the 304,805 letters from an established Tikkun whilst another checks it on the Torah.\nAfter the text is written, the parchment sections have to be sewn together into a roll with thread made from the leg sinews of kosher animals.\nThe completed Sefer Torah is sewn onto sticks, \"Atzei Chayim\" (trees/branches of life), in the Sephardic tradition, they are situated inside a beautifully decorated hard case. The Ashkenazi tradition has a soft cover placed over the parchment and sticks.\nSome years ago, the Israeli Police Department and Interpol consulted with various rabbis to develop a method to positively identify Sifrey Torah without marking them and thereby stem the increasing trade in stolen Sifrey Torah. Since Sifrey Torah are hand written, each is slightly different. This allows the police to keep \u201cfingerprints\u201d of all Sifrey Torah on a database. Since these \u201cfingerprints\u201d are unknown to the thief, they are unable to simply replace a known section to change the \u201cfingerprint\u201d.\nThe final Mitzvah of the Torah is to write a Sefer Torah. Each and every Jew has an obligation to write Sefer Torah."

Although Thomas Lemuel Oates started Manual Woodworkers and Weavers in 1932, the story goes back further. The roots of the company can be found in Oates' entrepreneurial spirit. He and his brother used to farm the mountain areas of Bat Cave in western North Carolina. They would also help their mother find materials for her crafts. The sons began to make wooden whistles, buckets and bird-houses. They would sell their wares along with her crafts to the people from Charlotte that came through in their horse-drawn buggies on the way to the mountains. Later, Thomas worked at the Ashville Postcard Company. When the Depression hit, he lost his job, but it inspired him to go into business and sell crafts, like cornhusk dolls and woven pieces, that were produced by the local women. He had learned about the wholesale business while working at Ashville. He built a waterwheel to generate electricity at a mill, began making product and opened shop. Over the years, he expanded the company. His son, Lemuel Oates, who would next manage the company, says he worked in the business from a young age. He explains the products were made from cotton scraps left over from making socks. Half-inch circles would be looped together to form a variety of products. Lemuel Oates went to college and then settled in Richmond. In December 1973, he returned to Bat Cave and took over the company. In 2007 his son Travis and his daughter, Molly Oates Sherrill, took over the business."

                            "text": "If you have ever tried to repair or fix anything over the last decade, you know the struggle. Nothing today is made to be fixed or restored; its meant to be replaced. Metal can be bent back, plastic is bent to break! Anyone like me can go online and get replacement parts, but it takes a person of skill and understanding to restore. Restoration is a process for a craftsman.\nAccording to Proverbs 8.22-26, Wisdom was acquired from God, installed from eternity, and in a intimate relationship with Him.\nAccording to Proverbs 27-29, Wisdom was with God during creation.\nWisdom was a craftsman. As discussed prior, Wisdom is simply \u201cability\u201d. The first men in Scripture to have been given wisdom were not preachers or priests, they were: tailors (Exodus 28.3); workers in metal (Exodus 31.2-3); women who spun cloth (Exodus 35.26-27); stone cutters, wood workers, and embroiderers (Exodus 35.30-36.3). One of Paul\u2019s teachings, who himself had some ability and wisdom as a tent maker (Acts 18.3), from 1 Thessalonians 4 is quite applicable here: \u201cMake it your ambition to lead a quiet life, to mind your own business, and to work with your hands\u2026\u201d (11) That is a life of wisdom\u2026that is a proverbial life.\nI come from a family of craftsman. My first job was framing houses for my uncle Jim. He was a good first boss because he knew how limited my ability was . We were putting on a porch one day at a house up off 90th street. It was Friday afternoon and it was coming on quitting time. The porch was a full wrap around with tongue and groove slats. Right at the corner of the house, it came off at a 45-degree angle to meet with the adjacent run of porch. As we set the decking, I found myself nearest the wall and reading measurements to the saw man. Very patiently and calmly, after 2-3 meaurements, my uncle Jim stood up, walked over and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you switch me ends before you ruin your weekend?\u201d Craftsmanship done by a master craftsman is a thing to behold. My uncle Joe and uncle Charlie can make any engine run. My dad can read terrain and build maps with the best. My uncle Chuck replaces windows and siding. Uncle Mick can build websites. I think I can still do Macaroni art.\nWisdom is the master Craftsman of creation. He is the hands that would do the building.\nThe last section of Proverbs 8 to consider is verse 32 and those that follow. A lot is known about a person by what they come bearing. I always tell first time conference presenters to bring a handout. It may have taken you 2 minted to type and make 40 copies of, but your audience interprets it as hours more of prep work. When I was in youth ministry, I would always show up to games with a Gatorade for the student. It was a dollar and a minute out of the way, but it communicated to them that I actually cared and prepared.\nLife is about doing the things God created you to do and being who he created to be. This is only accomplished by finding and attaining wisdom.\nAs for \u201cfavor\u201d, as discussed briefly in a previous post, Noah found \u201cfavor\u201d [chen] or \u201cgrace\u201d in the eyes of the Lord. That would fit perfectly here. The problem is that it is not the same Hebrew word. Same english translation but a different Hebrew word. Instead, it is a word used of sacrifices to obtain acceptability with God. The word is ratson and it is used throughout Leviticus to show show God\u2019s acceptance of our offerings.\nBy seeking and finding Wisdom, we get life and acceptance to the Lord.\nPracticality is a word that is sacred among ranches. The simplest way to do something is always valued. When dealing with 1500 lbs animals, refurbished equipment, or hand me down tools, simple is always better. Murphy\u2019s law, \u201cif it can go wrong, it will go wrong\u201d is offset by Okham\u2019s razor, \u201cthe simplest solution is usually the correct one.\u201d That is why a horse, a saddle, and a rope is still relevant amidst a world that is mechanized.\nProverbs is the horse, saddle, and rope book of the Bible. Set among the backdrop of the elegant poetry and beautiful worship compositions of the Psalms, the creative angst and despair of Ecclesiastes, the romance of Song of Solomon, or the deep questions posed by Job, Proverbs is just a down to earth, practical application of the best way to live life. There isn\u2019t a lot of hidden meaning or deep interpretation that needs to be done. It is a book of simplicity that cuts out all the excess. That\u2019s the kind of life we need more of today.\nAs part of the wisdom literature (as is the aforementioned 4 books), Proverbs is all about attaining wisdom. Wisdom is the application of knowledge. It was Bezalel, who was given \u201cwisdom\u201d [chokmah] to build the Tabernacle in Exodus 31. It was not just that he had the mental and theoretical understanding of what to build; his hands were able to accomplish the task. I can give you all the theory on how to shoe a horse; but when it comes down to using a hoof knife, I\u2019m worthless. Wisdom is knowledge getting its hands dirty. Wisdom is knowledge in action. Proverbs is all about living life well, by putting knowledge into action: wisdom. Just over 25% of the times this word, chokmah, \u201cwisdom\u201d is used in the Old Testament, it is used in the book of Proverbs.\nBut wisdom in middle of Proverbs seems take on person-hood: \u201cshe\u201d stands and calls out\u201d (8.2-3); \u201cI\u201d raise my voice (8.4); \u201cI, wisdom, dwell\u201d (8.12); \u201cI walk\u201d (8.20) and so many more. The classification of wisdom as the female gender, has nothing to do with with the person-hood of wisdom. In the same way that the greek word for wisdom, sophia, is feminine in person, the Hebrew word, chokmah, is a feminine word as are many abstract words in the Hebrew language.\nThree things about Wisdom in this first section. First, when the Lord \u201cbrought him forth\u201d, the initial thought was that Wisdom was a created entity. The hebrew word qanah can be used of creation, however, much more common is the meaning \u201cto aquire\u201d or \u201cto buy\u201d. Proverbs 4.5-7 uses the word 4 times in 3 verses and not once does it even hint at creation. The word qanah (to acquire) and its homophone (to create) and the confusion between the two, would provide the interpretation that gave rise to the heretical movement of Arianism and its teaching that Jesus was a created being, not to be equated with God. The Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\u2019 would follow this teaching as well.\nThe second issue raised is the \u201cformation\u201d of Wisdom. Theses verse fall into Hebrew poetry structure of parallelism. There are three ways that Hebrew poetry is structured: 1) parallelism, where the second line repeats the idea of the previous; (2) antithetic, where the second line argues against the first; (3) synthetic, where the second line completes or builds upon the first. Verse 23 is in parallel to verse 22. It is conveying the same idea. Wisdom was appointed, the most recent NIV translation says \u201cformed\u201d, from eternity. The hebrew word, nasak, \u201cappoint/formed\u201d is also used in Psalm 2.6 speaking of a king being \u201cinstalled\u201d in his kingdom.\nFinally, verses 24 and 25 says that Wisdom was \u201cgiven birth\u201d prior to the hills and and the oceans. Once again, was Wisdom a created being or eternal? \u201cTo give birth\u201d would argue a beginning of Wisdom; but this is a complex word. The word is chil. The most common use of the word is used to mean \u201ctremble\u201d, \u201cwound\u201d, or \u201cwrithe\u201d (that would be the Qal stem in Hebrew). This usage in 24 and 25 is the Pual stem. It means an intensive action. Simply put, the qal stem is intensified. Instead of \u201che killed\u201d the same word becomes \u201che slaughtered.\u201d As it pertains to our discussion, chil becomes \u201cgive birth\u201d. Speaking from ignorance, I hear that giving birth is way worse than a paper cut. The word is used 7 times in this sense. Twice it is used in abstract: \u201cThe Lord twists the oaks\u201d (Ps. 29.9) and \u201cnorth wind brings rain\u201d (Proverbs 25.23). It is doubtful that would be the intention here. Elsewhere, God has brought forth the Israelite\u2019s (Dt. 32.18) and the world (Psalm 90.2). The metaphor is vital to our doctrine of God. He does not literally give birth, but he can act as a father. Which brings us to the final usage which means literally \u201cto give birth\u201d like the doe and fawn (Job 39.1) and Sarah giving birth. (Isaiah 51.2) Abraham was the father, but Sarah gave birth. God didn\u2019t literally give birth to Wisdom, did not give rise to it, but he was connected to it. The father-son relationship is the intention of the Hebrew verb here. God relationship to Wisdom is fatherhood.\nSo according to Proverbs 8.22-26, Wisdom was acquired from God, installed from eternity, and in a intimate relationship with Him.\nThe second section to look at, verses 27-29, describes Wisdom\u2019s presence at creation. Wisdom was there when God caused \u201cthe heavens to be set in place\u201d. (8.27) Wisdom was present when the waters of the ocean were laid out, when the clouds were established, and when the deeps were dug out. Wisdom didn\u2019t come about during creation; Wisdom was there in creation. Wisdom wasn\u2019t a by product of creation; Wisdom produced creation. Wisdom had its working gloves on during the creation event. The knowledge of God in action.\nSo Wisdom was with God during creation.\nShe was whisked away as fast as she entered in chapter 12. She was a blip on Solomon\u2019s radar; but King Lemuel, he took some time to dwell on her. The structure of the end of Proverbs is unique in its formation. Two things make it stand out from the rest of the book.\nFirst, it is a unit. For much of Proverbs, aside from pieces here and there, the author makes statements that stand on their own. The prologue to the book (1.1-9) and Wisdom\u2019s Poem (8-9) being the obvious exemptions. For much of the book it is stuff like you find in chapter 10. Its a couple verses about obtaining wealth (10.2-5ish); the way to walk (6-9); thoughts on the tongue (10-14); then back to the wealth (15-16); verse 17 is an outlier; then back to the tongue (18-21); the wicked and the righteous (22-30); and finishes with the tongue again (31-32). If you have ever tried to outline the book of James or even the Sermon on the Mount by Jesus, you would know the frustration of trying to put an outline to the book of Proverbs. The themes bounce around, into and off of each other like particles at the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland. But not in this chapter and not for King Lemuel.\nLemuel wants to dwell on this topic of the Woman of Noble Character. It is shown in the number of verses she has devoted to her. Twenty-one verses are devoted to describing her character, her worth, her activity. I guess it depends on how you divide it up and how you categorize and group them, but there aren\u2019t many topics that warrant the amount of ink as the wife of noble character. Wisdom, Righteousness, Discipline, Money are on the short list that get more press than her.\nIts not only the number of verses he devotes to her, it\u2019s the way he arranges them. The end of Proverbs 31 is an acrostic poem. Each subsequent verse begins with the next letter of the Hebrew alphabet. He begins in verse 10 with the letter aleph: \u201c\u2018isha-chayil\u201c. The translation is \u201ca wife/woman of noble character\u201d. The use of \u2018isha in scripture is a bit ambiguous. Going back to a previous post of first text principle in Genesis 2.23-25. The word is used 4 times in four verses; once in 22, 23, 24, and 25. The first two times the NIV translates it as woman, and the last two wife. To say that this only applies to a married woman, rendering \u2018isha as wife, would, I think be hermeneutically arrogant. I would feel safer applying this to all women.\nThe second word of that first verse chayil is an interesting word. It is most commonly translated as \u201carmy\u201d or \u201cwealth\u201d. If you remember from the last post, the word for \u201chelper\u201d [\u2018ezer] has military implications. Those are the literal translations. The meaning, the thought, behind the word is \u201cstrength\u201d. Kings are only as strong as their armies and their wealth. Joel and Habakkuk knew the meaning of this word. Habakkuk writes: \u201cThe Lord is my strength [chayil]\u2026\u201d (Hab. 3.19) and Joel adds: \u201cThe Lord thunders at the head of his armies [chayil]\u201d (Joel 2.11).\nMoving on the second verse (11) beings with batach\u2026the hebrew letter bet, translated as \u201ctrust\u201d. The following verse begins with a gimel. The hebrew word is \u201cgemalathu\u201d meaning \u201cshe will give\u201d. Hebrew (and greek for that matter) is not as confined to sentence structure as the English language is. English sentences are usually constructed as \u201csubject-verb\u201d. The components are generally determined by their location in the sentence. Hebrew, on the other hand uses suffixes to words to denote their function in the sentence. That being said, the order of the sentence is not nearly as important in the Hebrew. King Lemuel utilizes this freedom. He begins verse 10 with noun-adjective; verse 11 with verse-preposition-verb; verse 12 with a verb\u2026and so on.\nHe continues throughout the Hebrew alphabet, all the way through too \u201ctav\u201d. Twenty two letters (or 21 if you combine the letters sin and shin, which are used interchangeably as the Psalmist in 119 does as does King Lemuel) leading the verses about the woman/wife of noble character. Psalm 119 is the perfect example of this. Most NIV Bible\u2019s even begin the sections with the Hebrew letter that will lead the sentence in the subsequent sections.\nWhen\u2019s the last time you composed a poem? Haiku\u2019s not included. Have you ever tried to sit down and write one? Forget a poem. Just try a word. On the left side of a piece of paper, write the alphabet vertically with one line per letter. See if you can come up with something that starts with that letter using a theme. Pick one: animal, college, chemical element, or food. See how long it takes.\nI wrote one about Taco Bell (An Ode to Taco Bell). It took me a while during last summer. To get the right words, in the correct order, to convey the meaning, to clarify thought, was a stressful and intellectually challenging endeavor\u2026and it was about Taco Bell, something so insignificant. Can you imagine, King Lemuel agonizing over the proper words to get his point across? Can you picture, King Lemuel, being poured into by the Holy Spirit, and the words flowing from his pen as he describes the heroine of the story?\nThe woman of noble character was worth all of the effort. All of the time spent describing her was worth spending.\nJust like Jacob, who worked 7 years for Rachel\u2019s hand in marriage but they only seemed like a few days because of his love for her. (Gen. 29.20) Ask him if it was worth it?\nKing Lemuel would answer the affirmative. Most certainly yes! She is worth it. That is why he composes this poem to her honor.\nAnother character that comes to the forefront of the text of Proverbs is \u201cThe Wife of the Nobel Man\u201d. She is mentioned throughout the book, referenced again and again, but is dwelt upon at the end of the book in chapter 31.\nShe bursts on the scene in chapter 12 where we find that she is the\u201d crown of her husband!\u201d (Proverbs 12.4) The Jews had a principle of interpretation called \u201cFirst Text Principle\u201d. Essentially, it means that when a topic comes up in a text, the interpreter must go back to where the concept is spoken of first in Scripture. For example, when we read from the pen of Paul: \u201cFor it is by grace we are saved, through faith\u2013and this is not from yourselves but the gift of God\u2013not by works, so that no one can boast.\u201d (Ephesians 2.8-9) For a Jewish interpreter their mind would immediately be taken to Genesis 6 and the flood narrative where Noah \u201cfound favor [chen] in the eyes of the Lord\u201d. (Genesis 6.8) The Hebrew word for \u201cfavor\u201d can also be translated as \u201cgrace\u201d. And you know the rest of the story. Noah and his family were saved from the flood waters because of God\u2019s warning and Noah\u2019s belief in that warning.\nFor our purposes and the wife of noble character, the study must begin in Genesis 2 with the first woman and the first wife. Man was alone on the earth and for the first time in the story of God and Man, \u201cit was not good\u201d. (Genesis 2.18) So God made for/from Adam a \u201chelper\u201d [\u2018ezer] for him. This word carries the idea of reinforcements in battle (Psalm 20.2; 121.11-12; Isiah 30.5) Eve was given to Adam in order to come alongside him in ministry and in life. She was to rally to support him. But Eve would be the one to be deceived and handing the fruit to Adam. I\u2019m not absolving Adam, he was right there with her, and as the man should have intervened; however, his \u201chelper\u201d would become his\u2026whatever his anti-helper is.\nThat is the crown that he bears in Proverbs 12.4! The wife of noble character is the crowning achievement of creation and the heroine of the book of Proverbs."

The first three have their parallels in traditional Christian hermeneutics (yet we would probably order them with Remez as third and Derash as second, but that would spoil their mnemonic).\nThis strange verse has been the subject of many fanciful conjectures. Let's see what may lie behind this unusual list of names.\nAgur: From agar, \"to collect.\" \"The collector\" may possibly be a symbolical name, like Ecclesiastes, \"the preacher\" or \"assembler.\" He was the son of Jakeh, a mysterious collector of wise sayings and, ostensibly, inspired counsels to Ithiel and Ucal. The rabbis, according to Rashi and Jerome, interpreted this name as symbolizing Solomon the Koheleth, the preacher or assembler. Solomon had several names: Jedidiah, \"beloved by Jehovah,\" the name which, by the mouth of Nathan, the Lord gave to Solomon at his birth as a token of the divine favor; 1 and possibly Lemuel, \"devoted to God.\"\nFrom \"to collect.\" \"The collector\" may possibly be a symbolical name, like Ecclesiastes, \"the preacher\" or \"assembler.\" He was the son of Jakeh, a mysterious collector of wise sayings and, ostensibly, inspired counsels to Ithiel and Ucal.

Solomon had several names: Jedidiah, \"beloved by Jehovah,\" the name which, by the mouth of Nathan, the Lord gave to Solomon at his birth as a token of the divine favor;and possibly Lemuel, \"devoted to God.\"\nI will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old: Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.\nPsalm 78:2-3 A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels: To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.\nSon of Jakeh: Jakeh, from yaqeh, \"carefully religious,\" \"obedient,\" or \"pious,\" was the father of Agur, and would be, thus, David.\n\"Even the prophecy the man spake\": This is an imputed translation from difficult Hebrew: actually, ha massa (the burden) ne'um (oracle) ha-gebber (the mighty): \"the mighty oracle prophesied\"\nUcal: Ucal may actually be a verb, `ukhal, to be consumed.\nThe words gathered of the wise son of the pious father, the burden (prophecy) of the mighty oracle, that El (God) arrives to be consumed.\nProverbs 30:1 also can be seen as referring to the Cross. Let's examine the next few verses in this light.\nSurely I am more brutish [natural] than any man [ish], and have not the understanding of a man [Adam].\nI neither learned wisdom, nor [yet] have the knowledge of the holy.\nWhile the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, Saying, What think ye of Christ? Whose son is he? They say unto him, The Son of David. He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool? [quoting Psalm 110:1] If David then call him Lord, how is he his son? And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.\nThey couldn't decipher His riddle from Psalm 110. Let's be sure we can!\nIn Proverbs 30:1-5, we actually have a Messianic reference! Clearly the Son of God, yet incarnate, and prophesied to be \"consumed\"! The Word of God is, indeed, inexhaustible! Isn't that what you would expect? A surprise in every \"nook and cranny.\""

                            "text": "The Proverbs 31 description of the virtuous woman is one of the best-known passages in Scripture. What is often overlooked, however, is the origin of the passage. It was written by a king (named Lemuel) who said he learned this wisdom from his mother.\nThis final chapter of Proverbs contains two poems\u2014the Wise King (Proverbs 31:2-9) and the Excellent Wife (Proverbs 31:10-31)\u2014both of which are attributed to King Lemuel, whom ancient Jewish tradition identified as King Solomon, but who is otherwise unknown. If Lemuel is, in fact, Solomon, that means the mother who taught her son these wise sayings about excellent character was Bathsheba\u2014a woman known more for scandal than virtue. Perhaps Bathsheba taught Solomon about his ancestor Ruth (Matthew 1:5-6), who had a spotless reputation, and then Solomon could have penned Proverbs 31:10-31 with Ruth in mind. After all, the passage parallels Ruth's life in many ways.\nRegardless, Scripture does specifically record many instances of Solomon's great respect for mothers and motherhood. For instance, one of the greatest examples of Solomon's wisdom was based on knowing that a mother would never harm her child and would only act in the child's best interest (1 Kings 3:16-28). Throughout the book of Proverbs Solomon frequently advises children to learn from both their parents (Proverbs 1:8; 10:1; 15:20), and he even personifies wisdom itself as a woman (Proverbs 1:20; 3:13-18; 4:5-9; 8:1-9:12).\nFurthermore, Solomon always respected Bathsheba, even bowing in her presence (1 Kings 2:19). Whatever Bathsheba's faults\u2014whether or not she was, in fact, the mother of King Lemuel\u2014she clearly helped her son Solomon become a wise man and great leader."

The words yulqun as-sam`a have also been interpreted to mean, \u201cthey pass on the hearing\u201d (Zamakhshari). The choice of words seems to lend both the meanings at a time. Hence, Mujahid has explained (as in Ibn Jarir) that the Devils drop what they pick up from the heaven into the ears of every sinful dirty liar. Ibn Kathir has a similar explanation.\nAlusi conjectures that it cannot be a matter of surprise that just as the Devils pick up a word, the soul of one of the righteous should occasionally picks up a true word (from the first firmament). His opinion is strengthened by his personal experience. When he was five, he was told to do some revision of his text-book. He told his mother he was not going to do any such thing because the Minister was to be killed tomorrow. No one, of course, took it serious \u2013 not even himself. But next morning the Minister was killed by his own retinue.\n\u201c\u2018The poets, when under inspiration, were believed to be under the power of Jinn. This gave them great distinctions. They were, before Islam, often the leaders and representatives of those tribes. Honour was accorded them not from appreciation of intellectual endowment or of artistic genius but because of their uncanny connection with the supernatural\u2019 (ERE. X., p. 135).\nThe poets, in Arabia, were \u2018the men of knowledge\u2019 for their people. Their incantations held good as oracles, first of all for their several tribes, but no doubt extending their influence often beyond their own particular septs.\u2019 (De Boer, History of Philosophy in Islam, p.2).\nHad Majid not named Arab poets, we would have thought he was taking about modern-day pop-music and the poetry that goes with it. These produce greater devastating effects on modern man (Au.).\n(The above report has been treated as Sahih by Albani: S. Ibrahim).\nMuslim has another report. `Amr bin Shareed reports his father: \u201cOnce I shared a camel\u2019s back with the Prophet. He asked, \u2018Do you know any poetical works of Umayyah b. Salt?\u2019 I said, \u2018Yes.\u2019 He said, \u2018Let\u2019s have it.\u2019 So I recited a verse. He said, \u2018More.\u2019 So I recited another. He said, \u2018More,\u2019 until I recited a hundred verses.\nQurtubi thinks it was Shareed himself and not his father who shared the camel\u2019s back with the Prophet; and that the Prophet listened to that length because Umayyah\u2019s poetry was filled with wisdom.\n164. Whom did they defend? Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah and others have said that the allusion is to the defense of Islam against the poets.\nZamakhshari, Qurtubi, Ibn Kathir and others quote from the Sahihayn and other works: The Prophet said to Hassan b. Thabit, \u201cSatirize them, Jibril is with you.\u201d (In fact, he had got erected a platform for Hassan in his mosque, as reported by Ibn Hisham: Alusi).\nThus, writes Qurtubi, there is good poetry and there is bad poetry. It is bad poetry that is the object of criticism here. The Prophet never discouraged good poetry. How could he when he would hear it recited to him, and men like Abu Bakr said their own poetry? The reports that speak of it in disparaging terms are aimed at bad poets, like the Bedouin whom he called \u2018the Devil\u2019, who was probably singing some uncouth words.\nIs there then upon me for this statement any blame?\nBut for You, then free me from the Fire.\nMusa b. \u2018Uqbah has stated, in his Maghazi, that Ka`b b. Zuhayr recited the poem praising the Prophet inside the mosque. When he reached [certain] lines, the Prophet signaled to the people outside that they could enter to hear him.\n.. the Prophet cast his cloak on him.\u201d (Hence the title of the poem QasidahBurdah. (Seerah by Dr. Mahdi Rizqallah, p. 604; and the translation of Ka`b\u2019s poetry is by A. Guillaume, The Life of Muhammad, with minor variations: Au.)].\nMay I never discover you with your tears dried!\nWhy should you not weep the kindly one?\nWhose bounteous robe covered all men?\nAt the loss of one whose equal will never be found.\nAnd one like him will not be mourned till the day of Judgment.\n[Source: Seerah by Dr. Mahdi Rizqallah, p. 695: Au.].\nWhether it will assemble me and my beloved in the House?\n`Umar sat down there weeping.\nLike the confirmation of Musa and the helper in the manner the two were helped.\nBut the All-overpowering will overpower all.\nThen Hassan b. Thabit sought to respond to Abu Sufyan\u2019s satire, promising that he will do it with skill. The Prophet told him to first consult Abu Bakr, who held mastery in genealogy, so that Hassan did not end up lampooning those he did not intend. He promised him that Jibril was with him.\nAnd Ibn Abi Shaybah preserved on the authority of Ibn Mas`ud that the Prophet said, \u201cSurely, some poetry is wisdom and some talk magic.\u201d (Quote from Shawkani ends here).\nIs in Maysaan, offered drinks in glasses and goblets?\nOur drinking in the ruins of the palaces.\n165. A straightforward verbal translation would be, \u201cto what destination will they turn,\u201d as expressed by Ibn Jarir.\nAnd it is said of Safwan b. Muhriz that when he recited this verse, he cried so much that it was thought his chest will break up."

I spend quite a lot of time weightlifting at the gym so having a massage really helps with my mobility. I would definitely recommend him.\nI genuinely cannot say enough good things about Shem. He is kind, authentic and extremely talented at what he does. I only like to support business owners who I personally like and Shem is no exception. As an RMT myself I tend to critique other therapists performance however with Shem I would not change one single thing. I personally do not like deep pressure and I find that he has excellent instincts in terms of utilizing a pressure for me that is effective as well as very pleasant. I always feel great after our treatments and I will definitely be continuing to see him once a week for a while.\nAngela F. says: Katina gave me a fantastic massage and greatly improved the knife like pain I had in my back. Very professional and very effective. Thank you.\nScott B. says: I went for a first appointment with Kristin for 60 minutes and I will definitely be back. Before the actual massage I liked the consultation we had and felt heard and listened too. Lucky for me I am in relatively good shape so the massage purpose is to add self care and relaxation and I got that at Burrard Health Centre Massage Therapy INC.\nI got a treatment from Tiana for some back pain and she was fantastic. She taught me some stretches to do as well so I could continue to work out the muscle tightness after the appointment. Wouldn\u2019t hesitate to return. Thanks!\nThank you to Brendan, my back and shoulders were so relaxed and supple after the massage. I felt great from head to toe.\nI am a patient who has suffered with rheumatoid arthritis for more than 40 years and now have some significant disability, resulting from deteriorated joints. I have had extensive physiotherapy and RMT treatments over the years, but none were as effective as my first treatment with Shem. Shem maybe can\u2019t totally \u201cfix what is broken\u201d, but he can restore mobility and alleviate pain. I recommend arthritis patients avail themselves of his services and find out for themselves! Visit to remember.\nIt wasn\u2019t my first visit, but this time it was a visit to remember! Came in with a sore neck and headache , left without it! LOL, neck was still on. Shem is a magician. I was very happy with instant relief. Stopped taking pills the same day. will be back again.\nI have been seeing Shem over a number of years. As an older client I have had the opportunity to see other therapists here and in other cities. In all honesty Shem is far superior to any other therapist I have visited. His knowledge, diagnosis and technique are superb. No need to go to anyone else. I will be back.\nI have been treated by Shem quite a few times during last several years. He not only provides excellent massage \u2013 he does much more. As he appears to have perfect knowledge of the human body and the muscles, he uses \u201ccustom tailored\u201d methods of treatment for different problems. He explains, what he is doing and why, and advises about exercises which you can do at home to maintain the benefit of the treatment and continue to improve. Honestly, as long as Shem is available, I would never go to another massage therapist. I greatly recommend him to everybody.\nSimon\u2019s magic hands changed my life!\nMy neck was so sore, I had difficulty moving my head from side to side. After one session with Simon, I felt like a new person, my pain had disappeared \u2013 no more sore neck, nothing.\nI would recommend Simon to you anytime, he is a gem!\nI\u2019ve been having some lower back pain and I went to see Simon. He was amazing, one of the best I\u2019ve ever had! I will be back.\nI had a great treatment with Simon and I felt much better. Simon is very knowledgeable with his work , I would definitely book with him again.\nKristin explains what methods she\u2019s going to use and we discuss my areas of concern on each visit. It\u2019s a very relaxing, caring environment.\nI\u2019ve been going to Shem for a few years & he is absolutely the best RMT there is. Some of my most enjoyable moments are my massages with Shem. I am constantly amazed by his talent of finding my knots & sore spots that even I was unaware of. You\u2019re the best!\ni liked being able to make a booking through the internet, but when i went back a few hours later to adjust the time of the appointment, the system seemed to be much clunkier, in the end i left the appt. for what it was.\ni am already recommending you to other people.\nI\u2019ve been to many RMTs for my neck and shoulder pain but Shem is the best RMT I\u2019ve been to. He relieved me of my pain in my shoulder area and knows exactly how to treat my pain. I highly recommend him to anyone.\nThe massage was great. Shem really focused on the sore areas of my back and let me know what he was doing and why during the treatment which I appreciated. I will be back.\nThanks again Shem. You really got me feeling better after my bike wipe out!\nShem, you are the best, there is nobody else who can take away the dull ache from my neck and right shoulder like you do.I have tried acupuncture, candling, more \u2026, nothing works as well. I know I can count on you to make me feel all better.\nI had a massage with Shem prior to going on a 14 hr flight. I have chronic neck and back pain. He relieved my headache and gave me a lot of freedom of movement in both my neck and back, so the flight was fine. Highly recommend.\nShem is very knowledgeable and professional. Significant difference in neck and shoulders already. Thanks and see you next time.\nThank you Shem! I wish I had found you sooner. I felt great right after my appointment and even better the next day. My shoulders thank you. For a sports type massage it was excellent\u2026\u2026I will see you again soon. C.\nI am very happy to have been referred to this massage clinic. Not only is it at a convenient location for me but I was very happy withKristin\u2018s service. She is very knowledgeable and explains things clearly. She also gave some homework exercises which is always beneficial. Highly recommended!! Thanks.\nI thoroughly enjoyed it. My therapist was very nice. Her touch was the perfect pressure for me and exactly to my liking. Hard but a good hard. So tired of therapists that tickle me \u00be of the way into the massage because they tire out, Kristin was 100% all the way. After, she gave me some tips to live more ergonomically well and a great stretching example. Thoroughly enjoyed my visit. Looking forward to the next one.\nKristin puts you at ease.\nIf you are looking for a very good massage therapist, you don\u2019t need to look any further because you have just found him. If you have a problem, Shem uses in addition to massage various treatment methods to help you. He has excellent knowledge of the human body \u2013 the bones and muscles. Once you provide all facts about your injury, he determines what treatment might help you; just check the \u201ctreatment\u201d section to see all. With Shem you got a feeling, his therapy is not just a job for him but he appears really wanting to help. If you come just for a good massage, without any specific problem, you will get it and you will leave the office feeling great.\nShem provided an incredible treatment; he addressed my concerns and also intuitively fixed other problems. I left feeling better, and looking forward to another treatment. After trying a number of RMT`s in Vancouver, and always leaving disappointed, I am happy to have found Shem.\nI benefit greatly from massage therapy and Shem is among the best I\u2019ve ever seen. He can pinpoint problem areas with uncanny accuracy. I always leave his office feeling better.\nI am so relieved to have found a professional, knowledgeable, and talented massage therapist: Shem does incredible work! I finally have hope for relief from pain and good advice on how to care for my body.\nJaco R : Shem is a great therapist and listen to your body\u2019s needs and identify the problem spots throughout the massage and focus on these areas. I went for a general massage which was apparently a good change for Shem who normally get request to focus on problem areas. He is very professional and welcoming.\nShem is very knowledgeable. He worked on my shoulder&neck and was very painful at the time, but feels very good later. I love good painful massage. He also told me that my weak core is contributing to my back problem. I will do the exercise that he taught me and hope to work with him to get pain free healthy body!\nShem\u2019s massage helped me with my chronic insomnia and fatigue caused by my stressful work. It is not only an immediate stress relieve, it brings the system back to balance, increase energy and vitality. Incredible!\nShem began treating me for a shoulder injury\u2026.That\u2019s over 4 years ago. He is simply the best.\nI found Shem by accident after my back went out and I\u2019m so grateful that he was able to treat me. He was, quite simply, amazing and I\u2019ve recommended him to a number of people already. I can\u2019t say enough good things about him.\nThe most relaxing and painful (good pain) massage I\u2019ve ever had. Always look forward to it! thanks Shem!\nMy first massage with Shem was very good. The next day, I woke with less stiffness and pain. I\u2019ll definitely be back and have already recommended him to someone else. Everything about his business appeals to me: the online booking, quiet music, as well as his demeanor and knowledge.\nMy first appointment with Shem went very well \u2013 in fact, it exceeded my expectations. I chose this RMT randomly when searching for massage therapy located in downtown Vancouver; I feel lucky as I am sure I made the right choice. Shem appears to be very knowledgeable about human body and its functions and has excellent knowledge of his profession. More than that, he is using various additional techniques such as physiotherapy, so his treatment is a complex of treatments he considers to be most helpful for the individual problem. I would not hesitate to recommend him to anybody.\nThis was the first massage I have ever had where after walking out of the session, I instantly felt improvements in my problem areas. It was great and definitely worth it! I recommend Shem to anyone who is needing help with their joint/muscle problems. It was such an awesome session that I have recommended him to my husband! Thanks Shem \u2013 looking forward to next session!\nA really great first session with Shem. He brings such knowledge to the table, literally. I just moved from out East and was afraid I wouldn\u2019t find a therapist who knew my body well. Shem has already made me feel like we have been working together for some time. I look forward to the next sessions to come.\nShem is undoubtedly one of the best this city has to offer. His treatments are truly innovative and he uses his education to his clients\u2019 advantage. He is very in tune to what is required by me and tries various techniques until results are reached. Super!!\nShem really is unbelievable \u2013 perfect. Better than all the doctors I went to. The mixture of massage and physio is very unusual for a massage clinic. It works, I was able to cut down on my pain medication. He knows every nerve and bone in a human being and is able to explain what is wrong and how he is going to make things better. Thank you.\nAll the discomforts on my back were gone after the first visit. He is very genuine and professional. Shem, you are one truly amazing therapist!\nShem to the rescue !!!\nAs always, Shem sorts out my neck and back, or wherever the aches and pains are. He\u2019s by far the best Massage Therapist I\u2019ve been to. I\u2019ve recommended him to several friends and colleagues, and they are all very pleased with the treatments. He has a great personality too\u2026. Highly recommend his services.\nAlways grateful for Shem\u2019s help and advice. I would recommend him to anyone looking for a professional and awesome therapist.\nI always feel a lot better after every treatment. The long trip to Shem\u2019s clinic is always worth it. Very highly recommended to anyone looking for a massage therapist!\nThank you Shem, I haven\u2019t felt this relaxed in years! Your technique is the best and leaves one totally calmed. This is the best massage I have had in years, and I go weekly!\nI\u2019ve been to a few massage therapists, but none of them compare to the quality of treatment that I received from Shem. He used great techniques and seemed to genuinely care about my health and well being. I would definitely recommend him to others and plan on returning regularly.\nZoe M. says: As always, fantastic. Every time after the treatment I feel like a new person!!!!!The best therapist ever!\nBest therapist I have ever been to. Don\u2019t go anywhere else till you have at least tried Shem!\nI was in for a one hour session for some lower back pain and as always left feeling amazing. All the small pains, tightness and stress I went in with were gone and I felt as relaxed as if I had been on vacation. Shem is an amazing therapist and I would recommend him to anyone without a doubt. His skill and knowledge will take care of your physical side and his great personality will definitely put you at ease and even make you laugh as he eases the pains away. Can\u2019t recommend this man enough.\nThe treatment was most helpful, and I have been trying to use the techniques to improve muscle strength by myself, it works well.\nFantastic might be the best way to describe how I felt walking out. I have/had renewed movement and range. I will happily recommend you to anyone looking. Thanks again.\nJohanne N: Thanks so much Shem!!!\nBradley H: The massage was incredible as always. Have a great time at Manning Park and see you on the 2nd.\nMelinda B : I was very impressed and would certainly recommend you to others.\nBryan S: Hi There, I had a great relaxing massage yesterday with Shem. I will definitely be back and will be sending my husband to see him as well. Thanks.\nMassage Therapy \u2013 The only way to go.\nI look forward to the energetic work-over that I receive with each visit. The treatments have given new life to the tired and stiff muscles and eased or removed the pain from some chronic sore spots. It\u2019s well worth each session just to come away relaxed and comfortable."

Chassidus was comparable to a beam of light at the edge of a forest: all who approached it did so very cautiously, to verify that it was indeed a friendly, welcoming inn and not a bandits' den.\nR. Dov Ber had another reason to be wary of Chassidus. He viewed his ascetic practices as an important part of his Avodas HaShem. Tales of the wonders performed by the Baal Shem Tov, his emphasis on the joyous service of God, and his refection of abstention and asceticism could only increase the Maggid's suspicions of the new movement.\nBut the Maggid's asceticism continued to take its toll on his frail body. The pain in his legs was excruciating at times, and he and his family sought medical help throughout Europe. The doctors told him only an operation could help him, but he feared himself too feeble to undergo one. He tried various remedies, without success, and was relegated to walking on crutches. The pain did not bother him as much as the energy it sapped from his Torah studies.\nThere are several versions of what happened next. According to one, R. Mendel of Bar, a student of the Baal Shem Tov, came to Turchin and stayed with a local Jewish patron. the Maggid, who had been fasting daily for eight weeks, lived next door. Entering his host's home, R. Mendel heard the Maggid teaching. Impressed with what he heard, R. Mendel advised him to approach the Baal Shem Tov for a cure. \"Better to take refuge in HaShem than to trust in man\" (Tehillim 118:8), replied the Maggid.\nReturning to the Baal Shem, R. Mendel told him, \"I saw a beautiful 'vessel' in Turchin.\"\n\"I've seen him for years,\" replied the Baal Shem. \"I yearn for him to come to me.\" Indeed, the Baal Shem Tov labored to win over the outstanding people destined by Providence to disseminate his teachings.\nMeanwhile, the Maggid's family urged him to make the journey to Medzibozh. \"How much longer will you endanger your health?\" asked his wife, unable to see him in such pain. \"How much longer will you stubbornly refuse to humble yourself with even one visit to the Baal Shem Tov? He works wonders! Surely he can cure you.\"\nHe finally agreed to go.\nI'm told you have decided to come to me, to take refuge in the shadow of the fear of the Lord. May God's grace be upon you. You still doubt that you will accomplish your intended goal. I therefore implore you to ignore the vanities and lies of impulsive people, for they are baseless. It is not [as they say] with me. I wish only to help people, not to harm them. If, Heaven forbid, I don't find favor with you, the choice is yours. Heaven is my witness that your spirit will be doubly rewarded, the thirst of your soul will be quenched, and you will provide support for me as well. I have never written such a letter, but you have been chosen by HaShem to spread my teachings.... So abandon your stubbornness...and come to me. It will be good for us and for Klal Yisrael.\nTo tell the truth, I see an auspicious sign in the student who bears this letter. If R. Nachman of Horodenka is a holy Tzaddik, how much more so must his Rebbe be. Your talmid has breathed life into me, and I therefore wish you all the best.\nAlthough I know you have opposed our ways, I hope that when you come, God willing, you will \"taste the tree of life and live forever.\" there are very lofty matters to attend to, so come quickly and remain here.\nEn route to the Baal Shem, the Maggid's wagon kept breaking down. He wrote the Baal Shem Tov that he had been delayed. \"My heart tells me I've been mistaken until now,\" he added. He finally arrived in Medzibozh on Erev Shabbos.\nUpon meeting the Baal Shem Tov, R. Dov Ber began to relate everything that had happened on the way. the Baal Shem interrupted him and continued the story himself, noting each problem with the wagon and where it had occurred.\nThe Maggid then asked for a cure for his sickness. \"My horses don't eat matzos!\" the Baal Shem scolded.\nBewildered, the Maggid broke into a sweat and went outside to collect himself. Spotting R. Yaakov of Onipol, he requested that R. Yaakov ask the Baal Shem why he hadn't fulfilled the mitzvah of loving the stranger. While he sympathized with the Maggid, R. Yaakov couldn't speak so harshly to his Rebbe - at least not directly. Instead, he passed through the Baal Shem's house, and on his way out he shouted, \"A forlorn Jew sitting outside wants to know why the master doesn't love strangers.\" The Baal Shem immediately gathered ten men to placate R. Dov Ber.\nLater, as the Maggid lay bedridden, the Baal Shem recited Tehillim by his side for two weeks. \"At first I wanted to cure you through prayer,\" he told R. Dov Ber. \"But now I see that I must apply a medicinal remedy.\"\nIn another version of the encounter, the Baal Shem offered the Maggid a choice of two cures: sheimos (a Kabbalistic remedy involving the names of God), which would give him immediate strength and vigor, or a medicinal treatment, which would take much longer and be far less effective. \"I am unworthy of being healed by sheimos,\" the Maggid replied. His illness was cured medically, but he remained weak to the end of his life. The Baal Shem remarked that had the Maggid chosen the Kabbalistic treatment, he would have become healthy enough to \"chop a wagonful of wood.\" Years later, when R. Dov Ber's frailty made his learning more and more difficult, he openly regretted his choice.\nA second version of the encounter between the founder of Chassidus and the man who would succeed him begins with a key figure - the Pnei Yehoshua, rabbi of Lvov and one of R. Dov Ber's mentors.\nThe Pnei Yehoshua was once learning when someone rushed into the Beis Medrash and announced that a man outside had asked to see him immediately on business. The Pnei Yehoshua went out, greeted the stranger, and asked him what was so urgent. \"Your shochet has been selling treife meat for over ten years,\" the man replied breathlessly. \"Send for him and see for yourself.\" With that, he sped off in his carriage before the Pnei Yehoshua could ask who he was. Later, when the shochet (slaughterer) finally confessed, the Pnei Yehoshua realized that the stranger must have been the famous Baal Shem Tov.\nSome months later, the Baal Shem reappeared outside the Beis Medrash. This time the Pnei Yehoshua came out immediately and recognized him. \"When R. Dov Ber lodges here, tell him in my name that his legs will not be well unless he comes to me,\" declared the Baal Shem. Again, he sped away.\nWhen the Pnei Yehoshua moved to Frankfurt to serve as its rabbi, his son-in-law replaced him as rabbi of Lvov. Before his departure, the Pnei Yehoshua advised his son-in-law to consult R. Dov Ber whenever necessary and the Maggid developed a warm, stimulating relationship with the new rabbi of Lvov.\nObstinately ignoring his family's urgings to see the Baal Shem Tov, R. Dov Ber soon grew incurably lame. Desperate, his family asked the rabbi of Lvov to visit his sick friend. Perhaps he could convince him to go to the Baal Shem.\nWhen he suggested to R. Dov Ber that he travel to the Baal Shem, the Maggid expressed his reservations about the \"miracle-worker.\" \"Why not go see for yourself?\" the rabbi suggested. \"Surely you cannot judge without seeing the Baal Shem in person.\"\nThis approach appealed to the Maggid, and he set out for Medzibozh. On the road, however, he began to wonder whether a scholar was permitted to take so much time from his studies. He consoled himself by anticipating that the Baal Shem Tov would surely impart the kind of divrei Torah befitting a Tzaddik who had inspired thousands of Jews.\nR. Dov Ber arrived on Erev Shabbos and spent Shabbos with the Baal Shem. At the Friday night seudah (meal), the Maggid listened attentively, hoping to hear teachings affecting Heaven and Earth.\n\"Once I was traveling with Alexi, the wagoneer,\" recalled the Baal Shem. \"We came to the middle of the forest and there was no more hay for the horses. We didn't know what to do until, thank God, a non-Jew passed by with his horse and gave us some hay.\" With that the Baal Shem said Birkas HaMazon and the meal was over.\nThe Maggid was horrified. \"Instead of delving into the depths of man's soul,\" he thought, \"he speaks about horses!\" He considered absenting himself from the second Shabbos seudah, lest he waste even more time. But he didn't want to embarrass his host and hoped that this time things would be different.\nThe next day, the Baal Shem recollected how he and Alexi had once traveled through parched fields under a scorching sun, with no water to drink and no spring or well in sight. They wouldn't reach the nearest town until evening. Suddenly, like a Godsend, a non-Jew appeared carrying water buckets. When they asked what he was doing in such a remote place, he replied, \"I don't know myself. My feudal lord seems to have lost his senses. He sent me on a three-day journey through the forest and fields with these buckets, and today is the third day.\"\nThe Maggid understood that these stories were intended to demonstrate HaShem's providence. It was the Baal Shem's way of instilling emunah in people by means of parables and mundane stories. What he didn't know was that they contained deep wisdom as well.\nHe decided to skip Shalosh Seudos and return home immediately after Shabbos, without even seeking a cure or spiritual guidance.\nThere wasn't enough moonlight to begin the return journey home. At midnight R. Dov Ber was summoned to the Baal Shem. His host inquired if he knew how to learn Kabbalah. When the Maggid replied affirmatively, the Baal Shem asked him to explain a passage in Eitz Chaim (Tree of Life) by Rav Chaim Vital, a disciple of the Ari, z\"l.\nThe Maggid studied the passage for a few minutes and proceeded with his explanation. \"You don't know anything!\" declared the Baal Shem. The Maggid reread the passage. \"My interpretation is correct,\" he maintained. \"Tell me yours and we'll see who's right.\"\nThe Baal Shem grasped the book, and his face began to shine. He told R. Dov Ber to stand. Light filled the room, and the Baal Shem was encircled by fire. The Maggid saw angels appear as the Baal Shem recited their names, and suddenly he understood the lofty secrets hidden within the text.\nAt this point, the Maggid could no longer stand, and the Baal Shem showed him to a bed. The Maggid later related, \"I no longer saw him, but for two hours I heard sounds and beheld awesome fire and lightning. I became very frightened and fainted.\"\nThe Baal Shem later told the Maggid, \"Your interpretation was correct, but you were learning only the 'body' of the hidden Torah. Now you have penetrated its 'soul.'\"\nR. Dov Ber remained in Medzibozh for an extended period, and became a disciple of the Baal Shem Tov, learning great wisdom and deep secrets, and clinging to him with his heart and soul.\nWhen R. Dov Ber had returned from Medzibozh the rabbi of Lvov asked his friend how he had laid to rest all his doubts about the Baal Shem Tov. R. Dov Ber answered by recounting his mystical experience with the Eitz Chaim. \"I looked into the Baal Shem's face and thought, 'Could this be a creature like us, a mortal? Perhaps he has fallen from Heaven.' This resolved all my doubts, for one can question his fellow man, but not a Heavenly creature.\"\nThe meeting of the founder of Chassidus and his successor was both fateful and mysterious. Like most Torah scholars, R. Dov Ber fully expected a meeting of minds, an incisive debate, an exchange of ideas and chiddushim. What he heard, instead, were cryptic words and seemingly simple stories. This meeting was, for the next head of the Chassidic movement, an unforgettable lesson in the power of simplicity and the limitations of a scholarship which does not reach into the inner soul of the Torah.\nThe Talmud states: \"One cannot compare someone who reviews his learning one hundred times with one who does so one hundred one times\" (Chagigah 9b). Before he met the Baal Shem Tov, it was said of R. Dov Ber that there wasn't a single work, including the works of the Kabbalah, that he hadn't learned one hundred one times. Nevertheless, his learning with the Baal Shem far surpassed anything he had studied before. He was amazed by the Baal Shem's grasp of the \"soul\" of the subject. Indeed, it is said that once, when hearing the Baal Shem expound the work of the early Kabbalists, he touched the Baal Shem's hand to convince himself that such wisdom could come from a flesh-and-blood mortal.\nDespite his poor health, the Maggid learned with the Baal Shem in Medzibozh every night. In these lessons the Baal Shem passed on to him many secrets and much hidden knowledge: the language of birds and trees, Divine Names, and Unifications. Together, they pored over the Kabbalistic works Ma'ayan Chochmah and Raziel HaMalach.\nOnce, learning with the Baal Shem became so intense that the Maggid fainted and unconscious for several hours. The Baal Shem went to the mikveh three times that day to pray for his recovery.\nThe Baal Shem recognized the greatness of the Maggid from the beginning. He told one of his disciples, R. Chaim of Krasna: \"When the Maggid came to me, he was already a pure, golden menorah. All that was needed was to light the candles....\"\nOn another occasion, he declared, \"If the Maggid were healthy enough to immerse in the mikveh, Moshiach would come immediately, for this act would inspire mankind to repent.\"\nThe Maggid eventually wanted to return home, but the Baal Shem Tov pleaded with him to stay: \"Don't leave, I need you. For you are like one who draws from a wellspring and causes it to replenish itself. An unused well can dry up, but one whose waters are drawn gushes abundantly.\"\n\"People think of my grandfather, the Maggid, as a student of the Baal Shem Tov,\" related R. Yisrael of Rizhin. \"It was not so: they taught each another. But my grandfather was weak and sickly, while the Baal Shem was strong and healthy, and able to absorb more.\"\nThe Baal Shem once expressed this himself to R. Dov Ber: \"What is the difference between you and me? We can both bring benefits and blessings to the Jews. But I can effect this by merely thinking, whereas you must marshal your will.\"\nNot everything the Maggid learned in Medzibozh was taught through seforim. When the Maggid asked the Baal Shem Tov to explain why the Zohar states that the verse \"And these are the judgments...\" (Shmos 21:1), refers to the secret of reincarnation, he told his disciple to go to a forest and stand near a tree by a stream. the Maggid did so, and soon a well-dressed, wealthy-looking man came by, rested in the shade of the tree, and drank from the stream. He then left, but forgot his wallet. Another passerby found the forgotten wallet, pocketed it, and walked off. Then a wretched-looking pauper lay down beneath the tree to rest from his wearying journey. Before he could close his eyes, the first man came back in search of his lost wallet, accused the poor man of its theft, and beat him relentlessly.\nThe Maggid, perplexed, returned to Medzibozh, where his mentor explained what had taken place.\n\"In their first incarnation on this earth,\" said the Baal Shem Tov, \"one man took another to court, demanding a certain sum of money. Though the man's claim was well-founded, the judge negligently dismissed the case.\n\"In their return to this earth, the man who actually owed the money lost his wallet, which contained just the sum under dispute. The man who ought to have collected that sum in court found the wallet. The pauper had been, in his first incarnation, the judge, so he was roundly beaten because he'd caused the debtor to sin by keeping money not rightfully his. Thus, each got what he deserved! That, then,\" he concluded, \"is the meaning of the Zohar - 'the secret of reincarnation.'\"\n\"Why are you followers called chassidim?\" the Maggid once asked the Baal Shem Tov. \"Our Sages say Chassidus is greater than sanctity, humility, fear of sin, Divine inspiration, and even resurrection of the dead.\"\n\"We learn that one who burns his cut fingernails is called a 'Chassid,'\" replied the Baal Shem. \"Though it is very difficult to burn fingernails, the chassid does so to prevent others from being harmed. He sacrifices himself for others, going beyond the letter of the law, and completely nullifies himself. This, then, is Chassidus: going beyond the letter of the law in mitzvos between man and HaShem, and between man and his fellow man.\"\nR. Dov Ber considered the Baal Shem Tov a purely spiritual being. He related, \"I once beseeched Heaven to show me someone whose limbs and sinews were completely sanctified. I was shown the Baal Shem Tov, but with no semblance of a body, just a pure flame.\n\"One erev Yom Kippur, at the Baal Shem's table, I saw him as a flame of fire: His hands were fiery and so was his food. The Baal Shem later revealed to me that at that moment he had learned the insights gained by Moshe Rabbenu when he ascended Mount Sinai and remained there for forty days and nights without food.\" Indeed, the Maggid asserted, \"I am greater than all Baal Shem Tov's disciples. For only I have seem him elevate every item of food and drink he puts into his mouth.\"\nAnother erev Yom Kippur, the Baal Shem's tallis slipped out of his gartel. The Maggid approached and carefully tucked it back into place. Suddenly, he was overcome with fear of HaShem. He was so overwhelmed that he almost fell, and when he grabbed a table for support, he declared, \"Master of the Universe, I didn't know my Rebbe had such awe of You!\"\nR. Moshe of Kubrin related that many years after the Baal Shem's passing, the Maggid found a handkerchief among his personal effects. When he noticed some snuff left on it by the Baal Shem, he was seized with such fear that he fainted, and it took great effort to revive him.\nR. Moshe of Kubrin also told of two relatives of the Baal Shem who asked him to settle a dispute. Believing himself to be an interested party, he sent them to the Maggid. As R. Dov Ber sat down before them, he suddenly heard the Baal Shem's footsteps in an adjoining room. Fearful that this eavesdropping might jeopardize his impartiality, he rose and declared, \"By the power of the Torah and the court, whoever need not be here should leave.\" The Baal Shem obeyed the decree and left.\n\"Despite the Maggid's great fear of his Rebbe,\" concluded R. Moshe \"his fear of God was even greater!\"\nIn return for a favor, R. Shneur Zalman of Liadi once asked the Maggid to reveal the Baal Shem Tov's essence. After careful thought, he commented, \"Had he lived in the times of the Tannaim, he would have been a wonder; in the era of the Prophets, an innovation; and, in the period of the Patriarchs, noteworthy.\"\nHad R. Shneur Zalman not heard it from his Rebbe the Maggid, he wouldn't have believed the Baal Shem Tov mortal.\nBesides studying under the Baal Shem Tov in Medzibozh, the Maggid was being groomed to succeed him. Some say the Baal Shem saw this as soon as the Maggid arrived, never proclaiming it but alluding to it at times. Certainly, the Maggid was particularly singled out for honor by his new-found Rebbe.\nDov Ber ben Chavah: For a salvation of body and soul, a complete recovery for his sick legs, the purification of his soul, spirit, and body by the light of the holy Torah, and true emunas chachomim [faith in the Sages] for him and his household, among all Israel. Pidyon nefesh [the redemption of a soul]: two rubles.\nYisrael ben Sarah: For health and a good, long life. He should merit to form a bond with all souls, connecting them to their roots; and all his enemies should repent and become his friends. May HaShem will it, and may you be inscribed and sealed for good. Pidyon nefesh: one ruble per week.\nIt was an extraordinary gesture: receiving a kvittel from the founder of Chassidus himself! No doubt, the Maggid of Mezritch was the only person ever so honored.\nWhen the Maggid left his Rebbe to head home, the Baal Shem placed his hands on his protege's head and blessed him. Then the Baal Shem lowered his own head and asked for the Maggid's blessing. The Maggid tried to pull away, but the Baal Shem grasped his hands and placed them on his head. The Maggid had no choice but to bless him as well."

                            "text": "The wealthy man went home. Then, harnessing his best carriage and horses and taking his coachman, he returned to the Baal Shem Tov with his wife. The Baal Shem Tov told them, \u201cIf you want children, you will have to agree to become poor, so poor that you will literally have nothing more than a loaf of bread. You will have to ask people for charity and even go begging from door to door.\u201d Once the wealthy man\u2019s wife agreed, the man himself agreed.\nOn the way home, they stopped in a shtetl near their town, and stayed in an expensive hotel. There the wealthy man learned that his ships had sunk. He also heard from the hotel guests that all his possessions had burned to the ground.\nHe could no longer travel home, because he was a debtor. So he dismissed his coachman, and sold his horse and carriage to make some money. He moved into a small shtetl, rented a poor apartment and stayed there until his wife told him the good news: she was pregnant. He gave whatever small amount of money that remained to his wife, and he went out into the world, traveling with the riffraff, begging from door to door. Meanwhile, his wife gave birth to a boy. Jews, who are \u201cmerciful and children of the merciful,\u201d supported them from their charity boxes.\nThe once-wealthy man traveled with the riffraff deep into Germany. He was happy with his lot, for he was sure that at home his wife was already bringing up their child.\nHowever, one wintry Saturday night, as he was warming himself at the oven-fireplace in a beis medrash, he gave a deep sigh. The shamash asked him why he was sighing. He answered that he wanted a fresh glass of tea from a samovar. He recalled how, when he had once been wealthy, many Jews had drunk tea at his own house\u2014and he compared that to his situation now. The shamash was moved. He immediately brought him to the richest man in town. He took him into the kitchen and asked the servant woman to give him a glass of tea from the samovar.\nThere was a half-open door between the kitchen and the salon. And from the salon the once-wealthy man heard weeping. He asked the servant woman what the weeping was about. She told him that the master of the house is very rich and even has his own ships at sea. However, he has great troubles. In recent years he lost his wife and two adult children, from whom no more was left than a son from one and a daughter from the other. He arranged for the marriage of these two to each other, and he gave them control of his business affairs. Unfortunately, they do not have any children. The entire week, they are involved in the business. But every Saturday night, they come to their grandfather, give him the business figures, and afterwards, she hears weeping.\nThe guest told the servant woman to tell the master of the house that he can help. She did so, and the master of the house immediately called him in. He told the guest that a tragedy had overtaken his granddaughter: she was unable to become ritually pure [and thus have relations with her husband]. As soon as she would come out of the mikveh, she would again become ritually impure. And so his grandson and granddaughter come to him every Saturday night, crying and asking him to allow them to get divorced. Although he had brought in many doctors, there was no improvement.\nThe guest assured the master of the house that the Baal Shem Tov from Poland could certainly help him. The Baal Shem Tov might want to come in person, and that would involve great expenses. (At that time, the Baal Shem Tov used to travel on his own to the needy in order to sanctify the name of heaven and to show the Jews that God has compassion on them and listens to the prayers of their tzaddikim). The master of the house immediately hired a coachman to travel with the guest directly to the Baal Shem Tov in Mezhibozh. He also sent a letter along with the guest, and promised that if the Baal Shem Tov were willing to come himself, he would pay whatever the Baal Shem Tov requested.\nIn those days, the trip from Germany to Mezhibozh, by horse and carriage, took several weeks. When they arrived in Mezhibozh, the Baal Shem Tov told the coachman to go home, while he kept the guest [the formerly wealthy man] with him over Shabbos. Immediately after Havdalah on Saturday night, the Baal Shem Tov had his gentile servant, Alexia, harness his horse and wagon and bring along the guest. When they left town, he told Alexia to tie the reins to the wagon, turn his back to the horses, and let them go on their own. The guest saw towns and villages flit by just as if the horses and wagon were flying through the air.\nThe horses came to a halt in a small forest near an inn. They heard the cry of an infant coming from the top of a tree. The Baal Shem Tov told Alexia to wait there, and he and the guest walked over to the inn.\nThere they found over ten Jews reciting Psalms, and the innkeeper and his family in great distress. Obeying the request of the Baal Shem Tov, the guest asked the people, \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d He was told that the wife of the innkeeper had a number of times given birth to boys. Each time, on the vach nacht (the night of watching, before the circumcision), it seemed as if some changeling had been exchanged for her son\u2014then this apparent changeling suffered for a few hours, and died. And so this time the innkeeper had brought a quorum of Jews from the town to remain awake with the mother the entire night, learning Torah and reciting Psalms in order to guard the new-born child. However, a few minutes ago the mother had noticed that another child had apparently been exchanged for her own.\nA few minutes later, the guest came back to the inn carrying a child in his arms. The Baal Shem Tov told him to give the child to the mother. She recognized it as her own, and there was great joy in the inn.\nThe Baal Shem Tov and the guest again sat in Alexia\u2019s wagon, and the horses again flew as before, until they came to a stop deep in Germany at the house of the rich grandfather. Coming into the house, they met the two grandchildren weeping in the presence of their grandfather, as they did every Saturday night. The grandfather and grandchildren were filled with great joy when they saw the guest with the Baal Shem Tov, whom they did not recognize. The grandfather asked after the coachman whom he had sent to get the Baal Shem Tov. The guest replied, \u201cThe coachman is traveling in the natural way, so he will first come in the normal period of time. But we came here miraculously. We only left Mezhibozh at the beginning of the evening, and our trip was interrupted with a miraculous event\u201d (the story with the saved child).\nThe Baal Shem Tov sent someone to call the town shamash (who, as shamash of the Chevra Kadisha and the Chevra Nosim, was involved with burying the dead, and so was not a fearful man). He commanded him to light his lantern and enter the bath. He should carry the Baal Shem Tov\u2019s stick into the mikveh room he should carry the Baal Shem Tov\u2019s stick, and say loudly: \u201cThe Baal Shem Tov is here in town, and he decrees that you leave this mikveh.\u201d The shamash obeyed. As soon as he said these words, there was a great commotion in the mikveh room, and a voice answered him, \u201cIs it not that Rabbi Israel Baal Shem Tov has chased us out of Poland? Now, does he also want to chase us out of Germany?\u201d And there was a great wind that blew out the lantern. The shamash grew frightened and barely escaped with his life, and back to the Baal Shem Tov.\nThen the Baal Shem Tov himself went, taking along the shamash and the guest. He stood with the lantern in the mikveh room and told the shamash and the guest to go down to the mikveh. The shamash should strike the water with the Baal Shem Tov\u2019s stick, using all his force. When the shamash did so, they could hear a deep groan from the mikveh, as though someone had been killed. The Baal Shem Tov lit the mikveh with the lantern, and they saw that the water turned had red, the color of blood. Then the Baal Shem Tov sent for the rabbi of the town. He told him to drain the mikveh and kasher it with milk [?], in accordance with the law. He added that from now on, the granddaughter would be able to purify herself according to the law of Moshe and Israel and that she would have children.\nThe grandfather immediately the grandfather ordered his grandchildren to bring the accounts from the books, and on the spot he paid the guest with ready cash.\nThe Baal Shem Tov, the guest, the rabbi, the shamash, the grandfather and the grandchildren ate a joyful melave malka together. The Baal Shem Tov took his leave and arrived came at the inn in time for the circumcision.\nThe innkeeper, the grandfather and his grandchildren, and the guest were all helped through the prayers of the Baal Shem Tov. May his merit protect us and all Israel."

But here goes: Shem and Mara are trapped in that creepy guy's (Silas? We'll go with Silas) fancy house. Mara is very uncomfortable with the way she is dressed and made up by the female servants in the house. For the first time, her hair isn't wild and tangled, and she has make up on her face, and both Silas and Shem take notice. Shem, though, is a gentleman, and thus is discreet in his admiration and is in Protection Mode to keep Mara safe. Silas, on the other hand, is still lecherous, and grows more so as he drinks. Everyone settles into dinner, and Mara is hurt by Shem's attempt to be dismissive and rude to her in a ploy to throw Silas off their plan.\nAs the dinner wears on, it becomes clear to Shem that Silas plans to get Mara drunk, take advantage of her, and then dispose of her. In order to do so, he most likely plans to dispose of Shem as well. Mara and Shem end up improvising a scheme of Mara getting sick to get them out of dinner and away from Silas. Back in her room, Shem wants to escape, but Mara is too exhausted to travel. He decides they can sleep for a short spell before making their move, but when Mara is startled awake, she peeks outside to see Silas leading two Roman soldiers into the house. Not surprisingly, he has sold Shem out.\nShem and Mara make a hasty getaway out the window. They have a perilous journey over to the sea of Galilee, where they meet up with Zebedee, a friend of Shem's dad. He helps them out and finally gets them to Jesus. There, Mara has a Moment, and then runs away.\nShe now feels unworthy to talk to Jesus. Jesus seeks out Shem, and their conversation makes Shem all the more skeptical. Apparently, Jesus tells him that Shem will be the first of many, and that his name is now Stephen.\nAm I the only one with a terrible sense of foreboding here?!\nJesus also gives Shem a message to relay to his mother, Mary. *sniffle* Zebedee aids them back to Nazareth so that they can see Mary, and I just LOVED this part. I loved that we got to visit with her. *heart* Mara asks Shem why the soldiers are after him, and he finally tells her. Interiorly, Shem comes to the conclusion that if he survives, he wants to live in Sychar permanently, working in his grandfather's olive grove, and marry Mara. At this point, they have no idea if Nava is still alive or not, and Shem knows that he loves Mara, and wants to provide for her and Asher.\nAfter visiting with Mary, Mara has a change of heart. She wants to try and find Jesus again, who is now traveling towards Jerusalem. She has a feeling deep within her heart that Shem should accept Jesus's invitation to follow him. Although Shem doesn't agree, he does want Mara to have another chance to ask Jesus to heal Nava. They head on their way.\nOh boy. I just...these chapters really grabbed me. Does this mean that Shem is St. Stephen?! And does this mean that maybe Mara will end up with somebody else? Enosh, like Melanie mentioned? God forbid, the guy who seems to kill all of his young wives?!\nWow, these were some action-packed chapters. All along I've been assuming Mara and Shem would wind up together, but after the Stephen bombshell I'm not so sure anymore. If it is Enosh, he seems like a good person who would put Mara and her family first, unlike so many others in Sychar. Loved the Mary scene! I think it's fitting that Mara's visit with her inspired this change of heart and once again got her moving towards Jesus. I'm definitely excited to keep reading, but a bit sad too that we are so close to the end.\nKevin, right?! That was a shocker, on so many levels. Did not see that coming. And I agree about the book coming to an end - I'm sad! But more great book clubs to come, so stay tuned!\nThese chapters kept me on my toes with all the action but the biggest part was finding out that Shem is apparently St. Stephen. This is not where I was expecting the story to go and I'm now hoping for Mara to marry Enosh. I must point out though that I wasn't the first to suggest the two them. That was Deltaflute during part 3. I like that the author weaves other biblical characters into the story. It creates a fuller picture when I am reminded of other gospel stories. This week we got Zebedee, the father of James and John, the 10 lepers, and Mary. Looking forward to seeing how this book ends and yet with all good books would like it to last a little longer. If Shem goes to Jerusalem and is supposed to meet up with Joseph of Arimathea will he have a cameo in The Thief?\nIt was so interesting how she weaved all those Biblical characters into one. It makes me wonder if Longinus, the Roman solider, will also fit into her future stories. Really enjoy seeing the sense of confusion Shem feels over what Jesus said to him. I completely understand that. Sometimes Jesus asks us to do something and we are like NOOOOOOOO!!!! Our faith is so small sometimes.\nI completely agree. I really relate to Shem's struggles in this situation! And Longinus, I would guess so. I thought the same thing!"

You must be joking, I only paid 6,000 to get there yesterday.\nTaxi: But I have a good car with air conditioning.\nShem: The other taxi had air conditioning.\nTaxi: But my taxi has a CD stereo, did they have a CD stereo?\nShem: Yes, they had a CD stereo. Stop the car!\nTaxi: Oh, it\u2019s not safe to stop here, lots of traffic on the road.\nShem: Yes, but all the traffic is going in the opposite direction. Pull into that driveway!\nTaxi: But we haven\u2019t arrived at the office yet.\nShem: Yes, I know, stop the car!.\nShem: No! I\u2019ll give you 6,000 \u2013 take it or leave it.\nTaxi: Come on, it\u2019s nice to be nice, meet me half way; 17,500.\nShem: Half way to what? I said 6,000, no discussion!\nTaxi: Rafiki (friend in Swahili), the petrol prices are very high now in Tanzania.\nShem: Really, how much is petrol now?\nShem: I doubt a litre of petrol has tripled in price overnight. Pull over, I\u2019ll get that other taxi standing under the tree.\nTaxi: Oh but that a bad taxi, not safe for foreigners. If you leave your phone in that taxi you will never get it back. I\u2019m a good honest taxi.\nShem: That\u2019s funny, he said the same thing about your taxi last Friday.\nTaxi: Hahahaha, oh Kaka (brother in Swahili).

Headaches were common. A miserable attitude ran rampant from my own heart. Gardens drooped. Flowers sizzled. Animals panted from thirst.\nAnd then it happened \u2014 I awoke this morning to cool, refreshing air. A gentle breeze carried the chilly air in and out of the open windows. The stickiness was gone. The heavy weight of this unusual heat wave had moved on. I felt bliss. Reprieve.\nGod had given me a visual for a very important spiritual principle: the contrast between oppression and His refreshing. For three weeks my spirit had been tormented by the reckless decisions of a loved one. The future hung in the balance. I could barely breathe. Every day was marked with the inability to function except for those essential things that life brings. Oppression pressed against my body, mind, and spirit.\nRoget\u2019s Thesaurus describes oppressive in this way: bleak, brutal, burdensome, depressing, discouraging, disheartening, dismal, grinding, harsh, somber, unjust \u2026 and this is only a few of the descriptive words used.\nRefreshing, on the other hand, is referred to as: breathe new life into, cheer, enliven, exhilarate, quicken, recreate, regain, reinvigorate, rejuvenate, renovate, repair, replenish, restore, resuscitate, revive.\nCan you see the picture too?\nIn my oppressive state \u2014 resulting from the enemy\u2019s torment \u2014 my future looked bleak, depressing. I felt bathed in discouragement, broken with disheartening circumstances. My mood was somber. My words sometimes harsh. The oppression thickened the air around me and I could scarcely breathe some days. Like the deer panting for the water, my soul panted for the Lord\u2019s deliverance.\nLike the deer panting for the water, my soul panted for the Lord\u2019s deliverance.\nBut it didn\u2019t come right away.\nI had to endure the relentless tentacles of discouragement, at least for a time. I believe God waited so that I might experience the physical sensation of a spirit set free, refreshed by Him alone. My heart, heavy-laden with burdens and multiple sorrows, began to awaken \u2014 the crushing pain releasing the oil of the Holy Spirit. Like the cool, dry air flowing in from the Northwest that brought relief from the oppressive heat, the Spirit of God arrived on the wings of the wind to embrace and refresh and restore me.\nIn place of confusion, He brought His perfect peace.\nIn place of great sorrow, He tickled me with laughter.\nIn place of relentless, stifling oppression, He set me free to worship Him once more.\nDo you need a refreshing touch of the Lord? Have you felt the oppressive torment of the enemy of our soul? He is relentless, isn\u2019t he? But our God is faithful. His love never fails. Hold fast to His grace-filled hand and He will establish your footsteps in His Word.\nHe will set you free to worship, hope, and laugh again.\nNextWhere is God When My Strength is Gone?\nFaith Notes~ Tosin Olabode: Why God? Why Must Daddy Die?"

She\u2019s the county Coroner, and while the dead reveal their secrets on the exam table, she hides from the living. But hiding isn\u2019t working anymore. Sally is trapped in a bland, colorless existence. She can't breathe! She's suffocating and wants more, whatever that might be. When the dark and mysterious Derek Lemark enters her world, he opens doors to new possibilities, reveals dark desires, and challenges her to take a second chance on life. He dares her to breathe again, and promises...more. But what he offers comes at a price. Sally must choose: take the next step, or speak the one word which will end everything before it even begins.\nYOU WANT A SNEAK PEEK AT \" LEARNING TO BREATHE\"??\nThe light streaming in from the hallway dimmed and a man\u2019s chuckle drifted to her ears. It did strange things to her insides. Yummy things.\nHeat filled her cheeks. She was hoping for a good but stunning would do. Then she smiled, shifting her eyes down and to the left. She couldn\u2019t look at him and speak at the same time.\n\u201cYou look pretty amazing too.\u201d But she did peek, lifting her gaze up to take him in.\nDecked out in a tuxedo, the immaculate suit barely contained his muscular frame. Crisp and pressed, the bow tie wrapped snuggly around his neck. He carried himself with ease, as if he\u2019d been born in the elegant attire. Incredibly brilliant blue eyes flashed with mischief.\nAnd she was. She couldn\u2019t help herself. He was a magnet, an irresistible force she couldn\u2019t resist, but his words had her lowering her eyes again, as if she didn\u2019t dare stare upon his brilliance.\n\u201cDon\u2019t make fun of me,\u201d she said.\nDerek placed his hands on her bare shoulders, steadying her in the too high heels. Two glasses of wine shouldn\u2019t have her weaving on her feet. Or was that him making her weak in the knees?\nTracing the hardened muscle under his tuxedo became her sole purpose in life. As wonderfully intoxicating as the kiss was, it frightened her because of how uninhibited her response was. It didn\u2019t make sense. While the rational side of her brain said slow down, her hand fluttered, and her fingers gripped the buttons of his shirt, pulling him closer rather than pushing him away.\nWine had nothing to do with her knees giving way.

I asked if maybe something had been lost in translation, he said no and continued to explain. \u201cParis is like a dog, if you show it fear, it will bite. If the city and its people can sense you are afraid, you will see danger on every corner\u201d. I have taken this piece of advice whole heartedly.\nI have always felt very safe in Paris but with recent events around the world, this sense of fear was beginning to creep in. As soon as John explained, that concept resonated with me. I have fully embraced this attitude and carried it with me everywhere I go. I walk around Paris confidently and without fear and this feeling has not yet faltered.\nEach day I see police, armed guards, military forces walking around the streets, on the metros, in the parks. I even saw two police women on horses today! I always smile and give them a little nod, knowing that their very presence adds to my confidence. The city of Paris is full of light and energy, I know that the spirit of the city will continue to burn bright even in the current political environment that finds itself.\nsounds like Michelle is taking Paris by storm."

I felt creative there, I felt inspired. \u201cThis is where it is going to happen\u201d, I thought, envisioning my garment sketches coming to life in the streets of Chicago.\nHaving a baby was never part of the plan, especially at eighteen.\nI always knew I wanted to be a mother one day, but I had so many dreams I wanted to accomplish first.\nI can almost guarantee you there isn\u2019t a young mother/single mother who doesn\u2019t feel they let go of a piece, if not their entire dream to accommodate their little blessing. And that\u2019s fine, children do require sacrifice (and they are worth every single one).\nI visited Chicago for the first time in years a couple of weekends ago. And it felt like no time passed. As I approached the river walk I could envision the day I sat on those steps above the river with my Caribou Coffee in hand, headphones blaring J.Cole\u2019s Friday Night Lights, just going to town on a blank sketchbook. That beautiful city held onto my memories for me, just like I asked it to.\nAs I grew older my interests changed and my dream of being a designer diminished on its own. Being back in that city did not inspire me to design again, but it inspired me to do what I love, no matter what that may be. That \u201cendless possibilities\u201d feeling came rushing back to my soul like it had been waiting for us to reunite for all this time. I was given a glimpse back into the heart of that seventeen year old girl from Rockford, who had finally found her \u201cspecial place\u201d.\nMotherhood changed my life, but it did not end it. I think we, as mothers, need to remind ourselves of this more often.\nOur children want us to pursue our dreams, not settle for mediocrity. That feeling of euphoria that overcomes me when I am creating is the same feeling I want my son to feel one day when he takes that leap of faith towards his dream. And that got me thinking even deeper, how can I tell him to follow his heart if I did not follow my own?\nChange isn\u2019t giving up; doing nothing is giving up.\nSo let\u2019s take a moment to reacquaint ourselves with that rugged, undefined soul we once had. Let us never forget where our hearts stood when we had that constant lust for life."

Even though we moved away when I was young, it has always felt like my home.\nIt has always felt strange to be from a city that I rarely get to visit. I've lived in my current town for so long, but it just doesn't have the same feeling. It doesn't feel like my \"real home\".\nMaybe it's because every single one of my ancestors is from this city. I'm even a direct descendant of some of the families that founded Detroit. I've just always felt like I belonged in Detroit.\nI was overjoyed to finally return this Thanksgiving, to visit family members, and to explore the place I came from.\nThe few times I have been back never included a venture downtown, but I had always wanted to go. I love cities, but I didn't even know what the city I was born in really looked like and it drove me crazy.\nI wasn't sure what to expect, but as we made our way to the center of the city I was born in, I loved it instantly.\nIt wasn't the run down, decrepit, broken, abandoned city that I had always heard it was.\nThe ornate skyscrapers towered over busy streets. The sun was setting and people were just getting off of work and rushing home. The city seemed full of life and overflowing with energy.\nThere were all kind of restaurants, and shops that filled the bottom floors of the buildings, there was a tram car that ran down a busy street, an above ground subway train, there was even city stream rising up out of the streets!\nAt some moments, I felt like I was back in New York City!\nDowntown Detroit exceeded anything I had expected. It is a city with so much character, so much history with everything it has been through over the years and so much to see.\nThere are definitely still poverty stricken parts of this city, but that doesn't mean it is a place to be avoided. It's a place that needs attention, and that will hopefully one day have the same opportunities as it once did.\nI'm afraid I'm going to be thinking about this city, ever more than I was before.."

There was a Main Street that had at least one or two churches, a grocery store, 5 and 10 cent store, usually one bank, a movie theater, a farm and seed store, a hardware store, a doctor and dentist office, and if you were fortunate, a very small department store.\nSaturday evenings were the highlight of the week. Main Street was the gathering place for everyone in the community. The families would go to Main Street to park their cars along the street. It was a weekly social time for families to chat and to catch up on the most recent news.\nToday the small town Main Street is often closed businesses with boarded up windows. The movie theater showed its last movie long ago. The bank, if still in operation, has changed names and remodeled the old building so many times that it is difficult to recognize the former bank building. The schools have consolidated and changed their names. Neighborhoods have changed and some people do not know their neighbors. The family unit has dissolved to where often the whole family does not break bread together.\nBecause of a longing to return to the small town community atmosphere, more and more retired people are purchasing homes in 55+ retirement developments. They often provide a club house for the residents to attend social activities and become a member of the community.\nPeople are beginning to meet more often in homes. For example, a small group of believers meet regularly to attend Bible studies in their homes. The Amish do not build church buildings, instead they meet in each other's homes to promote community and preserve the roots of their traditional religion.\nThe followers of Jesus formed a community of believers and they met and worshiped together in each other's homes. For example, Martha welcomed Jesus into her home. Because of her hospitality, Jesus was given a place to rest His head, to eat supper, and to teach. She meant so much to Him because she welcomed Him into her home.\nPaul said in Acts 20:32 (The Message), \u201cNow I'm turning you over to God, our marvelous God whose gracious Word can make you into what He wants you to be and give you everything you could possible need in this community of holy friends.\nThis is where everybody knows your name!\nLord, God, thank You for knowing our names. Amen."

                            "text": "I grew up in a small Iowa farm town. I\u2019ve met people who say they\u2019re from a small town, and then I find out they had more than five stoplights \u2013 that is not a small town. My graduating class had 82 people in it, most of whom I had been in school with since kindergarten. My house was on the edge of town. The literal edge of town: my house, street, my neighbor\u2019s house, corn field. Growing up in this small town felt like torture. Everyone knew everything about me and my family, and it felt like there were always a million eyes on me. Because there were. I felt stifled, trapped. All I wanted was to get out. I felt like I was on a small, corn-covered island. Enter: karma.\nOn St. Thomas, there are real power families. And they\u2019re BIG families. I know people who work with my husband and later find out that their wife/sister/uncle/brother-in-law is the guy I always buy my coffee from. Small town Iowa is no different. It\u2019s frighteningly easy to run into someone and only later realize YOU may be related to them as well.\nMovie night is a big deal.\nMy hometown had a tiny movie theater with only one screen. You either saw the movie that was playing, or you didn\u2019t go to the movie. I feel spoiled in St. Thomas with seven \u2013 count \u2019em, seven \u2013 screens! You may think that with all the beach hopping opportunities, happy hours, and island-y things to do it sounds silly to want to see a movie. And we didn\u2019t, for the first six months we lived here. After we had settled in, however, we were more than happy to enjoy air-conditioning for a couple of hours and have a little taste of stateside normalcy.\nLimited shopping opportunities aka shopping as an adventure.\nWhen you live in an Iowa farm town, you may not have the luxury of a Target within 15 minutes of home. We only had a small Kmart. The closest Walmart was 30 minutes away. I remember getting in the car to drive 45 minutes to get to the closest mall. Irony at its finest, St. Thomas doesn\u2019t have Target or Walmart either, yet it has TWO Kmarts. And the nearest mall is a 20-minute plane ride away in Puerto Rico. You learn to deal with what you have.\nAny exciting day involves a journey.\nAs mentioned, shopping for anything significant involved at least a 30-minute drive to somewhere other than your small town back home. Island life isn\u2019t much different, in that any sort of adventure involves a journey. It was a good weekend in Iowa if you got to go to Target. It\u2019s a good day on St. Thomas if you get to drive across a 13-mile island to explore a new beach. Thirteen miles doesn\u2019t seem that far (you could make it halfway to Walmart in that time!), but you\u2019re dealing with mountains. Along the journey you see all kinds of things that you never thought you\u2019d see. Like a truck hauling office chairs. Never a dull moment.\nIt\u2019s always an exciting time when there is a county fair or other town-wide event taking place in a small town. You may get lucky and get out of school early to attend the festivities. It\u2019s also common to be let out of school for heavy snow or extreme cold; everyone needs to get home safely! Things shut down during big stuff. People are all staying in, or all going out, depending on the event. The Caribbean is no different! St. Thomas is a blur of activity during Carnival time for a solid two weeks. My husband gets two paid days off from work to attend. You can\u2019t travel on waterfront with an ounce of ease, and many businesses close so their staffs can party it up with the rest of the island.\nThey once closed school here on St. Thomas for rain, and I nearly choked on my coconut water. I called my dad (a former teacher), and we had a good laugh about it. If they shut down for rain, an inch of Iowa snow would certainly put people over the edge.\nSome people give directions based on street names or intersections, while others give directions using landmarks. I\u2019ve always been better at receiving directions with street names. When you learn to drive in a town that has really one major street (Broadway St. \u2013 very aspirational), it\u2019s not hard to figure out where everything is. My navigational skills have been tested here, as I swear there is one street sign on the entire island (aside from the waterfront tourist-centered stuff). All directions here include \u201cthe\u201d. Turn left at the Bridge to Nowhere. Go past the white wall. Did you see the big flamboyant tree? Ok, you\u2019ve gone too far.\nNeedless to say, I\u2019ve gotten lost A LOT. It doesn\u2019t help when you get stuck behind some slow-moving vehicle. I was used to being imprisoned on the road by a tractor or combine. It\u2019s a whole new experience to see an army of Safari taxis full of tourists clogging the one-lane road, or slowing down as to not hit the donkey. Ironically, instead of following a combine at a glacial pace, I now get stuck behind water trucks.\nYou know those pictures of old men at the local diner drinking coffee at the crack of dawn? When you don\u2019t really have many diner options in a small town, the old men drink their coffee at McDonald\u2019s. In my St. Thomas neighborhood, the patriarchs of the community gather in the early morning for a quick beer at the convenience store. They sit like gargoyles on the bench outside the store and monitor the comings and goings of the people in their island cars. If you\u2019re a friendly midwesterner, you wave. They don\u2019t wave back. Nearly a year of waving later, I\u2019m finally getting a head nod.\nIsland life is a very matriarchal society. The elderly women here have no problem with reprimanding local children (from their own family, or any other for that matter) when they forget to greet everyone with \u201cgood morning\u201d or \u201cgood afternoon\u201d. They also have no problem peering in your grocery cart and deciding that their own small bag of greens and half pumpkin deserves to slip in front of you in line. Small town elders will do this too, but they\u2019re sneaky about it. They\u2019ll chat with you about your family, the current weather, and then remind you how you were in diapers when they first watched you eat corn on the cob like you\u2019re buying there. How can you not guiltily allow them to go first?\nLife is about making the best of what you have.\nI hated growing up in that small town, but now it\u2019s comforting to have some of the same things surrounding me here on this small island. I\u2019m proud to be an Iowan, because living there made me appreciate the small things in life. Like taking care of the things you have, because new things aren\u2019t as readily available. Enjoying small moments, because they are what happen while you\u2019re waiting for big moments. Kindness and respect will take you a long way, and the people that don\u2019t return that favor aren\u2019t your problem. After moving 2,400 miles from everything and everyone I know, life\u2019s universal truths blatantly show themselves each and every day.\nSara is an avid reader, passionate yogi, and accidental island girl from the midwest. After cruising the Caribbean with her husband, they laughed about how much fun it would be to live on an island. With a mantra of no house, no kids, no regrets, they found themselves five months later in the St. Thomas airport with six suitcases, one set of golf clubs, and a 16 lb dog. Aside from learning to drive an island jeep named Rhonda and passionately seeking bugs in the house to destroy, Sara spends her days working with public relations and social media clients all over the world. Island life is teaching her a lot about just how many fantastic rum drinks exist, and a lot more about what really matters in life.

I was driving across the long bridge over the Ross Barnett Resevoir in Jackson, Mississippi and had the local Christian station playing. All the sudden, sandwiched between the well-known tunes of the day, the station announced a new song, \"Undo\" by a band called \"Rush of Fools,\" and I caught my breath as I realized that even though it was new to the radio, I knew the song by heart as I'd had the opportunity to play on it just a few months before. As the second verse blared through the speakers, I had to pull over onto the shoulder of the road and savor the eight notes of my violin that didn't land on the cutting room floor.\nI felt a similar feeling last night when a dear friend's mom posted on Facebook that my album was in the \"Half and Half\" section of the Catfish Alley Magazine Spring 2014 issue. It's just so exciting to have something you have worked on and dreamed about and put heart and soul into come to fruition, and to see a little article for my album in print, well, I kind of felt like a kid at Christmas. (My apologies for any social-media overload you might have endured...I was just so delighted and had to share!) But not only was it exciting to see something about my album in print, it was extra-special to see it in a publication from the small Mississippi town where I spent most of my adolescence. A town where I played carols at the only shopping mall with the youth orchestra every Christmas, competed in music competitions on the weekends and gave my highschool senior recital at the local college auditorium. A town where everybody knows your name, helps raise each other's children, and is proud of where they come from. And I'm thankful that in this small way, my town and I get to be proud of each other. And also, in this age where most news is about crime and wars, deficits and struggles, it's encouraging to see media that celebrates Southern food, folk, music, landscapes and other worthwhile fare.\n\"Bethany Daniel Bordeaux packed her violin in 2006, moved from Columbus to Nashville, Tenn, and was soon performing with multiple artists and the Nashville Philharmonic Orchestra.

                            "text": "Some big dreams feel too big to fit into your small town. College is a chance to escape and let those dreams grow.\nI come from a very small town in Virginia. Each time someone asks me where I\u2019m from in Virginia, I explain it to them in relation to the biggest towns around me, which are about an hour away.\nGrowing up, corn fields and cows dominated my life. Don\u2019t get me wrong, cows are so, so cute. But when that\u2019s the only scenery you come into contact with, life gets so boring. I knew I wanted a college that would be so different from my small town.\nI chose Penn State. With 46,000 students at the University Park campus, I knew I would meet so different people to find so many opportunities. Move-in day felt so exciting. The next four years would look so different from my whole life.\nI needed to get through the adjustment period first, though.\nI graduated with a class of about 300 people. The size of the first-year class at Penn State alone amazed me. Universities get their freshman settled in on campus before the rest of the students arrive. It\u2019s great, because it gives you time to feel lost without looking completely stupid.\nThen everyone else arrived on campus.\nThe first few weeks at a big college are really hard for townies. You meet so many new people every day and sit through ice breaker after ice breaker. I always believed I was really good with names until all of these get-to-know-you games were thrown in my face.\nThere were too many people to keep up with. Within those short two weeks, I felt like I\u2019d met more people than I ever met in high school.\nI realized that I might just be another person in the crowd. If I couldn\u2019t remember other people\u2019s faces, they probably wouldn\u2019t recognize mine, either.\nPlus school started becoming harder, too.\nI graduated as the valedictorian of my high school. Everyone knew me as the smart girl who took several college level courses starting freshman year. In class I led discussions because other students seemed to speak up.\nBut I\u2019m one of many valedictorians at Penn State. Everyone brings something new to the table and class discussions. It never occurred to me that others would have much to say in class once I got to college.\nIt\u2019s really easy to stand out in a small town. Word spreads really fast, and everyone finds their niche. People know you as the person who \u201cdoes that thing,\u201d whatever it may be. No matter who you are, people assign you to a niche.\nOne of my niches in high school was color guard. I tried out for the Blue Band and I got in. The color guard (silks, as they\u2019re called at Penn State) includes around 30 people. That\u2019s five times bigger than the color guard at my high school. I felt comfortable, but as I watched other people forming friendships with one another, I began feeling so left out.\nI worried about not finding a place on campus when I arrived. As a small-town girl, I didn\u2019t want to just become one of the 46,000.\nGoing back to my roots eventually helped me find my niche at Penn State.\nSmall talk makes easy to ask others about their hometown. Most of the time when people found out that I\u2019m from Virginia they would shrug and say \u201ccool.\u201d Some people asked about the University of Virginia. I\u2019d tell them that I applied and had been accepted, but Penn State suited me better. It impressed everyone. They would rave about my acceptance to UVA when I thought nothing of it. Virginia was just home for me.\nI lived in an area on campus where only two upperclassmen also lived, which made me feel even more isolated. One of them had a car, though. She would always talk me home from practice so I wouldn\u2019t walk alone in the dark.\nHer kindness gave me my first great friend in college just because we lived close to each other.\nFrom there I continued to find more people I connected with.\nThe people who fawned over my acceptance to UVA probably don\u2019t remember those five minutes at all. But I do. This marked one of the first times I felt accepted at Penn State, like I truly belonged in this large community. I remembered what made me special, even if everyone around me accomplished great things themselves.\nStay true to who you are instead of trying hard to impress everyone. Being a try-hard doesn\u2019t get you far. Transitioning from a small down to a huge college taught me that you can\u2019t be hung up on everything everyone else does.\nStanding out in a small town is great. But taking the time to focus on yourself and your diverse interests on a big campus feels even better.\nNext Post: Did I Chose My College or Did My College Chose Me?"

They offer the best deal and best place to live. It's a basic apartment house with about a hundred people living here, and they're all very amenable, so it's nice to live here with all the whole bunch of people. The staff is very nice, and there's 40% men which is higher than most places. The food is very good; we had spaghetti and meatballs today. The cost was the lowest I've found, and it's centrally located to everything I'm looking at. It's close to everything I want to go to, like to church and when visiting other people.\nWe went to Chateau de Boise, and I think it was very cordial and friendly. It was a little bit dated. They did not have a full kitchen, and my father is looking for a full kitchen. The staff was fine.\nMy mom moved into Chateau de Boise. I think it's a really good community, the people are extremely friendly, they're very helpful, and I think their sales staff is very good. They explained all of the costs, the fees, and I think that aspect went pretty well. My mom thinks the food is pretty good. When we moved in everything was painted and re-carpeted, and it was very nice. I had to do some extra cleaning on the heater and air-conditioning unit, but that was OK. Other than that, we are still waiting on one lightbulb. I think the residents are really caring, they watch out for each other, and I think it's a really good, family environment.\nChateau de Boise is not a place where I would want to live. It was kind of old and I wasn't comfortable there. The staff was friendly enough, but the interview wasn't all that great. He seemed to be encouraging me more to eat there and the only people that were in the dining area had walkers and wheelchairs. The food wasn't that good. The place seemed to be dark, dingy, and it had an old feeling. It was like being in a nursing home. The staff member was cordial, but the interview was very short. I had to wait 15 minutes for him to become available and yet I had an appointment with him. I just was not impressed.\nHi Melody, thank you for providing us with feedback of your recent tour at Chateau de Boise. We are always aiming to please our residents and guests and are sorry we didn't live up to this. We have shared your comments with our management team. Please let us know if you have any additional questions. Have a great day!\nI'm currently living at Chateau de Boise, and it's great. I really like it here, the price is fair, the manager and staff are friendly, and the people are all friendly. The food is good, it's just that it gets old after a while. They have more activities than you can do in a day. They have Bingo, horse races, dominoes, bean bag baseball, coloring, and we usually go to movies on Tuesdays. They have fire side reading, they have bible study classes, and they have people coming in every week who do stuff.\nI liked Chateau de Boise because their dining was in a large, open, oval-shaped room, with lots of oval-shaped windows. You get a feeling of the outdoors while dining. I know several people there, and it's more of a homey atmosphere rather than an institution atmosphere. Everyone was extremely helpful and friendly. They have a workout/fitness center, Bridge, and other activities I want. I especially liked the ground floor, they have sliding doors, and you can just take your pet right out the door.\nI liked everything I saw in Chateau de Boise, everybody seemed happy. The apartments looked fine, and the dining room looked clean. Everybody was getting ready for activities, and they were taking the residents on a bus trip to Jackpot. The staff that I met seemed friendly, and everything looked clean and nice.\nChateau de Boise was an awesome place. The staff was very nice, friendly, and helpful. We ate lunch there, and a couple of residents who sat at the table with us were very nice. It was a very nice place. They got back in touch with me and tried to help me a little bit. The studio apartment was clean and nice. They had a couple of different sizes and layouts. The food and service were good. In the game room, they had a long board on a table with horses on it simulating horse racing, and they were all laughing and had a lot of fun with it. They also had several puzzles set up on different tables. They had a library, room with some exercise equipment in it, a special dining room area to the side if you wanted to have a guest or a birthday party, and a laundry room with ironing boards.\nI toured Chateau de Boise and I liked it. I liked the apartments, but they had no openings at that time. They had a lot of activities. The staff was very friendly and helpful.\nChateau de Boise was very good. The dining area was really clean and easy to get to. The rooms were really nice, good, and clean. They're doing maintenance and taking carpet out of some other rooms, which is good because that means they're keeping them up. Everybody was really nice, and the cleaning ladies know everybody by name and not by room number, which was good. The only thing was that when you first walk in the lobby, it had a funky smell which kind of put me off, but I liked everything else. The grounds were well-maintained, they'll take you to the bank, and there's a bus that'll take you to trips every morning. There were a lot of people sitting and being social in the open areas. There were quite a few women in alcoves playing cards and different places where different people were doing different things.\nMy friend is in Chateau de Boise. I like the living accommodations and the fact that she will have meals, so I do not have to worry about her not eating. I checked many of them before I put her in there, and I liked that one the best. The food is great. She does not have any complaints. She really likes it there.\nI am living in Chateau de Boise, and I love it. I\u2019m one happy camper. It\u2019s a beautiful place, the food is outstanding, and everybody is friendly. The surroundings are very pleasant, and there are a lot of big trees. I have a one-bedroom apartment and a patio with a view of a nice lawn and big trees. All in all, I'm happy where I am.\nThe best way to get to know a community is by scheduling a tour. See the facilities, meet the staff and residents, and get a feel first hand what it's like to live at Chateau de Boise Independent Living.\nResidents at the Chateau de Boise will find numerous dining, shopping and healthcare facilities within minutes of our home.

Our results demonstrate that Opa-proteoliposomes target surface CEACAM receptors on transfected HeLa cells for binding and preliminary data indicate the liposomes are taken into the cells. This internalization is dependent on metabolic energy, suggesting the cells may employ active-uptake mechanisms to internalize the liposomes. Our work shows that Opa proteoliposomes deserve further consideration as a platform for targeted delivery to CEACAMexpressing cells. 2928-Pos Board B305 Mechanism of Interaction between Adenosine Phosphates and Lysenin Channels Sheenah L. Bryant1, Nisha Shrestha1, Paul Carnig2, Samuel R. Kosydar2, Philip Belzeski2, Jason May2, Lauren McDaid3, Daniel Fologea4. 1 Biomolecular Science, Boise State University, Boise, ID, USA, 2Physics, Boise State University, Boise, ID, USA, 3Biology, Boise State University, Boise, ID, USA, 4Biomolecular Science PhD Program/Department of Physics, Boise State University, Boise, ID, USA. Lysenin, a 297 amino acid pore forming toxin extracted from the earthworm E. foetida, inserts hexameric channels in natural and artificial membranes containing sphingomyelin. A distinct feature of lysenin channels is their asymmetric voltage induced gating which occurs at low positive transmembrane potentials. Although the structure of the channel is not yet solved, previous studies of the lysenin monomeric structure and interaction with membranes indicate the presence of local positive charges within the protein\u2019s structure. Consequently, we hypothesized that highly charged organic anions such as ATP, ADP, and AMP may interact with the channel and alter its functionality. Here we show that the macroscopic conductance of the channels was diminished by addition of various adenosine phosphates in a charge and concentration-dependent manner. Single channel explorations have shown a gradual reduction of the ionic currents indicating interaction with absence of gating. Buffer-exchange experiments demonstrated that the current inhibition is reversible, pointing out a potential electrostatic mechanism of interaction between channels and anions which implies binding. This hypothesis was further sustained by analyzing the inhibitory effects of ATP comprising ionic solutions with different ionic strengths. Hill analysis provided further insights into the inhibition process and indicated a positive cooperativity between binding events. In addition, the I-V plots recorded in the presence of increasing inhibitor concentration demonstrate a significant rightward shift of the voltage-induced gating profile. The reduced effects elicited by AMP as compared with ATP and ADP, the reversibility of the inhibition, and the strong dependency of the observed effects on the ionic strength point out an electrostatic mechanism of interaction which may yield partial occlusion of the channels and modulation of the voltage-induced gating. This work sets an example of purinergic signaling that implies modulating the functionality of an exogenous membrane transporter.\nExocytosis and Endocytosis II 2929-Pos Board B306 Imaging the Rapid Recruitment of Dynamins at the Exocytic Fusion Pore Adam J. Trexler, Justin W. Taraska. National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA. The size and shape of the exocytic fusion pore directly modulates the release of vesicle cargoes like insulin, hormones, and neurotransmitters. Though a number of proteins have been implicated in fusion pore regulation, the molecular details of this process and how these proteins work together to shape the membrane are largely unknown. Using TIRF microscopy in living INS-1 cells we directly image the coincident and transient recruitment of dynamin proteins, the regulatory lipid PIP2, and BAR domain proteins amphiphysin, syndapin, and endophilin to exocytic sites. Recruitment occurs at the moment of membrane fusion. Evidence from imaging and siRNA depletion of endogenous dynamins suggests that dynamin-1 and dynamin-2 have distinct functional roles at sites of exocytosis. We show that perturbing dynamin-1 interaction with PIP2 or amphiphysin blocks its recruitment to exocytic sites and has functional effects on vesicle cargo release. We turn to stimulated emission depletion (STED) super-resolution fluorescence microscopy to directly visualize the organization of dynamins at sites of exocytosis in living cells. The spatiotemporal coincident recruitment of dynamins, PIP2, and BAR domain proteins, and their known interactions, strongly suggest these molecules form a complex at the nascent exocytic fusion pore. Such a protein and lipid assembly represents a novel paradigm for controlling fusion pore size and shape and directly modulating endocrine cargo release.\nReport \"Probing the Dimerization Affinity of Visual Opsins\""

The travel suitcase his recruiter recommended he bring sat between his legs. He was hot inside the beat up cattle car that carried Drill Sergeants daring the new recruits to lift their heads. The ride took nearly an hour. Finally, the recruits were released from their mobile holding cell outside of a plain, flat, brick building with no discerning qualities. It looked like every other building surrounding it. Platoons sounded off in the distance, marching and barking in perfect cadence. He didn\u2019t know the man next to him, nor did I.\nUpon exiting the cattle car, he held his newly acquired gear over his head and ran around the three-thousand square foot, two-story barracks building five times just like all the rest. As his arms and knees began to give way under the pressure of the weight, he was ordered inside. The air-conditioning refreshed his resolve and he stood next to a random bunk, the closest unoccupied one he could find. He bear-hugged his gear, feeling it slip ever so slightly as every muscle in his body strained to keep him upright.\n\u201cDrop them on the bunk,\u201d he and his new battle buddies were ordered. Then it was back outside for his first C.A.P.E. \u2013 Corrective Action through Physical Exercise. Apparently, he had already messed up. But it wasn\u2019t today. It was when he signed the recruiting papers and took the Oath of Office before being shipped out to Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. It didn\u2019t take long for him to reveal that he was planning his escape.\nThat night, after lights out, he snuck down to the female first floor window, which we told him was unlocked, and crept his way out. His suitcase had been placed in a storage locker. All he had on was the light gray matching sweats that everyone referred to as \u201cmarshmallows\u201d, unlike the black and grey \u201chigh-speeds\u201d that came with making it out of red phase. He moved fast trying to remember the driving pattern he\u2019d memorized in the cattle car. He found a sidewalk and followed it along in the bush until a spotlight temporarily blinded him. An MP swaggered up while another stood behind his half-opened door with a grin on his face as he chewed his gum excessively.\n\u201cWhere you off to, recruit?\u201d asked the gum chewer with a chuckle.\n\u201cLook. We can either make this easy or we can wake people up. Which would you prefer?\u201d the chewer snapped without missing a beat on his gum.\n\u201cNew, huh? When did you get in?\u201d the politer MP asked.\n\u201cToday.\u201d There was no use lying this time around. He\u2019d been nabbed.\nWith that, the boy laid down in the backseat looking up at the blue plastic roof trying to concentrate on right, right, left, right.\nWith each failed attempt at escape he updated his map and told 4th platoon all the details of his run-ins with the MPs.\n\u201cAren\u2019t you just making things worse for yourself?\u201d I asked at the back of formation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth it,\u201d he said.\nWith each new attempt, he was sure to say good-bye to the females before hopping out of the window. With each dawn, he was back in formation. I never knew his real name even though it was sewn to his right breast pocket. None of us did, except maybe the Drill Sergeants. But even they picked up on our nickname for him as \u201cThe Running Man\u201d. I never knew why the night watch never reported the window unlocked until the company made it into white phase and got our first weekend pass. What I know now is that we follow the sidewalk straight from our barracks, pass the dining facility, turn left and walk straight out the main gate.\nThe Running Man is long gone, recycled over and over again to a new company in their first week of red phase. Phases don\u2019t mix. Companies don\u2019t mix. I wondered if he ever made it out \u2013 out of the gate, out of basic training or out of the Army. The last I heard, he never stopped running."

Coleman III had been charged with one count of kidnapping, resulting in death.\nJassy Correia left a Boston nightclub and was found dead days later. Now a suspect is facing charges.\nBOSTON \u2013 Louis Coleman III has been charged today in federal court in Boston with the kidnapping of Jassy Correia, who had been missing since Feb. 24, 2019.\nColeman, 32, of Providence, R.I., has been charged with one count of kidnapping, resulting in death. Coleman was arrested on Thursday, Feb. 28, 2019, in Delaware and will appear in federal court in Delaware on Monday, March 4 at a time to be determined. He will be transferred to Massachusetts at a later date.\nAccording to the charging document, after learning of the disappearance of Correia, law enforcement reviewed surveillance tape from outside of the Venu nightclub, the last place Correia had been seen by her friends, which showed Correia leaving the area and entering a vehicle with a man later identified as Coleman. Surveillance footage from Coleman\u2019s Providence, R.I., apartment building showed Coleman, at about 4:15 a.m. on Sunday, Feb. 24, 2019, parking and exiting the vehicle, and then returning a short time later carrying a blanket. He then walked from the car to the front of the building carrying a body with long hair and clothing consistent with the description of Ms. Correia. Once he entered the building, surveillance video showed Coleman dropping the victim on the floor and dragging her towards the elevator, and subsequently towards his apartment unit. The victim was not moving and her body was limp.\nIt is alleged that on Feb. 26, 2019, surveillance video from the defendant\u2019s apartment building showed Coleman enter the apartment building with Walmart shopping bags. Law enforcement subsequently obtained video surveillance and a receipt from a Walmart in Providence, R.I., that revealed Coleman had purchased three Tyvek suits, duct tape, two candles, electrical tape, one mask, surgical gloves, two pairs of safety goggles, an odor respirator and CLN release bleach bath.\nAt approximately 9:58 p.m. on Feb. 27, 2019, Coleman is seen on video surveillance entering the apartment building with what appeared to be a new, large suitcase. At 1:15 a.m., on Feb. 28, 2019, Coleman is seen in the video wheeling the suitcase away from his apartment unit towards the elevator, eventually out of the building and into the parking lot where his vehicle was. Coleman appeared to have difficulty lifting the suitcase into the trunk of his car.\nLater in the day on Feb. 28, 2019, a search warrant was executed at Coleman\u2019s apartment, where two packages of hooded coveralls and two respirator masks were recovered. A sofa with four large cushions, one of which was missing a cover, was also observed. In a dumpster outside of the apartment complex, white trash bags, a bag containing plastic sheets, men\u2019s jeans with bleach stains and a belt, a white nylon hooded coverall, an empty box of baking soda, clear safety goggles, a respirator mask, duct tape packaging, rubbing alcohol, Walmart bags, used plastic gloves, an empty package from a car air freshener, three empty packages of purifying charcoal and a sponge were recovered.\nOfficers discovered the victim\u2019s body in the trunk of Coleman\u2019s vehicle, wrapped in a sofa cushion cover, which was inside of a black trash bag, inside of a large suitcase that matches the suitcase Coleman was observed bringing into his apartment on Feb. 27, 2019. The victim had significant bruising, a bloodied face, was bound with gray duct tape, and was covered in what is believed to be baking soda.\nA duffle bag, a pair of new long-handled loppers, plastic garbage bags, clothing, a red plastic gas container, a green butane lighter, black gloves, charcoal air purifiers, air fresheners, tinted safety glasses, plastic Walmart bags, work towels, cloth work-gloves, a new set of DeWalt pliers, a laptop, a computer hard-drive/tower, and disinfectant wipes were also recovered in Coleman\u2019s vehicle.\nIt is further alleged that photographs of the defendant\u2019s vehicle depict a windshield that is cracked in two locations on the passenger side and a white substance, believed to be baking soda, in the trunk of the vehicle.\nThe charge of kidnapping resulting in death provides for a sentence of death or life in prison. Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\nUnited States Attorney Andrew E. Lelling; Boston Police Commissioner William G. Gross; Joseph R. Bonavolonta, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Boston Field Division; John Gibbons, U.S. Marshal for the District of Massachusetts; Suffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins; Colonel Nathaniel McQueen Jr., Delaware State Police; and Colonel Hugh T.

Canadian Luka Magnotta, 32, has admitted to killing Jun Lin, 33, videotaping his acts and mailing parts of the body to elementary schools and to two political parties. He is pleading not guilty due to mental illness. The footage was shown to a jury in a Montreal courtroom where Magnotta is on trial on Thursday, but wasn't released to the media until Monday. Grainy footage taken from four security cameras on May 24, 2012, showed Magnotta and Lin entering the weathered Montreal apartment building, which overlooks a busy expressway. Over the next day, Magnotta is repeatedly seen entering and leaving the building, carrying and disposing of black garbage bags and a gray suitcase, his trips interrupted occasionally to fix his hair in the entrance mirror. Finally, the video shows him carrying a suitcase containing the headless torso out to the trash. The killing of Lin shocked Canadians and grabbed headlines around the world. Magnotta was the subject of an international manhunt. He was arrested in an Internet cafe in Berlin, where he was reading about himself."

You can top your salad with sprouts, harvest fresh herbs or watch bright flowers bloom even on dull winter days. Gardeners will love that they can start seeds months before the last frost, and the home chef can make wholesome meals with year-round microgreens. With indoor plant lights, children can get involved and learn about nature and build basic skills as they care for their food from seed to supper.\nOur options range from lightweight LED grow lights, which don\u2019t hum or have lamps to replace, to the brightest High-Intensity Discharge lights. With an air-cooled HID system to filter your space, plants thrive with no sunlight at all. Leafy kinds love this efficient option, as it produces the most light per watt and doesn\u2019t cast a colored glow. That means it\u2019s ideal in a living area, too. High Pressure Sodium bulbs last even longer and produce light that works well for flowers.\nIf you\u2019re just about to begin, fluorescent grow lights are more budget-friendly. Some crops prefer their softer glow, which is perfect to boost low sunlight. A plant lamp with a reflector helps bounce light further so you can expand your garden later.\nWill you transplant seedlings outside? Start them in an egg carton in your indoor greenhouse. When planted, the carton will break down in the soil, but until then they\u2019ll nestle right under your gardening light."

The huge space was expertly decorated with garland, wreaths, a towering Christmas tree and a live nativity scene with all the usual characters in their designated places \u2014 including real animals.\nAccompanied by a full orchestra, we spent the evening singing well-known carols, being entertained by short \u2014 and sometimes funny \u2014 sketches, and listening to familiar gospel readings about the birth of Jesus.\nToward the end of the service, the worship leader instructed us to take up the candles we were each handed when we entered the chapel. As he spoke, the lights gradually dimmed until we were sitting in near darkness. Coming onto the platform from a side entrance, dressed in a flowing white robe and guided by the light of the single lit candle she held, was a teenaged girl. \u201cO, come let us adore Him,\u201d she sang in a beautiful, clear voice that floated over the congregation like a feather on a gentle breeze.\nFollowing the last line of the song, the lights slowly came back up signaling the end of the meeting, cueing us that it was time to gather our belongings to leave. The worship leader stepped forward one last time to thank everyone for coming. He wished us a merry and blessed Christmas, and reminded us that the good news of Christ\u2019s birth was the essential heart of the message of Christmas. If he had stopped there, it would\u2019ve been fine. But he didn\u2019t. \u201cAs you leave,\u201d he went on to say, \u201cplease be sure to extinguish your candles and place them in the bins by the doors.\u201d While I understood what he meant, the unintended symbolism of what we were being invited to do hit me like a dodgeball thrown by the schoolyard bully. Having just celebrated the very fact that Jesus had come to be the desperately needed light of the world, we were now reentering the outside darkness after intentionally extinguishing the very light we had received.\nI stood there and watched, wondering: How many Christians, Sunday after Sunday, carefully and intentionally leave behind the bright evidence of where they\u2019ve just been and what they\u2019ve just celebrated?\nMy friends, Jesus didn\u2019t come into the world only to be reduced to a sentimental glow enjoyed by insiders huddled away in a sanctuary, hidden from the view of those who need him most. He came to bring the light of salvation to a world desperately groping in spiritual darkness. But that much-needed light of Christ can only glow where we take it.\nSo here\u2019s what I\u2019m asking of each of you: For the rest of this Christmas season, do all you can to make the world a brighter place. Whatever you\u2019re doing, wherever you find yourself, regardless of location, circumstances or surroundings, be sure to let the brightness of Christ shine through you."

Remember, sleep and relaxation are the main things you\u2019ll be doing in the bedroom, and your lighting has to help do just that.\nYou can start with placing LED strips around your bed\u2019s headboard, which can generate a soft, gentle glow. You may also install your strips around the edges and insides of your wardrobe, serving a dual purpose of accent and task lighting.\nGarden Lighting LED light strips to offer a subtle kind of lighting when installed in gardens. They can turn drab outdoor spaces into relaxing areas where you can spend nights out on the patio or in the garden alone or entertaining guests.\nLED strips will work great when installed on paths, or around trees and plants you want to be highlighted. Be sure to stick with LEDs that emit a warm yellow glow, which creates a summery atmosphere in the garden.\nKitchen Lighting LED light strips add a layer of lighting to the kitchen you think you won\u2019t need, but end up thanking yourself when you notice their use. These strips can illuminate specific areas of your kitchen, eliminating the need to switch on the main lights (handy for night time snack trips). They also double as task lighting, especially when placed under and inside cupboards.\nFor more great ideas on using LED strips, hit this LED Luxor page.

                            "text": "Summary: Peter finds something that works, and that\u2019s entirely new.\nThis was a new thing \u2013 something that worked. There wasn\u2019t very much in Peter\u2019s life that did. He chuckled softly to himself; poor little rich boy. Didn\u2019t Daddy hug you enough? Did mother never kiss you good-night? Brother beat you in all the races?\nBut they did. And didn\u2019t. Dad had hugged him, and took what Peter thought had made him special. Mom had kissed him with her kiss of peace, and taken away his brother with her other hand. Nathan, who hadn\u2019t beaten him in everything, if only to make sure that Peter knew that he had cared, one way or another. Cared enough to let go and leave Peter to find what remained of himself, beyond Dad\u2019s cold stare and Mom\u2019s future plotting, beyond Claire\u2019s jump and Sylar\u2019s change of heart and all those other new things that didn\u2019t quite work the way anyone wanted them to.\nPeter fielded calls from Noah Bennet every day as the world changed around them. Not because Peter was any particular genius at these new crises, Noah was the best and they both knew it, but because he was the closest Noah had to a friend nowadays. Another new thing, and one that didn\u2019t quite work either. Peter had begun to wonder if Noah called him just to take the exact opposite of his opinion, as that was most likely to work.\nBut this\u2026 this worked. Emma and him, Sunday afternoon on the sofa, both of them still smelling faintly of the antiseptic scrubs they used at the hospital. Warm and tangled together and uncertain of what they wanted to do, but content for the moment to just breathe the same air.\n\u201cWe work,\u201d Peter said, and Emma caught his words from his lips. She raised an eyebrow at him, smiling.\n\u201cShould make you work harder. Fix the drip in the sink,\u201d she said, and tapped his nose with her finger. Peter wondered what that looked like, and his hand glowed as he synced with her ability. Little ripples of blue, like the water they represented, echoed from the kitchen, bouncing off their soft orange rustlings amidst the blankets and cutting through the warm yellow of their breathing.\n\u201cI could do that,\u201d Peter offered, knowing he looked uncertain as he wondered if he could surreptitiously look up, How to fix a leak without making it worse. For dummies.\n\u201cOr we could stay here. Let it take care of itself,\u201d she said. Emma smirked at him, clearly catching his line of thought as easily as if she had telepathy, and Peter just hugged her closer. They both watched the blue wash over the apartment, letting the little imperfection just go its own way.\nEverything didn\u2019t have to be perfect. Another new thought.\nPeter kissed the top of Emma\u2019s head and twined his hand with hers as they watched the faint rose-red beat of their hearts fill the air around them.\nI love this insight into Peter's past and present. Very well written and heart warming. Cheers!\nOh, this! I love this! *smiles* Not just because it's so sweet, but because it feels very believable.\nand all those other new things that didn\u2019t quite work the way anyone wanted them to... Yes, I can see this happening. And I can see Noah and Peter exactly like that. So, it's just so very nice to see that Peter and Emma has something that actually works.\nI'm a sap for a happy ending! This entire fic is lovely and heart-warming. I like seeing something working out for a Heroes character. They all had such rough lives!\nIt's so sweet, and lovely! Peter finally finds something that works its great, specially after the disaster his life's been. Beautiful fic!"

Sometimes, when it seemed there was no place for shelter. Sometimes, when she found a place between rocks and did her best to hug herself into a smaller version of the same person.\nOut there she\u2019d heard a noise. She went searching to find it. She went deep into a place she didn\u2019t know. She went further than she knew where to stop. Each time, she looked back expecting to see something on the path. Each time, she stepped a bit faster. Put her head back forward, back ahead of her. She kept walking.\nIt started to rain. And in this downpour, there was no shelter. There was a tree and two jagged rocks. It wasn\u2019t much. It certainly didn\u2019t shield her from the elements. She began to shiver.\nThe shivering wasn\u2019t so bad. Neither were the raindrops. It\u2019s just when it got to be so that she couldn\u2019t feel anything else.\nLooking through the mist, the sweeping fog, over the landscape there seemed to be something \u2013 a small light probably far off from where she was. Was it worth it to risk it?\nShe hopped out from the rocks and the tree jumping over puddles. Tracing footsteps over fallen logs. Upward, downward, around bends. Avoiding getting stuck in mud as she walked. The earth suctioning her feet into itself.\nA cabin. A small house in this wood. There it was and she could see that it was here that a light was coming from. Seemed familiar, like a place she\u2019d been to before. Closer and closer.\nFootsteps like a prayer. Like pleading. Like some sort of mantra repeated over and over as she stepped and stepped. Her hands were cold. Her teeth chattered uncomfortably.\nAs she neared the place, she wondered if anyone was there, then decided she didn\u2019t care. She knocked on the door, but it opened to an empty room with a single light shining in the window.\nShe took a couple tentative steps inside and then realizing she was staring straight at a bed, her knees gave out. She\u2019d have to crawl the rest of the way. Pulling herself up and into this bed.\nWhispering voices floating through her head. Thoughts that she tried not to hear. Words that made her squeeze her eyes shut as if to resist crying. But it didn\u2019t matter, sometimes tears came anyway. Sometimes she didn\u2019t know what had hurt her. Sometimes, it just was. And it was okay because the rain no longer hit her. She began to feel warmth again. She closed her eyes and turned her head to the pillow and as she breathed a sigh of relief, there was a tightness in her throat. She fell into deep sleep. Water sinking down into the bed from her hair, her shoulders, her back.\nOutside, water dripping down to a beat like the music in her mind."

A bogeyman.\nHollywood snarls and spits, so Marilyn looks over her shoulder and smiles. Men applaud. Hollywood heels.\nNorma breathes a sigh of relief.\nThe match can be put to rest for now."

As she opened the front door she knew that Bobby would be there, waiting excitedly on the other side. He had very acute hearing.\n\u201cI\u2019m home!\u201d she called from the doorway, releasing her shopping load with relief and hurrying into the lounge to envelop Bobby in a big hug.\nMargot then eased into her daily routine. She removed her hat, scarf, coat, tabard and work shoes and placed each into its correct home. She poked the toes of her tired feet into comfy slippers and shrugged into her old friend, the faded red cardigan that hung from the hook inside the cupboard door. It had one button missing but that was OK as the button was safe in the pocket, wrapped in a piece of tissue. As ever, Margot checked that it was there and then, satisfied, she moved into the kitchen and flicked the switch on the kettle. She knew that Bobby had his own routine too. When she was out he spent his day dozing comfortably on his side of the sofa, his favourite place to sit. Next to her, of course. Whenever she picked him up to give him a big hug, Margot could see his imprint in the soft cushion.\nShe made herself busy in the kitchen, carefully putting away the shopping. The tins in the cupboard were stacked according to size, labels facing the front. They were her soldiers, lined up, ready for action. She carefully wiped down the counter top, removing every crumb, real or imaginary and every smear until the worn and faded worktop glistened in the light. She moved the tea bag tin fractionally to the left. That was better. Lovely. Just how she liked it. Always had done since she moved in on her wedding day 34 years ago. She couldn\u2019t abide mess, or messy people. She hummed to herself. Today was a happy day. A laughing day. No tears. No angry scenes today.\nMargot burbled on about some of her customers\u2019 quirky purchases and every time she looked up, there was Bobby, looking right back, hanging on her every word. She could see the twinkle in his eyes, especially when Margot laughed. Margot laughed a lot but sometimes she also got very angry and then things got damaged. Sometimes she cried and laughed at the same time. Margot never knew what each day would bring, the laughing, or the crying or getting angry but she knew that Bobby didn\u2019t mind.\nThe kettle roared away, agitating the water to the boil, angry at its enforced idleness since breakfast that morning. Margot ignored the kettle\u2019s drone and carried on chatting to Bobby across the kitchen counter. It wasn\u2019t much of a conversation but Margot knew he was listening. She knew that he wanted to know all about her day on the minimart checkout.\n\u201cTea?\u201d she called out, followed by her habitual chuckle. Of course she and Bobby would have tea together. That\u2019s what they did every day when she came home. Part of the routine. Margot brought tea for them both and set them down on the low table in front of the sofa. Three sugars for Margot and just the one for Bobby. Well, he was much smaller than her, wasn\u2019t he? Margot flopped down beside Bobby, their sides pressed companionably together. It was so nice to be home. How they both loved those moments of gentle relaxation at the end of Margot\u2019s shift. She slipped her arm around him and gave a sigh of contentment. She picked up the TV times and flipped through it to plan their evening\u2019s viewing.\nShe sipped her tea and took a silver foil pack of pink, sugar-coated pills from her handbag. She popped a couple of her \u201cspecial\u201d tablets out and looked at them in the palm of her hand. Another part of her routine. An important part that the doctor said she must not forget. As if she would!\n\u201c\u2026.or else you may have another of your episodes and we don\u2019t want that now, do we, Margot?\u201d suggested the doctor in that slightly patronising, slightly over-loud voice but Margot didn\u2019t mind.\nObligingly, Margot had said, \u201cNo, we don\u2019t, doctor\u201d even though she had absolutely no idea what actually happened during her so-called \u201cepisodes.\u201d Each one started without warning when she was fully conscious and finished when she regained consciousness. She had no idea what happened in between and no desire to find out. As long as no one got hurt, that was OK with her and broken crockery could easily be replaced. So she slipped the pills down the side of the sofa where they nestled with the scores of others, mingling with a pin, a fluff-covered mint imperial and a pound coin. Part of the routine. She never forgot to do it. The doctor would be pleased. Such a nice young woman.\nMargot dropped off into a peaceful light sleep, her red-cardiganned chest rising and falling gently, Bobby resting contentedly by her side, his clear eyes unblinking. He gazed up at her through the many layers of cling film that Margot had wrapped around him to keep him warm after Margot had noticed one day that he was stiff and cold. He\u2019d been eating the pink pills that Margot hadn\u2019t noticed had slipped through the lining of the sofa to the carpet beneath. He had a sweet tooth. Later, she added extra layers just for extra warmth and kept the heating on. Well, winter was coming on, wasn\u2019t it? The extra layers of wrapping also helped to keep the flies away.\nMargot came round from her sleep. Having a cat was such a comfort she always said as she gently stroked Bobby through the plastic. He crackled with contentment as she tickled him behind the ear. She sipped her tea, poured into her saucer, cold now and just how she liked it. She didn\u2019t notice a tiny but well nourished fly that wriggled free from between the layers and zig-zagged its bloated way across the room to settle lazily in the fruit bowl. Meat course over, now for the fruit.\n\u201cRight, well this won\u2019t do, will it, Bobby? Time for tea, I think.\u201d Margot stood up briskly and walked into the kitchen.\n\u201cWhat would you like tonight, Bobby? Your usual, I expect, eh? \u201c She opened the cupboard and took out two small tins.\n\u201cPilchards or tuna? \u201c She held up the tins and looked at Bobby and Bobby looked back. \u201cTuna, pilchards, pilchards,tuna?\u201d She juggled the tins from hand to hand.\n\u201cOK, tuna it is.\u201d She placed the tin to one side.\nMargot picked up the spare tin opener and the tin of pilchards. She crossed the room and leaned over her husband of 34 years, sitting silently in his armchair, eyes wide open and fixed on the blank television screen."

I don&apos;t intend to go darker than that.\nShe approaches, closer than she\u2019s ever been before, hovering inches from me. I feel the air grow still between us. I shut my eyes tight. I wish she would hug me, but I know she can\u2019t, and that thought brings on a fresh wave of tears.\n\u201cOh, I can hug you,\u201d she says, as if she heard me.\nI look at her in shock. Before I can react, I see her reach out, and push herself forward. And slowly, I feel my body warm, and my breathing slow.\nI try to speak, to tell her. Instead, my legs buckle, and I fall to my knees. I sob for what feels like forever as I replay fifth grade in my head.\nMeeting her on the second day because she\u2019d broken her wrist the weekend before. The shyness in her voice. After school in her bedroom, working on homework with the door open so her mom felt okay about \u201chaving a boy over.\u201d The kisses we snuck anyway, near the end.\nAnd then the hospital smells.\nAnd then the long, slow ending.\n\u201cDo you have any fond memories?\u201d she asks.\nRebecca\u2019s voice wordlessly murmurs behind my thoughts.\nThe back of my throat tightens and burns; before I can push the memory down, I feel the tears in my eyes and on my cheeks, evaporating in the dry winter air. I gasp as my final attempt at pushing her back down fails.\nI can see her concern even through my tears as she approaches.\nI fall behind when she floats through a tangle of branches that I have to go around.\n\u201cI wish I remembered more about being alive,\u201d she says after I catch up to her.\n\u201cDo you remember anything?\u201d I ask.\nAs we make our way deeper into the forest, I notice she moves in fits and starts; pausing, then charging ahead, only to lose the scent and drift before pausing again.\n\u201cWhen did you live?\u201d I ask during one of her pauses.\nShe squints and tilts her head, considering.\nHer eyes dart, and she glides away again before I can respond.\n\u201cAre you\u2026?\u201d I ask tentatively. I\u2019m not sure how to broach the subject, even though she was so up front with it yesterday. It seems somehow a little rude to ask the dead about their graves, even if they\u2019ve expressed no apprehension about it.\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure it\u2019s here?\u201d I ask.\nI\u2019m up with the anemic dawn, and out the door as soon as I finish a bowl of cereal to appease my mother. I sprint to the edge of the empty hayfield, and stand at the threshold, catching my breath. Rebecca says nothing as I step past the first row of trees, and let the woods envelop me.\nI think about calling out for her, but without a name, the idea seems a little silly.\nAnd then she\u2019s in front of me, smile glittering.\nI hear my name, rattling between the trees, calling me home for supper.\nShe smiles. \u201cI\u2019d like that a lot,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll find you.\" Her voice sounds so close, it jars me for a moment.\nI make my way slowly back to the house, new and old voices mingling in my mind.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in there?\u201d I ask. It\u2019s nearly dark, but the clearing is still bathed in honey-light.\nShe reaches out as if to hug me, but pauses. Her expression falls and she slips back a step.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she murmurs, her smile returning a bit.\nHer smile broadens. \u201cI\u2019m glad!\u201d She holds me there a moment, in her gaze; I\u2019m unable to think. She\u2019s real, this ghost. Rebecca whispers, wordless chatter that feels like a warning.\n\u201cIs your\u2026 grave in the woods?\u201d I ask quietly. She nods, but her expression seems uncertain.\nI glance to the clearing; she sees me and shakes her head vehemently.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not in there,\u201d she mutters.\nBefore I can react, she slips back to stand in front of the trunk of a birch tree. She reaches out her arm, and swings it back, then forward again, slowly. I sit up as I realize what I\u2019m seeing.\nHer arm should be hitting the trunk, but it\u2019s not.\nI stand, my tears forgotten, and step over to her. I reach out, and mimic her movements. I wince as my hand hits the trunk.\nGiggling, she glides toward me, through the trunk, and smiles.\nI step back, but my foot catches, and I fall onto the soft undergrowth. Through my tears I see the girl, her expression concerned, genuine. Her legs don\u2019t move as she approaches.\n\u201cAre you okay, Jamie?\u201d she asks, standing over me.\nAt her words, the fear of being tricked surges. I narrow my eyes.\n\u201cYour grave?\u201d I repeat, incredulously.\nI freeze, my mind overwhelmed, Rebecca\u2019s voice screaming.\nI step towards her, but she slides back again.\nHer voice trails off and she looks towards the clearing. I follow her eyes; the clearing is still sunny, the light a golden syrup, cutting angled rays in the air, pouring on the grass.\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for my grave,\u201d she says.\nI jerk my head left, startled, unsure of what I heard. I find myself staring at the eyes of a girl. She leans forward, leaving five steps between us, examining me with nearsighted curiosity. I exhale in relief, and let my fists relax.\nI step forward cautiously, but she slides back as I do, keeping the distance between us.\nI move slowly among the thin trunks, feeling the soft bounce of layered leaves under me. The silence is welcome, calming. I can\u2019t even hear Rebecca\u2019s voice, normally so loud in my head, this deep in the woods.\nI look up, and see branches stretching like skeletal fingers into the pale Sunday afternoon. I shiver with animal fear, but press onward."

Given water and a little room to grow, some good soil and sun, a little unsuspecting nugget can transform into a surprisingly beautiful, unique organism. An organism that exhibits its own evolved characteristics for survival \u2013 as in thistle, poison ivy, stinging nettle all of which we might try to avoid. Or, to our epicurean delight \u2013 watermelon, tomatoes, peppers, eggplant broccoli, basil, beets, alpine strawberries, lettuce, kale, chard and too many other tasty edible plants to mention.\nTo read the seed catalogs, dream of the garden, purchase the seed, hold the packets, is all about pure creative intention and maybe some planning. A beautiful place for the mind and body to dwell, in the sway of imaginative bounty and abundance if, like me, you are OCD about seeds.\nBut the needle skids the record when the shovel hits the dirt. If you\u2019ve been gardening for a while and have planted seeds, you\u2019ll know\u2026 this is where you let go \u2013 in that moment you have the opportunity to concentrate on the transition between what you dream of and what you have. How wide is that void?\nSo there it is, dirt and the newly planted seed, you can\u2019t see it anymore but it\u2019s in there and it is supposed to become something.\nMy daughter loves strawberries. Most strawberries are not planted as seed but are cultivated by cutting off smaller plants along rooting stems or by root divisions. Alpine strawberries, the tiny little fruits that burst with flavor and can be found in woodland areas in the Northern Hemisphere, may be grown from seed. The seeds are microscopic (in my opinion). When planting, there is no way they can be singled out. One must simply scatter hundreds of seeds in a flat and observe what shoots up. The seed must be kept in the dark until the seedlings sprout (according to the directions on the seed package). My daughter who is ten, made the strawberry project her own. She propelled herself into this, dreaming not of lush berry plants with nodding flowers composed of delicate white petals and smiling yellow centers but of things further down the road. Strawberries and vanilla ice cream, strawberry shortcake, strawberry pie and even strawberries right off the plant\u2026 without the cream and sugar.\nThe seedlings came up surprisingly fast, if these were the right seedlings, I wasn\u2019t sure, this was my first time growing these seeds. I peered at them and wondered if the bed had been \u201ccontaminated\u201d with other seeds, weed seeds? They were tiny, and didn\u2019t do anything. They sat there in the flat, petite and undemanding. Not looking for transplant, not really caring about much except being a stem with a teeny tiny leaf or two. After a month of seedling \u201cWu Wei\u201d, we decided to put them in the raised bed outside. Carefully picked apart and inserted into pencil size holes they were swallowed up by the soil. Still, they sat idle as another month went by. This was late April and every time we got a downpour I wondered if this was the rainstorm that would wash them away. While nothing was happening on the surface, much must have been taking place underground. The roots were winding their way about the soil seeking moisture and nutrients. Once the weather got consistently warmer additional tiny leaves appeared.\nMy daughter\u2019s faith in these baby berry plants never wavered. She talked to, and tended her little plants several times a week, weeding and watering with true focus and commitment.\nBy May, the plants were sending up sprigs that would fan out into cute saw-toothed leaves. Yet the Alpine Strawberry plants were dwarfed by their regular sized cousins (also in the same raised bed) so they still looked ineffective and weak.\nAnd then we got a little flower! My daughter watched the flower morph into a tiny yellow/green berry that eventually started to blush pink. With patience she waited until the next day to pick the berry, knowing that flavor comes with peak ripeness.\nThat next evening, she headed out to the raised beds to pick her first strawberry of the season. Unfortunately, something else had gotten there first. The tiny fruit was gone, chewed off of the stem, red bits still attached to its green base, leaving little doubt about what had happened. My daughter has been by my side gardening with me since she was a toddler. She knows the ups and downs of planting a crop. She knows there will be more berries. She still has plenty of faith in her little strawberry plants. She stands undeterred, vanilla ice cream at the ready."

                            "text": "Some impatiens cultivars have a mixture of two colors across their petals.\nGrowing 6 to 24 inches tall, impatiens (Impatiens walleriana) provide numerous blossom colors, from vibrant red to brilliant white. Thriving as perennials in warm U.S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 10 and 11, these plants that are annuals in other zones commonly are grown from seedlings rather than directly from seeds. Following specific instructions when you plant impatiens allows your garden to have the plants' lush cover of deep-green foliage and multiple flowers.\nAlthough impatiens prefer warm climates, they do not grow well in full sunlight. The best location for impatiens is a partially sunny area, but avoid planting them directly under trees. Large tree roots often compete with other plants' roots for nutrients and soil moisture, and impatiens do not thrive in those hostile conditions. Additionally, ensure that the filtered sunlight does not turn into full shade. Spindly stems and poor flowering occurs in impatiens in heavy shade because they cannot photosynthesize as effectively as when they are in filtered sunlight.\nImpatiens seedlings grow best in well-prepared soil. Prior to transplanting them, mix organic matter, such as compost, with the well-drained topsoil where you want to plant the seedlings. Adding a controlled-release fertilizer to the topsoil as you combine it with the organic matter will produce the best growing results. During transplanting, choose spacing wisely so that your impatiens grow low or tall. For example, a 10-inch spacing between plants forces them to spread horizontally as ground cover because the gaps are so large. Alternatively, close spacing prompts impatiens to grow tall so that their leaves reach sunlight for photosynthesis.\nImpatiens seedlings need to be acclimated to the outdoors before they are transplanted to an outdoor garden. In general, the acclimation process requires placing the plants in an outdoor sheltered area repeatedly for progressively longer time spans. This acclimation process prevents shock to the seedlings. Plant the impatiens in your garden during spring when frost is no longer a threat. Their roots need to be covered completely by soil. Water your newly planted impatiens in morning until their soil is moist but not damp. Try to avoid watering impatiens with sprinklers or a watering can late in a day. Wet foliage overnight invites bacterial and fungal diseases to invade impatiens. In general, impatiens need a deep watering once each week during the growing season to encourage root spread and blossom development.\nIf impatiens create fruits after pollination, the fruits eventually explode from internal pressure and disperse their seeds. The dustlike seeds tend to float in the air and away from the immediate area so that the mother plants do not have excessive competition from the offspring. As a result, your garden will not be overrun with new impatiens plants from seeds. Because the seeds are so small, it is best to plant only nursery-bred seedlings so that you do not struggle with trying to cultivate tiny seeds that may not germinate.\nRodriguez, Amy. \"Planting Instructions for Impatiens.\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/planting-instructions-impatiens-63923.html.

                            "text": "Spider plants make wonderful houseplants that are very easy to grow. But did you know that this common houseplant can also produce seeds? Yes, and it\u2019s easy to grow spider plants from seed too! Here are step-by-step instructions for how to collect and grow spider plant seeds, and care for spider plant seedlings.\nI have three large spider plants (Chlorophytum comosum), and they never produced seeds until after I started putting them outside for the summer. Shortly after I brought them inside that first fall, I noticed that all of them were dropping seeds.\nSo, of course I had to collect the seeds and plant them to see if they were actually viable. It was a fun experiment, and I learned a ton about growing spider plants from seed.\nWait, Do Spider Plants Flower?\nMaybe you never noticed this before, but spider plants bloom during the summer. The tiny little white spider plant flowers are insignificant and, when left unpollinated, they will just drop from the plant.\nBUT, when spider plant flowers are pollinated\u2026 Yep, you guessed it, they will produce seeds!\nIn order for a spider plant to produce seeds, the flowers must be pollinated. You can do this yourself, or put your spider plant outside and let the bees do the work for you.\nTo pollinate spider plants yourself, simply take your finger or a cotton swab and gently rub the inside of a flower. Then use the same finger/swab to go from flower to flower, gently rubbing the inside of each one to spread the pollen around.\nIf pollination is successful, then once the flowers dry up and fall off, a bunch of green spider plant seed pods will be left behind. Woohoo!\nAllow the spider plant seed pods to dry out on the plant until they turn brown and start to split open. Once the spider plant seed pods split open, you\u2019ll see black seeds inside. Spider plant seeds are the size and shape of garden pepper seeds.\nTo make it easier to collect spider plant seeds, put the plant in a place where the seeds won\u2019t get lost once they start to fall out of the seed pods.\nYou could also clip or pinch off the spider plant seed pods as they start to split open, and drop them into a paper bag or container. Then shake the container, or gently pinch the seed pods to collect the seeds.\nOnce you collect the seeds, they are ready to plant right away, or you can store the seeds for a short time and plant them later.\nBut spider plant seeds don\u2019t store well, so it\u2019s best to sow them as soon as you can. You can plant each spider plant seed individually, or you can just plant the whole seed pod.\nPlant the seeds as you would any other seed, in a loose seed starting soil mix. The rule of thumb for planting seeds is to plant them twice as deep as the seed is wide. So, for spider plant seeds, plant them about a 1/4\u2033 \u2013 1/2\u2033 deep, then cover them with dirt.\nKeep the soil evenly moist until the spider plant seeds germinate. To help the seeds grow faster, put the seedling tray on a heating mat or over a heat vent (putting seedling trays over a heat vent will make them dry out faster though).\nIn a couple of weeks, you should start to see tiny spider plant seedlings starting to emerge from the soil. It can take a month or so for spider plant seeds to germinate, so be patient.\nSometimes it\u2019s hard to wait to start potting up seedlings, but spider plant seedlings are very delicate. It\u2019s best to wait until they have several leaves before repotting them.\nIt takes several weeks for spider plant seedlings to get large enough to repot (the seedlings in my pictures are way too small for repotting).\nAs your spider plant seedlings start to grow a few leaves, you can begin to fertilize them. Start by giving them a weak dose of fertilizer, and then slowly increase it to full strength as the spider plant seedlings start to grow larger.\nI use (and highly recommend) organic indoor plant food, and an organic compost solution on my seedlings \u2013 they work better than chemical fertilizers and are much healthier for the environment. Fish emulsion also works great, but it can get a little stinky when used indoors.\nYou can continue to use the same fertilizer throughout the life of your spider plants (only fertilize houseplants during the spring and summer months though).\nMy experiment with starting spider plant seeds was a great success. In this experiment, I planted six seeds, and five of them germinated and grew into cute little spider plants. A few of the variegated spider plant seedlings even kept their variegation, which I\u2019m thrilled about.\nMost indoor gardeners have experimented with spider plant propagation by rooting spider plant babies to produce brand new plants. But it\u2019s fun to experiment with different ways to propagate plants, like grow them from seed. Plus you can share spider plant seeds with friends, or trade them for other seeds.\nI have never seen spider plant seeds for sale before, so I\u2019m not sure where you could buy them. But mature plants can produce seeds every year, so if you don\u2019t have a spider plant houseplant of your own, talk to your friends and neighbors to see if they\u2019ll save seeds for you!\nDo you want to learn more about starting your own seeds?

I was given a very small spider plant last year and am hoping that it will set seeds this year so I can see if your experiment works for me too.\nThanks! Good luck, hope you get some spider plant seeds this year.\nGreat post! I didn't know spider plants had seeds. I've always taken cuttings to make more. I'll be on the lookout for seeds this year. Thanks for the tip!\nThank you, and you're welcome! \ud83d\ude42 hope you get seeds this year! Good luck.\nThe key to getting successful seeds its to not seperate the babys. leave them on the plant to encourage more shoots and then you should start getting flowers. dead head the ones that dry out daily as this encourages more flowers and makes pollination almost impossible not to happen. my spider has 11 plus stems currently and is flowering daily with 20/30 flowers.\nCool, thanks for the excellent tips!\nThe tuberous roots are actually only water reservoir roots that is why its important to only water spider plants when the top soil appears to be majorly dry!\nMy spider plant has almost 100 babies and about 75 seeds. It is fall in my zone and I need to know how to store the seeds until spring.\nStore them in a cool dry place. Spider plant seeds don\u2019t really keep well, and will lose their viability quickly. So you should sow them as soon as you can. I wouldn\u2019t keep them stored for more than 4-5 months, at the longest. I\u2019ve never tested how long they will store and still remain viable. Here\u2019s more details about how I store my seeds\u2026 Storing Seeds Spider plant seedlings are just as easy to grow through the winter as the mother plant is though, so even if you plant the seeds in the fall, you can grow the seedlings as you would any spider plant houseplant.\nDo you know of any one that\u2019s sells spider plant seeds?\nI don\u2019t. Sorry! I\u2019ve never seen spider plant seeds for sale before.\nI am 42 years old. I grew up with my mother always having spider plants. My plant had produced flowers!! Mom never saw spider seeds developed before on hers\u2026but when their kept indoors all year long bees can\u2019t access the plant!!!So I used my finger as Mr. bumblebee and just touch my finger from flower to flower back-and-forth several times and it pollinated just fine!!! I\u2019ve heard of using a artists brush to do the same.\nI grew up surrounded my spider plants too! My mom always kept them indoors as well, and they never got seeds. Very cool that you were able to pollinate the spider plant flowers yourself! Congrats!!\nI want to share my experience with my spider plant. It started out as my daughter\u2019s work plant. It was very small & it looked hopeless, but she gave it to me. I leave it out in the summer, & it is so happy & healthy, & very very full. When I brought it in this fall, my spider plant started dropping seeds. I didn\u2019t realize what they were at first, & I was just throwing them away, but after I read the above information I was very excited so I planted all of the spider plant seeds in a small pot. I\u2019m hoping I will get more spider plants. Thank you so much for your help.\nVery cool, I love that story! Thank you so much for sharing. So glad you found this post helpful, and I hope your spider plant seeds will grow great for you!\nWow, interesting. I don\u2019t know for sure why your spider plant doesn\u2019t grow any babies. But my guess is that since the flowers are being pollinated, they are producing seed rather than babies. Do you keep your spider plant outside?\nNo, I keep it inside. However, it did become infested with fungus gnats once. Is it possible that they did the pollinating? I finally got rid of them, thankfully. Thanks for the response. I will enjoy planting those seeds to see what happens.\nHumm\u2026 I guess it\u2019s possible that the soil gnats could have helped pollinate them. But that would have been completely by accident because soil gnats don\u2019t care about flowers. Weirdness. \ud83d\ude42 Glad to hear you have the soil gnats under control!\nSo cool. My mom has these at her house, but I don\u2019t know if she knows you can get seeds from spider plants.\nI had no clue spider plants could have seeds, i know that sounds silly.\nI was wondering how do you pollinate the flowers by hand ?\nI have not put any of mine outside to be pollinated,and yet one of them has a seed pod.\nYes. To pollinate the spider plant flowers you can just use your finger to spread pollen around from flower to flower.\nWhere can I buy spider plant seeds? I volunteer at a community garden and the kids want to grow some indoor plants. I can\u2019t find seeds anywhere. Suggestions?\nI have never found spider plant seeds for sale anywhere before. It would suggest asking around to see if any of your friends have spider plants that you can try pollinating to collect the seeds. Good luck!\nI was gifted a spider plant yesterday\u2026 So I am very excited on how \u201cLucy\u201d will turn out.\nWonderful, enjoy your new baby spider plant!\nOhmygosh! I had no idea there were seeds!! I brought mine in from the back porch in October and it was still blooming! I\u2019ll have to look for seed pods. Do you know anything about growing roses from seed? I picked a seed pod/ rose hip from a very prolific Bush and popped it into a pot of soil and forgot about it. Just noticed yesterday that there\u2019s a seedling growing!\nAwesome! I hope you\u2019ll find some seed pods on your spider plant! How fun that you were able to grow your rose from seed."

                            "text": "When putting together the list of annuals for pots and flower beds, don\u2019t forget to add in some colorful foliage plants. Coleus plants are easy-care, versatile, and their foliage color can only be described as spectacular! Coleus combines well with flowering annuals to create more texture and interest, or it\u2019s a great stand-alone in a container or bed.\nThe botanical name for cultivated Coleus is most often Solenostemon scutellarioides. Sometimes it will be listed as Coleus x hybridus and another synonymous name is Coleus blumei. There is also quite a list of common names: Coleus, Flame Nettle, Painted Nettle, Painted Leaf, and Poor Man\u2019s Croton. The name Coleus comes from the Greek \u201ckoleos\u201d and it means sheath. The name was probably given due to the fact that the stamens, the male portions of the Coleus flowers, are fused into a tube or sheath.\nColeuses are members of the mint family, Lamiaceae. They have the distinctive stems that are square in cross section and are closely related to peppermint, spearmint, salvia, basil, thyme and oregano. Coleus plants are herbaceous perennials in their native habitat, and that could have originally been Africa to Asia and the Pacific Islands. They are frost tender, so in most climates, they are grown as an annual. Coleus plants have opposite leaves and blue to lilac colored flower spikes (most gardeners pinch out the spikes because they are insignificant compared to the beautiful foliage).\nSo, what\u2019s so great about Coleus? Well, it has the most incredible foliage with colors and color combinations that no other plant species can offer. The colors are brilliant and the range in shades is limitless: dark mahogany, browns, greens, yellows, bronze, reds, and oranges. The shapes of the leaves are lovely as well with some being lobed and frilly. The Coleus plants have different growth habits; some are tall and lanky, some branch freely and are compact, and others trail and are beautiful in hanging baskets. There are literally 1000s of forms! Also, if there is a need for shade plants, Coleus is perfect for areas with limited sun.\nPropagation of Coleus plants is fairly simple. Cuttings that are 3 \u2013 4 inches long will readily root even in a glass of water. Coleus seeds are usually found in mixtures, offering several varieties of colors and sizes in one seed mix. Start the foliage plant seeds indoors 8 weeks or so before the last expected frost. Using starter trays or pots and pre-moistened sterile potting mix, the seeds should be placed on the surface and gently pressed into the soil. Covering the pots with glass or clear plastic helps to keep the moisture in the seeds. Keep a room temperature of 70\u00b0 and place the tray or pots in a sunny location, preferably with indirect light as to not dry out the seeds. Remove the covering once germination has started and set the tray in a window where the seedlings will receive 6 hours of sun. The Coleus seedlings can be handled once they have developed 2 sets of true leaves. Harden the seedlings off before planting them outdoors.\nWhen growing Coleus from seeds, it is amazing to watch the genetic expression even in the seedlings. There seems to be an endless variety of color combinations, and the colors are so rich and vibrant. Include some Coleus plants on the yearly list of annuals \u2013 they are guaranteed to thrill!"

This was not an unknowable audience, a demon who she knew nothing about but their name and history. She knew this one. She had kissed him and made him promises, knew his wishes and his limits. He had been watching her with the eyes of someone who loved her, and she had been watching him as well as the person she loved. She did not entirely hate him. She knew with absolute certainty how to call him by name, how to make his name so truly his he could not help but answer.\nSin made her dance slow and easy, her fingers touching the air as if it was water that would ripple at her touch, as if she could make every move, every slow wind of her hips and swing, a caress. She thought about the way Alan held back from touching Nick but held close, the way Mae had come to sit across a room from him and Jamie could laugh at him. She thought of how humans could bend and make room for a demon, learn to welcome a demon in out of the cold.\nShe lifted her hands as if to touch, as if to open a door, and then drew them back.\nShe danced along chalk lines with her enemies outside the door, in glass-torn jeans and a blood-streaked shirt, and she was absolutely certain that nobody could resist drawing near to watch her. A draught from another world raised all the hairs on her neck. Sin did not falter. The door between the worlds swung open further to her, horror leaking out. It felt as if the lines she was standing on were dissolving, as if the human world was crumbling away beneath her feet and soon she would be stranded in the demon world, deserted, lost, drowning in air she could not breathe.\nThe darkness and onslaught of cold fell from her eyes. Light assaulted Sin\u2019s vision instead, coming at her in a blinding, scorching wash. Anzu stood in front of her, limned in fierce light. It was strange to see him not in Alan\u2019s body, not with a body at all. The form in front of her seemed unreal as a mirage, pale as someone who had died, his eyes glittering as if they were shards of glass she had broken.\n\u201cBut it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Sin told him.\nShe could feel him along the lines of connection and communication, feel the cold weight of his demon\u2019s thoughts leeching her of every emotion she had. She felt all the icy rage she had expected, like knives sliding in under the surface of her skin and peeling it away from the bone. She felt something else as well: a mess of other things she, being human, could not quite recognize or untangle from the rage. Not all of them hurt.\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Sin asked, low. She did feel sorry for him. He could tell, and she could feel more of his fury, and something like surprise, slicing through her flesh. There was greed too, with demons there was always greed, as if he wanted to drink up her emotions and drain her dry.\n\u201cGo ahead and kill me,\u201d said Sin, and three magicians burst into the room. Black magic erupted from one magician\u2019s hands, leaping for her like a shadow trained to attack. A curtain of light was dropped before her eyes, so suddenly she did not immediately know what it was, and then she knew it was Anzu\u2019s wing, shielding her, absorbing the magical blow. After a moment the curtain lifted, and she could see. She already had a knife in her hand."

Catherine Tobler was born on the other side of the International Dateline, which either gives her an extra day in her life or an extraordinary affinity when it comes to interdimensional gateways. Her fiction can be found in Clarkesworld Magazine, The Mammoth Book of Steampunk, and Fantasy Magazine. She is the senior editor of Shimmer Magazine and calls Colorado home.\nThe yellow light in the cracked green window flickered and then by degrees began to grow dim, throwing the thing that sat on the warped porch into shadow. Wind stirred leaves; they rustled like paper, dry and ready to ignite with the smallest spark. Cold rain forestalled that.\n\"Jumbo gumdrop serenade, sweet serenade.\" Nesta scooped the bundle from the wet porch and hustled it inside. She kicked the old door shut behind her and hopped from her left foot to her right as she approached the long table. Splinters danced in her toes.\nChanarasanda snapped her fingers. \"Here, here, and there, bring it here.\" She held her hands out and fingers flapped against palms. \"Here and there. Here. There.\"\nNesta giggled and Chanarasanda blew on the lamp, giving air to the starved flame. It grew, a long yellow tongue to lick the glass which contained it.\nMiluchra peered over the table's edge, ruby eyes reflecting the flame she'd brought. She rubbed hands together and small sparks shot between her blackened palms. She, too, reached for Nesta's bundle, but Nesta handed it only to Guinhumara, who placed it in the barrel of still water on the table.\nThe four women watched the bundle sink through the water with a gurgle. The bundle absorbed the liquid and sank fast. Bubbles rose in a shimmer, popped on the surface with air kisses. Guinhumara's fingers danced through the bubbles; she lifted her middle finger to her mouth to taste of the brew.\n\"Round and soft, what do we make of it tonight?\" she asked, dipping her finger in for another sample. Water glistened on her lips. \"Wet and tasty.\"\nMiluchra ducked beneath the table. She came back up with a black leather pouch. With her long-fingered hand she flicked it toward Nesta who was nearest. Nesta rolled the pouch in her hands.\n\"A stink of bowels, of deepest earth. My womb, my shell--what is its worth? You, Chanarasanda, blow till the foul thing takes flight.\" Nesta's dark eyes narrowed as Chanarasanda blew. Wind whipped Nesta's earth-dark hair from her shoulders. \"Sweet tumult.\"\nIn the air between them dark granules joined together in a whirlwind. Chanarasanda ceased her blowing and the grains dusted gently over the surface of the water. One bubble emerged from the bundle within, breaking with a peacock's mating cry and the smell of fire.\n\"Such a stink, sweet stink,\" Nesta whispered and patted the smooth black fall of Miluchra's hair.\nGuinhumara tapped Nesta's hand with her fringed cane. \"Did you bring anything?\"\nNesta pulled a pink flower from her headdress. Above the barrel of water, she rubbed the flower between her fingers till pollen scattered the water's surface, till the petals bent under the pressure and yielded a pink rain that smelled of apples. Nesta dropped the remains of the petals into the water and Guinhumara stirred the mass with her fingers.\n\"It grows,\" Chanarasanda said and beneath the water, the thing stirred.\nThe wrappings, like fallen sails, moved in the water; a body, a hand, toes, briefly visible under the wet fabric. A great belch rose from the barrel and water scattered over the four women.\nGuinhumara closed her eyes and sucked the water through her skin. The water sizzled against Miluchra's flesh, vapor in seconds. Nesta lifted her arms and drank the rivulets of water, while the wetness was blown from Chanarasanda as if by a hard spring wind.\n\"Attend,\" Guinhumara said and all four women stood.\nThey joined hands around the barrel, bare feet placed flat against the rough wood floor. They encircled the table, round around square, and with fingers entwined, attended the thing in the barrel. It rolled in the water, splashed, and bellowed until another bubble rose and broke. A cat's plaintive wail.\nMiluchra's flame was doused, but under her concentration, rose anew to burn brighter. Guinhumara leaned closer; water flecked her face and vanished. The thing in the barrel snatched a hand out, grabbed the ribbons on the edge of Guinhumara's crescent hat, and pulled it off. The hat vanished into the tub with a gurgle, Guinhumara's bald head reflected as the water stilled.\n\"A grippy thing,\" Nesta whispered, meeting Guinhumara's steady aquamarine gaze. \"What is this thing, this jumbo gumdrop porch present, unliving but now grippy for Guinhumara's hat?\"\n\"Mischief never hurt us.\" They all looked at Miluchra, the quiet one who now spoke. Her eyes glimmered with fresh fire, fire uplifted by Chanarasanda's softly blowing expression. Strands of auburn hair on Chanarasanda's head, blowing, kindly blowing, giving air to Miluchra's ever-warm flame.\nNesta giggled and the ground beneath them shook. Her toes gripped the floor, aching for the touch of sweet spring dirt. Soon-soon, my sweet womb; patience for the victory.\n\"What do we make of it, tonight?\" Guinhumara asked.\nOn the heels of her question, the thing emerged from the water, pearl-white fingers gripping the edge of the barrel. The wet wrappings clung to its round head, turned the room dark, and made it blind. It slipped in the water, arrived with a landed-fish splat on the flat table. The four women leaned closer and Guinhumara plucked the wrappings off the wriggling creature.\nEarth-colored eyes blinked back at them, fire-red lips puckered in a blown kiss. Water spewed out of that sweet mouth and then a belch of seaweed air.\n\"We did not make this,\" Chanarasanda said, pressing a finger into the dough-soft belly. Air escaped the creature's other end.\n\"A stink of bowels,\" Nesta said. \"Of deepest earth. Silly gumdrop serenade.\" She touched a small white toe and the creature giggled and kicked. Nesta cocked her head and smiled. \"Pretty pony parade.\"\nMiluchra touched the small tumescence between the chubby legs. The kicking stopped; the earth-eyes widened and a stream of water shot toward Guinhumara's regal nose."

From gusty winds, Savanna Burke refers to as Male Gales, to a mixture of sleet, ice and once in a great while, snow. This winter, Savanna\u2019s found the island winds are bringing change, for her, and for Terence Whittaker, Galveston Island\u2019s well-known clairvoyant.\nSavanna was only half-listening to the couple in front of her and Roth. She was trying to find a polite way to excuse herself. She wanted to find Terence before the ladies dressed in red took the floor. She definitely didn\u2019t want to dance with anyone but him when the song played.\nAn unnerving feeling washed across her and a slow tingle slid its way down her spine. She felt as though someone was watching her\u2014intently. Turning around slowly, Savanna felt as though she was being pulled by a magnet, everything inside her quivering in response.\nWhen she faced the opposite direction, she breathed out a soft laugh and her lips parted in the beginning of a smile.\nTerence was walking toward her, smiling at her in return. His smile broadened and he did a little Samba move at her.\nSavanna laughed, loving that he wanted to play, tease her. She stepped forward, her hips swaying, matching Terence\u2019s moves.\nTerence held out his hand as he reached her, capturing hers in his own. Slowly, he raised her hand to his lips, kissing the backside, then turning it over, he kissed the inside of her palm, his mouth lingering.\nShe nodded. Her breath so tight she couldn\u2019t speak.\nSavanna leaned back and looked up at him. Where on the face of God\u2019s earth had this man come from? What man spoke this way and looked like Gable? This only happened in the movies. And Gable, only happened once in a lifetime.\nAs Terence took her hand, he leaned around her, signaling behind her. Roth, Savanna thought. She\u2019d forgotten all about Roth. She glanced back and saw a wide grin on Roth\u2019s face and knew everything was fine.\nShe wasn\u2019t allowed to linger as Terence guided her through the throng of people. Some spoke to him as they passed, quickly giving her the once over. She took a deep breath, knowing everyone was wondering who she was. And for the first time since she\u2019d arrived on the island, she was aware of how many eyes were going to be on her.\nThe necklace tickled at her back, as she twined through the crowd, reminding her of how striking the dress was. Relieved, she hoped the dress would work the magic Terence and she were looking for.\nCouples waltzed past them, reminding Savanna of scenes from movies. It was the South, in full splendor, carrying forward the tradition of balls and galas. She closed her eyes and shook her head lightly. It was like a dream, something out of a postcard.\nA tall blonde danced by in the arms of a handsome man. She smiled in their direction, blew Terence a kiss and waggled her fingers at Savanna.\nThe orchestra\u2019s strains lowered, signaling the end of \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d and the dancers slowed, winding down, drifting to the perimeter of the dance floor.\nThe emcee\u2019s voice carried above the dulcet tones of the music as he announced the changing of the colors.\nTerence still had his arm around her waist and he smiled down at her as the music began. The harp led first, the sweeping sound of the strings like something from heaven as it called to the dancers.\n\u201cThe Lady in Red\u201d had never been played with such a haunting quality.\nTerence stepped forward, his hand leaving Savanna\u2019s back as he turned, facing her, leading her onto the floor. He kept just enough distance between them to allow everyone to see her, as he slid into a slower version of the Samba he\u2019d danced with her earlier.\nSavanna looked at this man, guiding her, enticing her, smiling at her as if only she was in the room. Her lips parted in delight once more as she watched the dance of seduction Terence was tempting her with, and suddenly, she decided to meet the challenge, give the man an answer.\nMatching his rhythm, Savanna\u2019s hips moved provocatively, and she felt the necklace at her back swaying with the movement. Terence\u2019s eyes lit behind his mask and he drew her closer, one step at a time, their hips moving in sync until the distance between them closed. Completely.\nSavanna could feel Terence\u2019s hips against hers, his thighs so tight against her own, it was as though there was no fabric between them. And they danced, around and around, in their own version of a Samba, as they circled the floor. With a change in rhythm, Terence eased her from the Samba moves into a slow waltz, his hand finding its familiar place on her lower back.\nAnd the cameras flashed. Again and again.\nOther dancers slid past them, but Savanna barely noticed, there was only Terence and the feel of his hand on her back. And the flashes of light.\nTerence placed his mouth against her ear once more, murmuring the words to the song, sending a new thrill down her back.\nLoretta Wheeler lives in the south along with her Australian husband, their cat Lil\u2019 Dickens, and their dog, Jack. Both pets are rescued fur-persons who are very much loved.\nMost of Loretta\u2019s writing is set in southern locales, whether in the thriller or romance genre. She says she writes of southern things because most of her stories speak to her in a southern accent. Something she recognizes easily since her own is so strong."

Read previous excerpts here and here.\nThursday arrived and Mary breezed into work. But even then, the minutes ticked off slowly as Mary anticipated her luncheon meeting. Finally, at 11:30, Mary grabbed her coat and headed out the door. It was only three blocks from her office to the deli. With the sun shining, Mary walked briskly down the street, her enthusiasm putting a bounce in each step. As Mary grabbed the door handle, she noticed Dr. Scott a half block away. Mary waited.\n\u201cThank you so much for meeting me. I am so grateful,\u201d Mary blurted out.\nAs Mary scanned the menu, she could see the tables beginning to fill up. They both ordered quickly, and settled in to wait for their meals.\n\u201cAs I recall,\u201d Dr. Scott started, \u201cyou were always one with an open mind. No matter how many times I challenged you to do better, you did. So it was funny you would call the day you did. I was opening my mail when the phone rang and had just received an invitation to the best human resources training program ever. It\u2019s in the evenings, right during my HR308 class. Believe me, this program would be perfect for you. It meets twice a week at the downtown YMCA and runs for five weeks.\nDr. Scott slid a simple tri-fold brochure, black ink on white paper, over to Mary.\nMary was confused. \u201cThe \u2018best human resources training program\u2019 came on a simple black and white brochure in a class down at the Y?\u201d Mary thought to herself. Mary took the brochure from Dr. Scott and read the front of the flyer. Now Mary was even more confused.\n\u201cPottery?! Dr. Scott, this must be a mistake.

She will study the highest-risk subtype of medulloblastoma, with the goal of understanding the possible role of translational control in this cancer. She will test both novel and existing mTOR inhibitors as a potential therapeutic strategy for patients.\nProject title: \"Understanding the role of translational control in humanized mouse models for medulloblastoma\"\nLeptomeningeal metastasis, or spread of cancer cells into the spinal fluid, is a devastating complication of cancer resulting in rapid neurologic disability and death. With little mechanistic information to guide treatment decisions, efforts at treatment are too often futile. To address this critical knowledge gap, Adrienne will employ a translational approach to analyze patient samples utilizing multiple, complementary, orthogonal molecular strategies as tools for discovery. This approach will be coupled with hypothesis-driven mouse models to assemble coherent molecular mechanisms that describe cancer cell interactions with their microenvironment. This mechanistic work will suggest new targets for therapeutic intervention, paving the way for novel treatment approaches. Dr. Boire works under the mentorship of Joan Massagu\u00e9, PhD, at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.\nProject title: \"Molecular determinants of leptomeningeal metastasis: a translational approach\"\nBrain metastases are the most common tumor in the brain, most frequently originating from melanoma and carcinomas of the lung and breast. Of patients who develop brain metastases, approximately half succumb to the cancer in their brain. Unfortunately, treatment options are limited, and most current clinical trials in the US exclude patients with brain metastases. Dr. Brastianos recently completed a large study to understand the genetic changes that occur in brain metastases. She identified genetic alterations in brain metastases that predict sensitivity to targeted therapies. She will conduct a biomarker-driven Phase 2 study to evaluate targeted therapy in patients with brain metastases harboring specific genetic alterations. Her research will incorporate cutting-edge genomic technology and animal models to understand predictors of response, as well as resistance to targeted therapies. As most genomically guided trials in cancer have excluded patients with active brain metastases, this represents a potential paradigm shift in the management of patients with brain metastases.\nProject title: \"Investigation of novel targeted therapeutic approaches for brain metastases\"\nDr. Chang is investigating the role of activity-regulated gene expression in human brain evolution. Activity-regulated pathways control critical brain functions and modulate tumor growth in multiple cancers. These pathways are broadly conserved across all mammals, but newer studies have identified features that are unique to primates and may influence important aspects of brain function and tumor progression. Dr. Chang will study the function, regulation, and evolution of primate-specific genes. Through these experiments, she aims to uncover molecular insight into what makes humans susceptible to cancer.\nProject title: \"The role of activity-regulated gene expression in human brain evolution\"\nGlioblastoma remains the most aggressive brain tumor diagnosed in patients, and it is clear that new treatment strategies are needed. There is significant optimism around the use of approaches that stimulate a patient's immune system to treat brain tumors. Gavin focuses on identifying the specific components of a patient's brain tumor that the immune system recognizes and determining whether there are regional differences in this immune recognition. He hopes that this work will increase our understanding of how the immune system recognizes brain cancers and will increase our understanding of how to rationally design personalized vaccines to treat these tumors.\nProject title: \"Characterizing the immunogenic landscape of glioblastoma\"\nDr. Maus is engineering the body's own immune T cells to fight deadly brain tumors like glioblastoma. However, in studies of patients with brain tumors, she has found that tumor cells can escape the engineered T cells. She is now redesigning T cells so that they block escape routes used by the tumors. She expects that the engineered cells will be more powerful and may become a new effective treatment for brain tumors. The engineered CAR T cells are designed to target cells displaying multiple abnormal proteins (antigens) made from cancer-causing oncogenes; theywill act as drug carriers to address the specific hurdles of antigen heterogeneity and penetrating the blood brain barrier. She is testing these \"living drugs\" in vitro and in mouse models with the goal of ultimately advancing these studies to human clinical trials. Furthermore, if this system works for brain tumors, it has the potential to be applied as a therapy for other forms of cancer as well.\nProject title: \"Next-generation CAR T cells for EGFRvIII-positive glioblastoma\"\nDr. O'Brown is investigating the molecular mechanisms that govern the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which acts as the gatekeeper for the brain. While the BBB protects the brain from pathogens and provides the necessary environment for normal brain function, the BBB also acts as an obstacle to drug delivery for the treatment of neurological diseases, including brain tumors. A key regulator of BBB integrity, Mfsd2a, limits transcellular movement across the barrier and therefore prevents leakage into the brain. Using a combination of zebrafish genetics, small molecule screens, and live imaging, she aims to understand how this protein regulates these BBB processes. By investigating the cellular signals that induce or remove barrier properties, she hopes to identify ways by which she can selectively manipulate the barrier to allow for drug delivery to the brain.\nProject title: \"Molecular and cellular mechanisms of transcytosis regulation in blood-brain barrier function\"\nDr. Pfau aims to identify the molecular regulators of blood-brain barrier heterogeneity. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) protects the brain from harmful substances to ensure proper brain function. Consequently, the BBB renders many cancer therapeutics ineffective for treatment of primary and metastatic brain tumors, as drugs that effectively treat cancer in the rest of the body cannot efficiently enter the brain. She seeks to better understand how the BBB functions by characterizing the \u201cwindows of the brain,\u201d regions where the barrier is naturally more open to allow communication between the brain and the rest of the body through the bloodstream. In determining how the BBB is altered in these regions, she anticipates that her work will identify key molecular regulators that the brain naturally uses to open the blood-brain barrier and thus provide insight into how it can be modulated to promote drug delivery to tumors in the brain.\nProject title: \"Investigating the molecular determinants of blood-brain barrier heterogeneity\"\nDr. Sarthy is developing new easy-to-use and affordable methods for studying DNA packaging and epigenetics (modification of gene expression) in pediatric cancers with a special focus on diffuse midline gliomas and neuroblastoma. These methods may help explain the drivers of pediatric malignancies and allow clinicians to better monitor response to treatment with the goal of developing new drugs that restore the cell\u2019s ability to package DNA correctly.\nDr. Taylor is investigating the impact of neural activity on pediatric high-grade glioma (pHGG) invasion. The innate ability of pHGGs to diffusely infiltrate healthy brain tissue is a classical hallmark of the disease, which represents a major contributor to the devastating prognosis. Using optogenetic techniques to stimulate neuronal activity, she will directly and noninvasively test the effect of activity-dependent secreted proteins on tumor cell invasion in human cancer cells and animal models. She plans to confirm the pro-infiltrative effect of candidate proteins on pHGG and subsequently uncover the mechanisms by which they alter the molecular dynamics of the tumor cell. Her hope is to highlight a novel means by which the neural microenvironment drives glioma progression and most importantly identify a new set of therapeutic targets to limit glioma spread.\nProject title: \"The effect of neuronal activity on pediatric glioma invasion\""

                            "text": "\u201cGenomic medicine is already part of mainstream medical care,\u201d says A. Keith Stewart, M.B., Ch.B., in his opening remarks at the sixth Individualizing Medicine 2017: Advancing Care Through Genomics, a conference hosted by the Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine.\nStewart highlighted a new clinical test developed at Mayo Clinic using mate pair sequencing, which identifies genetic defects and chromosomal breaks linked to cancerous tumors. This information can pinpoint exact disease-causing genes, opening up new possibilities of individualized therapies targeted to precise genetic mutations. The test is already making a difference for patients, revealing genetic mutations that offer patients new options with targeted treatments.\nCell-free DNA (cfDNA) tests that identify pieces of DNA shed into the bloodstream by cancerous tumors are offering the hope of tracking cancer as early as possible \u2500 when it is most treatable. Mayo Clinic researchers and clinicians are working collaboratively to develop blood tests ranging from those that detect single changes (mutations) in single genes to those that look for thousands of mutations in hundreds of genes. The first test launched in the clinical lab detects a specific change in the BRAFgene, primarily linked to melanoma. The cfDNA BRAF test offers a convenient, less costly and potentially more accurate picture of cancer activity that can help identify appropriate targeted treatments for advanced disease. Follow-up clinical tests in colorectal cancer, lung cancer and breast cancer will be available shortly.\nDNAs sequencing is being used more commonly in clinical care to solve cases of unexplained medical conditions. Mayo Clinic\u2019s rare and undiagnosed disease program has seen a 30-fold increase in caseload from 2012 to 2016 \u2014 and has surpassed evaluating its 1,500th patient. Genomic testing has revealed a diagnosis in approximately 30 percent of patients, all who had been unable to find a diagnosis with traditional clinical testing. Mayo\u2019s Unsolved Case Team is deploying innovative research strategies to find answers for other elusive diagnoses.\nGenomic sequencing has expanded beyond finding a diagnosis for rare diseases, to include conditions for which there is no definitive cause or cure like chronic liver disease and inflammatory bowel disease. With specialized genomics clinics for many gastrointestinal diseases, multidisciplinary teams of clinicians and researchers are using genetic testing to find a cause and then develop personalized care plans for many conditions.\nWith more than 1.5 million adverse drug events each year as a result of medications, Dr. Stewart emphasized the importance of selecting the right medication for each patient to maximize the treatment benefit and avoid harmful side effects. Pharmacogenomics uses DNA tests to help clinicians select medications that will reduce the risk of adverse side effects and increase efficacy for patients\u2014based on their genetic makeup. Over the past year, Mayo Clinic has led efforts to apply pharmacogenomics testing proactively to improve patient care broadly and in many subspecialties, such as pediatric gastrointestinal disorders, liver disease and neurosurgery.\nIllustrating the benefit of pharmacogenomics testing, Dr. Stewart pointed to his own experience having his genome sequenced which revealed new information about his sensitivity to certain medications.\nAs genomic testing has become faster and cheaper, it is becoming more accessible to healthy people who want to better understand their own health and risk of disease. Whole-genome sequencing looks at a patient\u2019s entire genetic makeup for information on inherited conditions, genetic variants that drive cancer, and links to disease.\nDr. Stewart emphasized how genomic sequencing could help physicians be proactive in screening for and treating many conditions. For example, many inherited cancers are missed with traditional clinical testing. Preemptive genetic testing could identify whether a patient is at risk for an inherited cancer, allowing for more frequent cancer screening and earlier treatment, when it can be most effective.\nDavid Ledbetter, Ph.D., executive vice president and chief scientific officer, Geisinger Health System, echoed Dr. Stewart\u2019s emphasis on the value of preemptive genomic sequencing. Dr. Ledbetter leads Geisinger\u2019s MyCode Community Health Initiative, an innovative research effort that has already revealed lifesaving information for participants. The project will leverage twenty years of electronic health information with DNA sequencing data for each participant to find the best way to deliver cost-effective, precision medicine healthcare within a health system setting. More than 160,000 participants are already enrolled, more than half way to program\u2019s goal of 250,000 participants.\nAccording to Dr. Ledbetter, the program has already saved the life of a 57 year old grandmother and MyCode participant.\nGenomic testing showed that she had a BRCA1 genetic mutation, increasing her risk for developing breast and ovarian cancer. While her mammogram was negative, she still elected to proactively have her ovaries removed to ensure that she would stay healthy to raise her grandchildren. During surgery, a golf ball sized ovarian cancer tumor was discovered and removed. Because the cancer was caught early, Barnes\u2019 cancer can be successfully treated.\nAs Dr. Ledbetter pointed out, since Barnes\u2019 did not have a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, she never would have suspected that she was at risk for either type of cancer. That\u2019s why this is a perfect example of how pre-emptive genomic testing can improve care."

                            "text": "In the two-room suite of Bart and Geraldine\u2019s office, the first three Teka siblings sat in companionable silence. Bart sat behind the executive desk, Abe on the opposite chair, and Clement perched on the window sill; all three wearing pensive expressions. Although they were not biological brothers, these three reacted quite similarly in perplexing situations\u2014initially, at least. Astonishment\u2026 and then the rest depended on their different temperaments.\nUsing profanity was one of Bart\u2019s vices, especially when things bothered him greatly. Being a dad of four impressionable children meant he had to employ milder terms in expressing his irritation.\nAbe remained silent. Though his slow-to-anger attitude made him the more approachable brother, he bottled too much inside. The only way any of his family members could tell was by the pain in his eyes. Though this time, he kept his head bent, still reeling from the letter he\u2019d found in Eleazar\u2019s room hours ago.\nOut of the three, Clement had been through the horrible foster system and bore deep scars from it. His deeply-rooted bitterness stemmed from being moved from one bad foster home to another, and though it had shaped his life mission as an overseas orphanage chaplain, it had also hardened him. Even though he\u2019d \u201cfound God\u201d through his job, he was still battling demons from the past.\nBart and Clement looked up at the sound of Abe\u2019s voice. He kept his head bent.\n\u201cWeren\u2019t we all like that once?\u201d Abe countered gently.\nAll three brothers grimaced, Clement rubbing his ear absentmindedly.\nThen Abe shrugged off Bart\u2019s hand and reached in his pocket. His brothers curiously eyed the device he pulled out.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Abe asked gently, concern etched in his features.\n\u201cSo it is a tracker,\u201d Clement muttered, shaking his head.\nTheir eyes widened. \u201cWhat for now?\u201d Clement asked, articulating their unease.\nClement muttered an expletive and no one had time to call him out for it. They all remembered the times Phoebe had been rushed to emergency, only to miscarry the babies she\u2019d carried. The thought of Darah facing the same fate, propelled Abe and Clement for the door, almost tripping over each other to exit the office suite.\nBart stalled, watching Geraldine wipe stray tears from her cheeks. He didn\u2019t dare ask what happened, the look in her eyes revealed all and chilled him to the bone.\n\u201cNo, let\u2019s go together,\u201d Bart grabbed her hand instead, knowing Geraldine needed to be there as much as any of them. As far as he was concerned, she and Phoebe had become Darah\u2019s sisters the moment they married into the family.\n\u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s go!\u201d Abe barked from the driver\u2019s seat.\nL.J. stirred awake, the sound of the beeping EKG greeting him in an empty room. He groaned and closed his eyes, groggy but without the searing pain. Thank God. Now if someone could do something about the cumbersome mask around his mouth. He reached for it just as the door swung open.\nHe frowned in disapproval, watching her pour out a cup of coffee. Although it wasn\u2019t his favorite kind, his mouth watered for a taste.\n\u201cI promise I\u2019ll brew you your favorite once we get out of here\u2026\u201d she took a sip and faked a grimace, though a telltale dimple in her right cheek gave her away.\nL.J. sighed forlornly. What a nice girl\u2026 if only J.R. would change his mind. The mention of his son had him scanning the room. He frowned and swung his gaze to Hana enjoying her coffee.\nThe wrinkle between her brow and the conflict in her eyes made the hair on his forearms stand up. L.J. had a sinking feeling he wouldn\u2019t like what she was about to tell him.\nJ.R. couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off her. He gazed at the curtain of thick lashes laid flat, her parched lips parted in sleep, tendrils of dark curly hair laying against her pixyish face. His fingers itched to touch her, to hover over the rounded tip of her nose and feel her breathing. He needed reassuring that she\u2019d be fine, that she wouldn\u2019t suffer like his mother had in her last moments. Cold frisson rushed through him, sending tremors along his back as it had when Phoebe finally called him back with the dreadful news.\nHe drew in a breath and it caught in his throat. He choked on it and immediately felt a hand on his back. Phoebe, the only other person in the room. He\u2019d been allowed entry to the room only because the staff believed he was her fianc\u00e9. J.R. closed his eyes tight, scolding himself. He should\u2019ve proposed sooner and made her happy with his love. Why did he waste so much time until it was too late.\nHe just stared at Darah\u2019s peaceful face. For now, she could rest in peace but the blood-chilling fear when Phoebe first informed him of Darah\u2019s condition made him shiver once more. He could\u2019ve lost them both. The thought made his eyes water. His foolish reaction of Darah\u2019s first child not being his and his begrudging the baby\u2019s father for causing a lifetime of drama had caused this fiasco. If she\u2019d lost the baby, Darah would\u2019ve been crushed and he wouldn\u2019t be able to forgive himself.\nThe door opened and Darah\u2019s three older brothers stumbled into the room. Phoebe quickly wiped her eyes, but not before Abe saw her. \u201cIt\u2019s about time\u2014\u201d the rest of her words were muffled in Abe\u2019s chest as he pulled her to him and held her tight.\n\u201cIs she alright?\u201d Bart asked, standing by J.R.\u2019s shoulder. He and Clement frowned at Darah\u2019s still form.\n\u201cShe\u2019s asleep,\u201d J.R. answered listlessly, returning his eyes to her. How he wished she would open those pretty eyes of hers and melt away the fear that gripped his heart.\nGuilt pricked J.R., as he recalled the night Darah slept on the stiff-backed sofa in his father\u2019s room.\nClement took the seat Phoebe abandoned for her husband\u2019s arms, and reached for Darah\u2019s hand. Bending his head, he began to pray silently and the family followed suit.\n\u201cOh dear!\u201d Phoebe stepped away from Abe and hurried to Darah\u2019s side, embracing her.\n\u201cIt better not,\u201d Clement muttered, squeezing her hand before releasing it.\nJ.R. swallowed hard as relief swept over him like a rushing wave, stealing his breath and his words. He\u2019d almost lost her, all because of his foolhardiness.\nThe brothers didn\u2019t say a word, didn\u2019t move a step. Phoebe glanced from Darah to J.R. whose gazes were locked with such intensity, and stood to her feet. \u201cSure, we can do that. C\u2019mon, boys.\u201d She patted Clement\u2019s shoulder, hooked an arm under Bart\u2019s and Abe\u2019s, and tugged them towards the door.\nClement quietly stood and followed after them, closing the door behind him.\nHer gently-spoken words unlocked something in him and he reached for her hand, cradling it between his. \u201cAnything.\u201d In fact, he was willing to die for her if the need presented itself\u2013his love for her was that strong, that overwhelming.\nThese words pierced him like a sharp dagger. His jaw slackened and he gaped at her. What on earth was she saying?\nDazed, Darah shook her head.\n\u201cYou\u2019re certainly are an odd one.\u201d L.J. coughed and drew in a raspy breath, his brow furrowed in pain.\nDarah drew a hand over her mouth like a zipper. Relief loosened her shoulders when his lips twitched a smile. Maybe J.R.\u2019s father could be charmed after all.\nDarah hurried to his side and ignoring the weight of his suspicious stare on her face, she fluffed his pillow before returning it behind his head.\nDarah nodded, knowing the gist of it all.\nHer shoulders tensed under his probing stare and she tightened her clasped hands.\n\u201cI guess I\u2019d forgotten life can be unjust at time\u2014\u201d L.J. drew in an uneven breath that caught in his throat. His brows furrowed and alarm flitted in his features as he choked on the breath. The sound of the cough that left his mouth was violent and harsh, the sheer pain of it deepened the lines in his brow. He gasped for air, hand moving to his throat.\nFrightened, Darah jumped to her feet. \u201cI-I\u2019ll get the nurse.\u201d She hurried out the door before he could stop her, not that she noticed as she barreled down the hallway.\nThe woman\u2019s amusement fled as her eyes drifted over Darah\u2019s head. She brushed past Darah toward the room, and Darah didn\u2019t follow, hurrying around the corner in search of J.R. and Hana.\n\u201cWhat will he say once he finds out?\u201d Hana stifled Darah\u2019s words.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d J.R. answered in a strained voice. He was clearly exhausted.\nDarah\u2019s stomach turned violently and she shifted from view when Hana turned her head to glare at J.R.\nCuriosity of J.R.\u2019s thoughts temporarily outweighed Darah\u2019s urgency to inform him of his father. So she stalled, waiting and dreading his response.\nDarah\u2019s brow furrowed. What didn\u2019t he know?\nJ.R. was silent a little too long and Darah bit the inside of her cheek a little too hard, drawing blood. Her pulse thumped violently in her throat as she stared at his back and broad shoulders.\nDarah glared at Hana. The woman was meddling more now than before she knew Darah\u2019s little secret.\nDarah frowned at the back of J.R.\u2019s head.\nWith each second J.R. remained silent, Darah grew more troubled. Blood pooled in her mouth as she gnawed the inside of her cheek, eyes stinging with tears that threatened to spill, her stomach in gnarled knots. His hesitance condemned her for putting him in such an awful predicament; having to tell his dying father that the woman he\u2019d chosen was having another man\u2019s baby. She could imagine the horror and disappointment in L.J.\u2019s eyes, and the hurt and shame in J.R.\u2019s.\nDarah took a step back, losing courage to announce herself. She was the bad guy in the story\u2014the villain dashing L.J.\u2019s dreams of beholding his grandchildren and seeing his bloodline through his only son. And every time J.R. would gaze at her son, he\u2019d feel cheated and resentful. The thought of J.R. resenting her hurt more than the pesky ache in her stomach.\nTaking another step back, Darah decided against revealing herself to the couple. They didn\u2019t need to know she\u2019d come for them, and Nurse Karen was more than capable of stabilizing J.R.\u2019s father.\nSuddenly Clement opened the door leading to the garden and stepped inside, greeting the couple with a smile. When he spotted Darah standing by the column, he started to call out to her.\nPutting one finger to her mouth, she shook her head adamantly, pleading with him not to call her out.\nNoticing Clement\u2019s furrowed brow, J.R. turned in the direction of his gaze.\nDarah ducked behind the column, heart pounding violently in her chest. If he knew she\u2019d been standing there and overheard their conversation, he\u2019d feel even more shame. She didn\u2019t want that for him.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d J.R. inquired gently.\nDarah released the breath she didn\u2019t know she\u2019d been holding, and a solid tear slid down her cheek.\n\u201cWhat are you still doing out here? Thought you\u2019d be heading back.\u201d Clement asked.\nWiping the tears with the back of her hand, Darah slunk away before Clement\u2019s could respond. She\u2019d make her decision now. J.R. didn\u2019t deserve to bear the shame and pain of what she\u2019d done.\nDeciding to keep his opinion about that decision unspoken, J.R. simply nodded.\nHis frown only deepened as she confirmed his concern for Darah. He tamped a weary sigh. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right, Doc. I better get my pregnant sister home then.\u201d Cutting J.R. a withering glance, Clement brushed past them to go after Darah.\nThe three found Darah standing outside the door to L.J.\u2019s room. Clement scowled as Darah kept her head bent, hiding her face. No doubt she was crying.\nAt the panic in Hana\u2019s voice, he looked up and spotting the somber expressions awaiting him inside, he released Darah\u2019s shoulders.\nThis time, Darah let out a whimper and leaned her forehead against his chest. Clement swallowed a sigh and wrapped his arms around her.\nJ.R. nodded listlessly and lowered to the chair beside his father\u2019s bed, staring at his mask-covered face. Just when he thought his father was getting better, bad news re-surfaced. He dragged a hand over his face and let out a weary sigh.\n\u201cThank you for catching it on time,\u201d Hana said, her hand still resting on J.R.\u2019s shoulder.\nJ.R. looked up, surmising why Darah trembled in his arms. He was instantly reminded by the Teka siblings\u2019 deeply-rooted aversion to hospitals. Just like him, they\u2019d had their fair share of traumatic events and didn\u2019t need another to remind them of their painful past. Maybe it was best for Darah to return with Clement than staying here with him. As much as he needed her now, she was better off at home with her family. Resolved, he turned to Hana.\nHe sighed as Hana stepped out, then arched a brow when she returned with a frown on her face.\nWithout another word, Clement disconnected the call and J.R. lowered the phone to his thigh. Part of him was relieved, part of him disappointed with the news. Deciding to worry about Darah later, he shook out of it to ask Nurse Karen the next steps in his father\u2019s recovery.\nIn the passenger\u2019s seat, Darah had her face to the window and kept silent.\nUnfortunately, his words offering no balm to Darah\u2019s aching heart. The decision that awaited her would be the hardest one she would have to make, probably harder than her decision to keep the baby. More than anything, she dreaded and resented the resolution altogether.\nDarah closed her eyes tightly shut, pushing one last tear down her cheek."

                            "text": "This is the tale of a photograph taken in 1966. It\u2019s seemingly an ordinary photograph, but it is in fact extraordinary. It is the catalyst for bringing a family spanning generations and continents back together over 50 years later, when almost 100 years of memory and moments will again become distilled in a moment in time, captured by newer technology, yet essentially the same.\nStanding in this photograph, smiling back at you is a family all born from the five children of Manuel (Mendy) and Sophie Amdur, who immigrated to South Africa from England in 1947. It is an old photograph from yesteryear, depicting the Amdur family in all its glory. Left today are sisters Esther (92), Lily (89), and Rita (82). Their sister, Anne, and their brother, Albert, are sadly no longer alive, and with Albert, the family name Amdur died too \u2013 as he had three daughters and no sons. But, the Amdur legacy depicted in this original photo lives on despite name changes and oceans separating them, and they will reunite to catch up on each other\u2019s lives at a family reunion, but one with a difference.\nThe idea for this reunion came from Brenda Mitchel, the daughter of Anne who lives in Australia, when she was visiting her cousin Steve Katznelson, Rita\u2019s son, in the United States. They were looking at family photos, reminiscing about the \u2018good old days\u2019, when they came across a photograph of the entire family (bar one cousin, who had not yet been born). This photo was taken on a Sunday morning. The whole Amdur family had come together in 1966 from Canada, Rhodesia, and Johannesburg to take part in Lily Mark\u2019s son Heath\u2019s bar mitzvah (the brother of Sheena Wolovitz, who is the South African arm of the reunion).\n\u201cToday, there are family members living in Australia, Israel, England, and America,\u201d says Lily. \u201cOur older nephews and nieces were either born here in South Africa or in Zimbabwe, in what was then called Rhodesia.\u201d \u201cThe emigration of so many of our family members over the years has always saddened me. Because of distances, so many milestones are missed and so many shared experiences lost. Modern technology makes distance so much easier and more bearable. With the advent of email and Skype, and, more recently, the incredible Whatsapp, distance virtually melts away,\u201d says Sheena. But, continual effort is required to keep up the relationships, and, even then, it isn\u2019t always easy despite the easy access. Over the last 50 years, some of the cousins have never even met. \u201cWith Scott and me being the sole North Americans among the global scattered group, the interludes with those cousins I have met have been far too infrequent and brief. Still, I feel a tremendous family bond that ties us all together, likely due to the closeness that our Amdur parents shared throughout their lives,\u201d says Steve.\nLily recalls how different it had been for them as children. \u201cOur mother had two brothers in America, and she could only write to them using snail mail, letters written mainly in Yiddish that would take weeks to arrive. Because of the distance separating us, we never met their families.\u201d Rita, however, because she lives in America, is now in touch with some of these American cousins, and Lily has had some contact via email.\n\u201cThe reunion was important for so many reasons, mainly because family is important. There were some spouses and children present who had never met before. Some cousins had not seen each other for more than 50 years and have previously had very little contact with each other. And, everyone would have the chance to connect, and reconnect. There is an indisputable and unbreakable connection between family, no matter what happens over time and place. Family members are a support for each other and a means of sharing responsibilities. Family members share a heritage, a history, a culture, experiences, and often a similar humour. They should share in each other\u2019s simchas, joy, as well as being supports for the difficult times in life,\u201d says Sheena.\n\u201cThis reunion brings us back \u2018home\u2019 for such a long overdue special gathering; what a great opportunity to unite, share stories, introduce our nuclear families to the clan, and create new memories \u2013 it will remain in Amdur lore for generations to come,\u201d says Steve. \u201cFamily is a value instilled in us all by our parents as they were very close, and I too have great memories of my cousins throughout the years. It\u2019s a value I wish to pass on to my children,\u201d says Brenda.\nThe Amdur family reunion will involve four events. The first to take place on the Thursday evening, when everyone has arrived, a relaxed meet and greet dinner at Sheena\u2019s home in Glenhazel, followed by a traditional Friday night Shabbos dinner and a relaxed get-together on Saturday night. The fourth will be the raison de\u2019\u00eatre: a brunch at Sheena which would culminate with\u2026 THE FAMILY PHOTO. Everyone envisioned the day with excitement and energy, the joy of recognising and acknowledging a shared heritage, as well as commitments to closer contact and more communication in the future. It would be another footprint in time, spanning the decades between the Amdurs of the past, the ones in the original photo, the family members who made it to the reunion, and those who might recreate it again in a photo from the future, sometime down the line when the Amdur family meet again. Until then, it\u2019s email and Whatsapp, with a face and a friend to put to a name, and a living memory of what has become the Amdur legacy to which these people all belong."

The two families have 5 children between them, all 11 and younger.\nThe two men, both dedicated outdoors men were friends. They worked together, shared similar passions and lived their lives with enormous intensity and capacity for joy. They died 3 weeks apart, separately, in two completely unrelated tragedies.\nLast night on my flight home from a visit to the big city I brushed up close to that pain. I sat with the sister in law of the most recently lost husband, father, friend, Daddy. Her heart was in pieces, visibly. She was lovely. She was so sad, so worried for her sister, her little niece and the shell shocked boys. Their father died trying to save them from a river; them and the son of the woman sitting next to me for 3 hours. I felt\u2026still feel, gutted. I am grateful that I was there, able to help her with her own young daughter, be a new face, a new ear, a new mirror to look in to see who she is now. As she told me the story, my heart broke again and again. At one point, she said, there were six people in the river, all drowning. Half were there to save, half were being saved. All were at risk of being lost. Too few safety measures afforded by the resort they were visiting, so many people, so much crying and fear and screaming, so little anyone could do. And so, one Daddy died. One husband is gone. So many lives are forever changed.\nI wasn\u2019t there. I don\u2019t know the family personally, though I feel so connected to them. I felt that connection even before meeting this woman who has so much to try and block from her memory, so much to move forward from. I felt that connection because I am a wife, I am a mother. I feel that connection so much more now, having had the little girl with the saddest face I\u2019ve ever seen sit on me, play with my phone and take sad photos of herself. This little girl has just lost her Daddy; she is 3.\nThe two families, linked by friendship and interest and passion and love of the outdoors are now linked by sorrow, loss and tragedy. I am now, forever, linked to their story. I will never erase from my heart the sight of this woman, this heartbroken sister, the aunt of these children in shock. She almost lost her own son and father to the river, lost instead her brother in law, her sister\u2019s joy and her own sense of security in the world.\nShe said it was so awful. So horrible. So unbelievable. She has touched my life forever.\nYukon, we have two families who need us terribly right now. 5 children who will need all the support we can provide. Two mothers whose worlds have just been turned upside down, and who haven\u2019t even begun to measure what lies ahead. I want to do something. I wish I could do something."

Louise been a regular service user of Novas.\n\u201cOur donation made in memory of Louise and all who have perished on our streets will be applied to the intensive family support unit, which currently deals with some 110 families in Limerick alone. Many of Novas\u2019 services rely wholly on charitable donations. Their resources will come under increasing pressure in the run up to Christmas,\u201d said Ms Power.\nUna Burns, head of policy and communications with Novas Limerick, thanked the solicitors for their \u201chugely generous donation\u201d of \u20ac2,000.\n\u201cThis is the second time they have donated to Novas services so we very much appreciate that continued support. Their donation is going directly to our intensive family support service in the city. That works at about 110 families at any one time \u2013 it is particularly important at this time of the year. Donations like this enable us to support them around Christmas,\u201d said Ms Burns. The unit helps families who are either homeless or at a risk of homelessness.\n\u201cWe try to do prevention work to keep families in their home and to support families that are already homeless \u2013 those that are living in B&B accommodation, sofa surfing or living in over crowded accommodation. We try to support them in terms of access to accommodation, budgeting, paying bills, accessing schools for their children especially if they have to travel long distances to school,\u201d said Ms Burns.\nIn 2016, Novas worked with 196 families.\n\u201cThat was an increase of a 100% from 2015. We don\u2019t have full figures for 2017 yet but we are definitely talking of another rise again,\u201d she said. Novas also runs a toy appeal every Christmas.\n\u201cLast year, we supported over 700 children through the toy appeal. We provided gifts at Christmas time for children that their parents might not be able to guarantee. That was all through public donations of new toys and we are immensely grateful,\u201d said Ms Burns. Toys can be dropped into Novas on 1 Mungret Street or email toyappeal@novas.ie for more."

                            "text": "Thank you for making it possible for me, at the age of 32 and only a few months before entering a Psychiatry internship, to begin understanding myself. Although I am now a medical doctor, I have suffered all my life from depression, anxiety and a deep feeling of isolation. As I now begin to realize how terrible my childhood experience was, and at the same time reading your books and articles, I find myself again in isolation. This is because your focus is on the cruelty directly inflicted by parents on their children. My story is a little different.\nThe basic situation I have known as a child was that of incessant mental and physical humiliation and a fear I might be killed at any moment. This has made me so insecure, that I am still very often flooded with intense fear of strangers as I walk down an innocent street. But the direct physical threat of being killed did not come from my parents. Rather, it came from my sister, 5 years older than me, and especially from my brother, 8 years older than me. My brother has treated both me and my sister sadistically, as a response to the mental cruelty which we all suffered from my mother. The problem with my parents, even worse in my view than their mental cruelty, was that they never protected me. They supposedly didn\u2019t know \u2013 or didn\u2019t care to know \u2013 that in the hands of my brother and sister I was subject to torture on a regular basis. My sister was repeatedly complaining about my brother\u2019s violence, but my parents ignored her. From this I learned at an early age that it was pointless to tell. Twice I told my parents about incidents of humiliation as a child, and twice they laughed in my face. For years I myself was laughing as I was talking about these events.\nI have suffered from all forms of abuse: mental, physical, and sexual. I now realize that the mental abuse I suffered from my parents was more severe and harmful than I thought. And yet, the constant fear I was going to be killed by my siblings seems to me the most damaging of all. My tormentors were children. thus, I cannot blame them for being so full of rage. My parents\u2019 duty was to protect an 8-year-old child from being abused by a 16-year-old sadistic sibling. This they haven\u2019t done. And although I did not suffer physical abuse as \u201ccorporal punishment\u201d from my parents, I did suffer, and am still suffering, the effects of severe physical abuse. This kind of abuse in the family, in which the parents\u2019 cruelty is INDIRECTLY inflicted upon a younger child through the rage of an older sibling, I did not find mentioned in your writings so far \u2013 although I must admit that I haven\u2019t yet read ALL of your works, and I apologize if my plea reflects my ignorance.\nA.M.: Your siblings did to you what they learned from your parents whom you still protect because you are so afraid of them. My last article on this site may be helpful. But saying this I don\u2019t want to minimize your suffering that you endured from your sister and brother. It must have been terrible. Your rage, however, seems to be more free when you talk on them. It is only totally blocked when you think on your parents who still can laugh at you, when you try to complain."

                            "text": "Director Tammi Sutton (Killjoy 2: Deliverance from Evil (2002)) brings forth a story involving a haunted house, shot in Chulmleigh Village, UK, though not quite a horror tale as it incorporates dark dramatic sequences. Herein again Tammi takes the bold initiative to create a new angle within the genre, setting storyline plagued with tragic consequences and running them into supernatural elements. This all occurs in Whispers a movie that needs your attention for the entire 90-minutes, no dosing off and stay off the phone for this flick released from MTI Home Video. Before one tries to dismiss the film because of the non-traditional horror approach, understand the genre itself often crossovers between suspense and drama, these aspects help create tension and set the tone, but the viewer needs to understand that a few clich\u00e9s do occur but the story stands well itself.\nYoung Catherine Caldwell\u2019s (Lilja Johnson) childhood plagued hideous problems leaving her with so many emotional scars, which could challenge Dr. Phil, she witnesses much turmoil and heartache along with apparition torment. The movie transitions to present day with Catherine (Keeley Hazell) and her husband Harvey (Craig Rees) trying regain their love for each other after the death of their daughter Lilly (Leyla Gellan) died. A series of flashbacks show insights to their lives and how they deal with marriage counseling with the intent to retreat and recoup but the paranormal encounter doesn\u2019t like their plans. Meanwhile, Hazell portrays a grieving mother full of emotional conflicts grasping at the final straw of reality, while Rees might be perceived as standoffish, more likely unsure of what to do, how to mourn and yet stay strong and positive for his wife. Sutton who penned the script gives the two primary actors a positive foundation to build from, and conveys to the audience the pain and suffering of losing one\u2019s child, a tough and likely inconceivable an action no parent wants to visit upon them or truly anyone. The ghostly apparition also plays more than the standard bump in the night, or exaggerated manifestation of itself, rather appearing in surfaces that can cast a reflection to objects moving. All of it adding to suspenseful moments and tight tension, a dark winding path for characters and viewers to equal travel as well as learning secrets to a mystery awaiting the proper reveal. Then subtle pain inflicted emotionally perhaps spiritual by a charming and bit cunning Sasha (Barbara Nedeljakova) and Simon (Phil Bloomberg) to Catherine sends unnerving chills, some anger, and more grief. One must look for three horror cameos from Actress Lynn Lowry as Elizabeth Connelly, a very emotionally withdrawn woman, along with Elissa Dowling as The Doll and Elieen Dietz, whom many recall as a demon in The Exorcist (1973) stars only in the trailer, her main scenes sadly cut from the film. \u2018Whispers\u2019 itself generates a solid finale, bundling all of the anguish, spiritual scars and emotional pain laced over a supernatural tale.\nAs with many low budget films, the cracks show through a little bit, but Sutton works with some very good camerawork, to overlap these issues concerning the sound. The sound suffers tremendously and tests the audience patience, in the first act, and seems smoother through the rest of the movie as well as the CGI; it feels disjointed never quite blending throughout the movie. If you saw the film entitled Conjurer (2008) from director Clint Hutchison one might notice similar story links of a couple moving to the countryside for an escape of the child\u2019s death, however it this storyline often used in horror movies, but this time executed fairly well.\nThe average horror fans should take the time to investigate the haunted tension tales in Whispers, noting not the typical jump scare story, as the suspense ratchets up the movie to a refreshing pace."

                            "text": "In a long room with a high arched ceiling a venerable looking old man was seated behind a tall desk at one end of the room. His kind face was partially covered by a long white beard, and he was clad in a robe of white with gold trimmings and there seemed to be an aura of light radiating from his head. On his right were two rows of chairs on which were seated twelve men, also in white and gold robes and a white light seemed to be radiating from them as though the room were being lighted by some indirect method. On his left was standing a row of people, like people in a bread line, all kinds of people. Most of them were men, young men, dressed in ragged clothing which resembled military uniforms.\nAt the rear of the room there were two doors. Through the door at the right one could see a stairway which seemed to lead to an upstairs room. The room above seemed to be well lighted and if one listened closele he could here soft music coming as it seemed from somewhere above. The door on the left also opened to a stairway but this stairway went down and at the bottom was an open door leading into a room from which no light came.\nImmediately to the right and in front of the ancient judge was a seat. The people in the line were taking their turns at this seat. After a few questions were asked by the old man and replys given by the person in the seat, a consultation would take place among the men clothed in gold and white robes. Then the old man would indicate one of the doors at the rear of the room and the person in the seat would enter the door which was indicated to him. The venerable old man seldom made any mistakes. Occasionally when he would indicate one of the doors for the person seated before him, there would be a rumbling like the sound of thunder overhead, whereupon the discussion would be resumed at the end of which the old man would indicate the other door.\nThe first person standing in the row of people wearing a military uniform was a youth of about twenty-four. When it came his time to take the seat before the old man he answered to the name of John Miller. The young man had a bewildered look upon his face. He was thinking of a wife and child back in Devonshire. He was wondering where he was and why he was there and if there was anyway he could send word back to her. The last thing he could remember before entering this room was a battle scene in the mountains of Greece which seemed to have concluded by a terrible explosion. The whiskered gentleman spoke to John in a very reassuring tone of voice, telling him there was nothing to fear. Immediatly, John's mind seemed to clear and the look of bewilderment left his face. In fact he felt brighter than he ever had any other day of his life. His entire life seemed to be a panorama before his mind. Every detail seemed to be right there before him. He suddenly realized where he was and why he was there. Looking directly into the eyes of the young soldier the old man asked, \"Is everything clear in your mind, John Miller?\" John nodded his assent. \"You are aware, John, that before you came here you were responsible for the taking of the lives of several other young men there in the battlefields of Greece.\"\n\"Where are they?\" John exclaimed, \"Please let me talk to them; I didn't realise what I was doing.\" The look in the judge's eye assured John that his pleas would not be answered. It was too late for that.\n\"Why did you kill those men, John?\"\n\"But, sir,\" replied John, \"it was not to my liking to commit such bloody acts, but what is a fellow to do? I had my orders to kill, and no man can keep his self-respect if he does not obey the orders of his superiors. If what I have done is wrong, that may be as it is, but surely no righteous God could judge a man as sinful who is doing only what he thinks is right.\"\nThe old man said nothing. The men seated on the right began talking among themselves, some nodding one way and some the other. Finally they seemed to agree and the ancient judge indicated with his left hand the door which led into the darkened stairway.\nAs he walked the length of the room, John was wondering if he would ever see his wife and child again. His own fate seemed unimportant to him; his only regret was that he would not be able to help his bereaved family. As he approached the door he hesitated momentarily. He thought he heard a noise. He stopped and listened again. He was sure this time.\nDistinctly he could hear the roll of thunder.\nThis story was written 21 months before the attack on Pearl Harbor and the entrance of the U.S. into World War 2. However Britain and France were already at war with Germany and it was only a matter of time before we were involved. This story was written by my father who entered the war in 1942 as part of General Patton's third army. He landed on Utah beach in Normandy, France on August 6, 1944, 60 days after D-Day. The war took him through France, Belgium, Luxembourg and into Germany right to Hitler's \"Berghof\" in Bavaria after the war ended."

While many of the problems we were tasked to complete were par for the escape room course, we never found ourselves reduced to 'just' rummaging around for a key or lock combination. Everything is highly automated, and the room includes several engaging, novel exercises that really round out the experience.\nThe first leg of the experience includes a number of puzzles that must be solved separately to reunite your scattered crew before advancing to further content. While breaking the party up can often leave a gimmicky aftertaste, the mechanic was executed impeccably in the context of Lunar Mission's narrative. However, this can also significantly slow down the group and break up a party's rhythm if one group gets stuck and others are left twiddling their proverbial (or literal) thumbs waiting for the narrative to advance.\nA lot of effort seemed to have gone into the set. Everything in the room looked like it belonged and jived with the theme. While loath to use the term 'realistic' to describe an experience roughly on par with the set design of one's local laser tag arena, I can confidently say the set design was on the high end of the escape room spectrum.\nWhile traversing a crawl-space section of the experience, the word 'zombies' was muttered, as a joke, by one of our party\u2014panic and hilarity ensued. Crawl spaces are always great!\nThe final moments also proved quite exciting. After seeing many otherwise great escape room experiences hampered by lackluster endings, it was great to see this one close out with a roar.\nLunar Mission definitely had its highs and lows. While it was thematically one of my favorite rooms of our LA experience, it had a rocky start with a mix of eardrum-shattering ambient sound and poor-quality radio equipment. The room also features a few puzzles that seemed irrelevant to the ultimate objective, but I'm willing to chalk that impression up to a happy mix of luck and obliviousness on the part of our brave lunar astronauts.\nEveryone seemed to enjoy themselves. Lunar Mission did turn out to be somewhat overshadowed by the overwhelmingly good time had by all afterward in the \"Magic Kingdom\" room at the same Maze location, but \"Lunar Mission\" nonetheless proved a memorable, highly recommendable experience.\nThe room is billed as being for 2-5 players, but 3 seemed to be the sweet spot for a group of mixed experience levels.

Although this expert never revealed himself, everyone knew just how terrifying he was. He was able to stop the skeleton that possessed strength beyond Saint Emperor from afar without even appearing.\nThe skeleton was extremely angry. The dense Baleful Yin Force around it violently churned, surging out time and time again. However, it was forced back by a blade of light that even the skeleton itself could not block. More and more cracks appeared on its body and a few bones were even broken.\nA few resplendent blades of light swept past and forced the surrounding Yin Qi and grudges of the dead to the sides. Slivers of domineering and terrifying blade Qi remained there, actually causing the path paved between the vile energies to remain temporarily.\nMany people moved at this moment. Many Saint Kings had already begun traveling in the direction the blades of light originated from, wanting to see just who the mysterious expert was.\nTheir movement immediately spurred on everyone else present. They immediately shot off in the same direction with lightning speed. The ident.i.ty of this mysterious expert weighed on many people\u2019s minds.\nJian Chen and the others were not exceptions either. They all followed the group in the direction of the blades of light.\nThey pa.s.sed through the second zone with lightning-like speed and arrived in the first. As soon as they made it there, everyone immediately jumped. A suffocatingly powerful blade Qi filled the entire s.p.a.ce. The blade Qi seemed to have infected the air, making the air there feel sharp.\nA blinding white light stood over ten kilometers in front of them. It was as dazzling as the sun, illuminating the entire first zone of the Death Nest.\nIt was endless amounts of blade Qi. The white light was completely formed from mighty blade Qi and looking closely, it was not difficult to discover that the light seemed like a huge blade. It was a hundred meters tall.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a balde\u2026\u201d Someone murmured in amazement. In that moment, everyone focused their attention on the blade. It was just a pity that the blade was covered by blade Qi, so it was blurry and unclear.\nThe great elders of the Tyrant\u2019s Blade School stared at the blade\u2019s figure without blinking at all. A gleam of light flashed through their eyes as doubt and surprise crossed their faces.\nAt this moment, the blade Qi that filled the entire first zone quickly weakened. The white light also quickly darkened, and in just a few seconds, the figure of the giant blade suddenly disappeared. It returned peace to the Death Nest.\nA few Saint Kings immediately began making guesses. Some people believed that there was a great person secretly behind the blade while others were certain it came from a formation, something Mo Tianyun had set up all those years ago.\nThe ground began to shake. The blood-red skeleton had pa.s.sed through the formation and was pursuing them. The blood-red mist around it surged into the sky and the Baleful Yin Force it radiated was even denser than before.\nThe Saint Kings no longer dared to stay any longer now that the blade had disappeared. They left as quickly as they could.\nAs soon as Jian Chen\u2019s group flew out of the Death Nest, Rui Jin began constructing a s.p.a.ce Gate.\nHowever, as soon as it formed, several terrifying attacks flew in from all directions, shattering the gate.\n\u201cHand over the Saints\u2019 Fruit, or you won\u2019t be leaving here,\u201d a great elder from a protector clan called out. His presence quickly skyrocketed. He seemed like a whole different person when he fled earlier.\nWithout the threat of the blood-red skeleton, everyone focused their attention of the Saints\u2019 Fruit again. Over two hundred Saint Kings surrounded Jian Chen and the others. The atmosphere became utterly nerve-wracking.\nThe great elders of the Changyang clan stood to one side with ugly expressions. They were extremely worried, but they did not stand up and help Jian Chen.\n\u201cWorld of Feathers!\u201d Suddenly, Hong Lian cried out. The armor on her began to disa.s.semble once more, turning into countless phoenix feathers to form a huge cage around them. Every single feather burned with intense white flames, preventing the Saint Kings from approaching them.\n\u201cIf you want the Saints\u2019 Fruit, then use everything you have!\u201d A Saint King cried out. Many Saint Kings stepped forward and used various Saint Tier Battle Skills and powerful ancient secret techniques to barrage the World of Feathers.\n\u201cThe s.p.a.ce in here is affected by the flames. It\u2019s become very unstable, so creating a s.p.a.ce Gate will be rather difficult. I\u2019ll try my best,\u201d said Rui Jin before swinging his hand. The s.p.a.ce in front of him immediately split open, but the s.p.a.ce Gate did not form as quickly this time.\nRui Jin\u2019s arm was extended in the crack. The profound truths of the world were present on his hand. He was using a Saint King\u2019s ability to create s.p.a.ce Gates.\nOutside the feathers, a hundred-meter-long hand suddenly fell from the sky. With a deafening boom, the hand viciously struck the feathers, causing them all to tremble violently.\nYou're reading novel Chaotic Sword God Chapter 1163: A Mysteries Expert (Two) online at LightNovelFree.com.

                            "text": "Okay, at the end of Defiance, Kain has the Soul Reaver and it is possessed by Raziel. This is at the same time that younger Kain has the Reaver at the pillars. Now, where did old Kain get the sword? Because if it is the one that he pulled out of Raziel in SR2 and he has taken it 500 years into the future, how come the young Kain still found it in Avernus.\nNow, you could say that perhaps after Kain defeats the Elder God he goes back in time and plants the sword in Avernus for the young Kain to find, but if that was the case, Kain would have been united with the pure blade much earlier in history and then would have later destroyed it by whacking Raziel over the head with it, why? This would also mean that Raziel would also have the pure blade at a much earlier stage and that all of the ensuing gameplay would have been complete nonsense.\nWhat's going on? Somebody help!\nwhen you are editing/posting a message, there are a few buttons at the top of your text window.\njust hit the spolier button and voila!\nThere are two swords. but they are the same sword. if you get what i mean. one of them is the now reaver and the other is the then reaver.\nhi, plot man. welcome to the forum.\nif you have played all the games, you will realise that there is time travel involved in these games, so ordinary linear story telling isn't really applicable here.\nboth these events shuffled history about, and in a way changing what will happen in the future.\nthose time altering events never happened before, so that is why everything must be done now.\nif you look at kain's soul reaver at the end of the game, it is all glowing and electrified looking like at the end of defiance.\nOkay, thanks for your help, but this still does not suffice.\nEven if Kain was to put the reaver back so that the young Kain finds it, in the future (SR1) the younger Kain would still have to strike Raziel with the blade in order for Raziel to retrieve it as a wraith blade, so that Raziel could then imbue the blade at the vampire citadel. However, if Raziel was struck by the sword from the end of Defiance, there would be no need for him to go to the forge in the vampire citadel, as the wraith blade would already be imbued! Plus, if it was the case that Kain put the imbued reaver back for the younger Kain, what was the point in Raziel's sacrifice, since the blade only ends up being destroyed anyway?\nI don't know if I'm making my point very clearly here, but hey, that's about it.\nAs for Blood Omen 2, I try to think of that as a completely separate game because it's plot does not fit in at all with the others.\nThis is namely, but not solely, due to the fact that Vorador is still alive.\nAargh! Isn't there anyone who can properly explain this? It is really annoying me!\nWhen Raziel is stabbed by Kain in the end of Defiance, his actual soul (not the wraith blade) is pulled inside the Reaver. His soul itself is not imbued with anything and is required for the Blood Reaver to become the true \"Soul Reaver\" that we see in Blood Omen/Blood Omen 2/Soul Reaver. The physical Soul/Blood Reaver is not purified at any point, since only Raziels body soul is taken, so it is actually never imbued with the spirit of Ariel and the other balance guardians.\nThe imbued \"pure\" wraith blade is used to heal Kain as it is a future version of the \"purified\" soul of Raziel. So in short at the moment, Raziel transfers his souls twice, his body soul into the Reaver, and his wraith blade soul into Kain himself.\nThe imbued \"pure\" wraith blade also purifies Kain so that he can see the EG and uncorrupts him.\nhmm... alright then, that seems to be a reasonable explanation. It all seems feasible, except the bit about Darkwraith. Thanks mucho. I can be at peace on that one."

                            "text": "On paper, both chemical etching and traditional engraving can be described as the process of cutting lines into a hard surface (such as metal).\nHowever, there is one major difference between the two: etching is a chemical process while engraving is a physical process.\nThe former uses an acid solution (etching agent) to etch lines into a surface, often leaving behind intricate and detailed designs. On the other hand, Engraving cuts directly into the surface with the help of sharp tools. Silver is a very popular metal that is used for both these processes! In fact, photo-etching silver is a great way of manufacturing parts that are used in a broad spectrum of industries.\nSo, what are the primary difference between chemical etching and traditional engraving methods? It\u201d\u2122s time to find out the pros and cons of each method and which is right for your needs.\nA tightly-controlled corrosion process, chemical etching produces highly complex material parts. Chemical etching can be used with a range of different metals including silver, stainless steel, mild steel, copper, brass, aluminium and much more, producing parts accurately and economically. Compared to traditional engraving, chemical etching is a more cost-effective and ideal for those businesses with tight deadlines.\nThe cost of complex chemically designs is no different from the cost of simple designs, as the process remains the same whatever your needs. All metal sheets are subject to the same scrutiny and acid wash processing, maintaining a high level of accuracy at all times across the full sheet design.\nDuring processing, the properties of chemically etched metal sheets remain unaffected entirely thanks to the photo-resist mask that we use when applying design templates. The process is gentle and effective, leaving your original material both burr and stress free compared to other metal work processes such as punching or stamping.\nYou can perform design iterations quickly and economically with chemical etching because designs are confirmed digitally and applied using a vacuum, removing room for errors. The entire process is relatively fast, and as numerous amounts of designs can be manufactured from one sheet, it is also economical, too.\nThe range of metals that are compatible with this process is vast. This is arguably the biggest benefit of chemical etching as a process!\nTraditional engraving involves the use of sharp tools to draw designs directly onto silverware or other raw materials \u2013 this is often for parts and components, as well as guns, jewellery, and other decorative items. For example, designs and writing on metal ornaments and jewellery is often engraved or signage. These days this can be done by hand or using a laser.\nThis method requires significant strength and skill to etch lines into metal sheets and parts, which can often incur additional cost and time to each order. That being said, the results are well executed and this method is very popular in certain industries, especially retail and e-commerce.\nWhether you are looking to work with silver, gold, stainless steel, aluminium, brass, copper or any of our extensive metal material range, you are in the right place.

                            "text": "Thanks to Patrice Lewis at Rural Revolution for this description of her family\u2019s tire garden. Great pictures included!\nWe\u2019ve lived in north Idaho for nearly nine years now, and it\u2019s worth noting that we\u2019ve never had a successful garden. One year we had a pretty good one, but I wouldn\u2019t classify it as great. And that was just one year.\nGardening in our area is tough. If it\u2019s not the heavy clay soil, it\u2019s the boggy spring conditions, the weeds, the short growing season, the deer, the voles, or even the grasshoppers. In short, the odds are against us.\nIt\u2019s not that we haven\u2019t tried. We\u2019ve plowed endless amounts of composted manure into the soil in an effort to improve it. It hardly made a difference since we were still competing with the other issues (boggy spring rains, deer, etc.).\nLast year we finally gave in and made four raised beds for our small fruits (raspberries, blueberries, strawberries), which makes perfect sense. Raised beds mean the soil drains better, warms up sooner in the season, and the beds can be netted against deer as well as meshed on the bottom against voles. In short, raised beds seemed like the perfect solution. With materials we had on hand, we made those four beds for the small fruits, and what a difference it\u2019s made!\nBut we were stymied with repeating this process for vegetables, because we\u2019d need lots more raised beds. As in, lots and lots and lots, in order to grow enough veggies to keep us reasonably self-sufficient in produce. The problem wasn\u2019t space \u2014 we\u2019re blessed with plenty of that. The problem was materials to build the beds (and a lack of money to spend on said materials).\nWe are fortunate to have a decent stockpile of boards and beams from an old barn we disassembled many years ago \u2014 but even that supply of wood was limited and we didn\u2019t want to use it ALL on raised beds for the garden because it would leave us without wood for other projects.\nSo one day about a month ago \u2014 God alone knows why it took us so long to reach such an obvious conclusion \u2014 we decided to try tire gardening. It was one of those head-clunk \u201cduh!\u201d why-didn\u2019t-we-think-of-that-sooner moments.\nThe more we thought about it, the better an idea it seemed. Tires are tough to the point of indestructible, they\u2019re free, they\u2019re black (the better for absorbing sunlight and warming the soil earlier in the season), and they\u2019re abundant.\nAnd my goodness, they\u2019re everywhere! We started asking around gas stations and auto repair places and other potential sources, then nearly staggered back as the owners practically shoveled all their old tires in our direction. We also have a friend named Jack who works at Les Schwab (a regional chain of tire centers), and about once a week he loads about thirty old tires onto the back of his truck and delivers it to our place, and we compensate him for his time and gas. We\u2019ve paced off our garden spaces, and potentially we have room for about 550 tires! (Obviously it will take awhile to work up to that.) There\u2019s a lot of garden space inside that many tires.\nWe learned a thing or two, especially from Jack. Don\u2019t get steel-belted radials, he told us, because the steel extends into the sidewalls and we wouldn\u2019t be able to cut through it. We also learned that, aside from the occasional giganto tractor tire (what a treasure!), tires can be roughly divvied up into three sizes: small, medium, and large.\n\u201cLike cutting butter,\u201d Don said.\nWe\u2019ll have to figure out some function for the cut-out sidewall pieces.\nMeanwhile we started putting out word with friends that we\u2019re on the lookout for old tires. Our neighbor told us he had an old tractor tire down in his woods that his grandkids used to use as a fort. We were welcome to take it.\nTires like this are a bonus. Here in farming country it won\u2019t be hard to find them \u2014 we just have to put out the word.\nBut tractor tires, being so big, are harder to fill. While we\u2019ll welcome a few such tires, the smaller ones are easier to handle. In fact, we used the tractor to fill the tractor tire, layering soil and lots of composted manure.\nSo before we lay down a tire, we\u2019re putting down a thick layer of newspapers, then anchoring them with mesh hardware cloth. Here Don\u2019s cutting the hardware cloth.\nThe hardware cloth (which we bought last year) comes in three-foot-wide rolls. We need strips two feet wide to go under the regular (not tractor) tires. The long strip of one-foot-wide wire we cut up and lay two pieces together. Can\u2019t waste this stuff, it\u2019s too expensive.\nNewspapers. Lots and lots of newspapers. I estimate I\u2019ll be going through stacks twelve or fifteen feet high. I\u2019m soliciting newspapers from all our friends.\nI\u2019m trying to lay everything out as tidy and neat as possible, since the location of the tires (once filled) will be more or less permanent. (And, not incidentally, since I\u2019m hoping to write some future magazine articles on this project, it doesn\u2019t hurt to have the end result as photogenic as possible.) Don also plans to run drip irrigation hoses among the rows of tires, so keeping everything in nice rows will help with that aspect.\nThe only thing I\u2019ve planted so far is potatoes (which I\u2019ll write as a separate blog post) since we\u2019re still in the process of acquiring tires, cutting up tires, laying out tires, etc. Our warm weather is holding (unusual) so we may take chances and plant some of the cool-loving plants soon, such as broccoli and peas.\nIt would be far too expensive to keep ordering topsoil (we bought a load last year for the berry beds), so we\u2019re going to use our own stuff heavily amended with composted manure, and see what happens.\nThis is an unfolding project and I\u2019ll be documenting it as I go. But I\u2019m so excited about its potential! I\u2019m babbling about it to anyone who will listen. Maybe I\u2019m just setting myself up for failure once more \u2014 God knows it\u2019s happened before \u2014 but at least we\u2019re tipping the odds of a successful garden in our favor this time.\nAnd, as a side bonus, we\u2019ll eventually be keeping about 550 tires and a fifteen-foot stack of newspapers out of the landfill. Whoo-hoo!"

With its regimented symmetry, countless features borrowed from classical architecture and rolling grounds, on first glace Calke Abbey was not dissimilar to the most Stately homes which dot the hills of Derbyshire.\nBut looks can be deceiving, and within the house reveals itself as a magnificent labyrinth of rooms in varying states of decay and disarray. Once you've made your way past the warm open fires and greeting smiles, you can truly begin to appreciate and understand what sets Calke Abbey apart from the usual Stately Home experience. Each layer of history is left tantalizingly exposed, with the different stages in the houses history easily distinguishable. Some rooms remained full of furniture, books and everyday objects, in a state of fading deterioration, others claustrophobically packed with an eclectic array of collections. The dank smell of damp hanging heavy in the air was an ever present part of most rooms, and an occasional cold chill, only enhanced the lonely, eerie neglect of the building. In one room however, the ethic of preservation not restoration, appeared to have been lost. The only room in the house to have been restored felt somewhat uncomfortable and bizarre in comparison to the ruinous, threadbare atmosphere of the rest of the house.\nThe element within Calke Abbey which struck me most, was the bizarre ever present reminder of death and decay, not only in the house itself but also in the vast collections on display. In virtually every room was not only taxidermy but countless skulls, horns and antlers. This unabashed, slightly grotesque display of death sat strangely beside portraits of the great and the good, giving the house an inescapably sinister atmosphere.\nVisiting Calke Abbey provided a wonderfully inspirational insight into the decline and decay of the stately home. A visually exciting and inspiring experience I encourage any creatives, especially those with a slightly morbid constitution to pay Calke Abbey a visit, I doubt you will be disappointed."

                            "text": "Our sense of smell is really quite incredible. Every time we take in a breath or taste food, countless molecules swarm into our nasal passages. As they move up the nasal tract, these visitors arrive at a patch of cells on which there are over 10,000 different kinds of docking stations. These cells are odor receptors, and each of them can register a different odor. Together they make up a chemical detector that is much more sensitive and versatile that anything we can come close to building.\nIn a paper published in the journal PNAS in February, the authors demonstrate through a series of ingenious experiments that smell can be sensitive enough to pick up on tiny differences in atomic vibrations.\nThe conventional theory of smell works somewhat like a lock and a key. The molecules are the key, and they \u2018lock in\u2019 to receptors that fit their exact shape and size. This is the shape theory of smell, and the basic idea had been suggested in the 1st century BCE by the Epicurean philosopher Lucretius. The idea has since garnered substantial evidence with the discovery of odor receptors, leading to the 2004 Nobel Prize in Medicine for working out the overall picture of how smell works.\nAn alternative hypothesis is the vibration theory. This proposes that smell works not by detecting the shape of molecules, but by measuring how the atoms in a molecule are vibrating.\nMolecules are groups of atoms that are held together by chemical bonds. These bonds are somewhat elastic, causing the atoms in the molecules to constantly jiggle about. This is analogous to what would happen if you were to connect balls together with springs (something that physicists love to do). But the analogy breaks down at this microscopic scale, and one needs to resort to the laws of quantum mechanics to understand what is happening. It turns out that, similar to the balls and springs, molecules have certain ways in which they prefer to jiggle. They can stretch, rock, wag and twist around.\nSo, which is it? Does smell work via shape or vibration? The authors set out to address this question with flies.\nThe best way to distinguish the two theories would be to find two chemicals that are identical in shape, but vibrate in different ways. This is exactly what the experimenters did, by taking a molecule, and replacing some of its hydrogen atoms with deuterium. Deuterium is a sort of heavier sibling of hydrogen that behaves very similarly, but is about twice as heavy. And a heavy atom is harder to wiggle - so the molecule and its counterpart will now vibrate at different rates, but their shape and size will remain the same.\nIn their experiments, flies were sent down a T shaped corridor. At the junction, they were presented with different odors from their left and right. If they could not distinguish between the odors, you would expect no more flies going left than right - it would just be based on chance.\nIn the first experiment, the authors presented the flies with acetophenone at one exit. Acetophenone is a colorless sweet smelling liquid with a fairly simple molecular structure. It\u2019s the stuff that\u2019s added to give that cherry or strawberry smell to chewing gum. The other exit just had plain old air. They counted how many flies went through each exit.\nThey the repeated this experiment with the \u2018deuterized\u2019 versions of acetophenone - same shape, different vibrations. If the ability to smell relies only on the shape of the molecule, and not on the vibrations, then one would expect nothing to change.\nInstead, here is what they saw.\nIn figure A, the bars show the percentage of flies that chose that chose one exit over the other. The flies were initially attracted to the acetophenone (ACP). However, as the researchers replaced more and more of the hydrogen atoms with deuterium in this molecule (3, 5 or all 8 hydrogen atoms), they found that the instead of being attracted by the scent, the flies were repelled by it.\nIf the flies were presented with acetophenone at one exit, and its heavier counterpart on the other, they strongly preferred the former scent (first bar in figure B). This implies that they can distinguish between odors whose molecules differ in vibration but are identical in shape! They repeated this experiment with two different chemicals (octanol and benzaldehyde) to ensure the results were robust.\nThe experimenters then systematically went on to rule out alternate explanations for their results.\nFirst, is this just about scent? Could the deuterium be affecting the flies in some other way altogether, one that has nothing to do with odor? To answer this, they repeated the experiment with genetic mutant flies who lacked a crucial part of their odor receptors. These flies couldn\u2019t smell, and neither did they have a preference between acetophenone or it\u2019s heavier counterpart. So, this is all about the smell.\nNow, it could still be possible that perhaps some impurity crept into all the deuterium version. To rule out this explanation, the authors conducted a beautiful set of experiments. The set up is the same as before, acetophenone on one side, and the heavy version on the other. But now, they zapped the flies with an electric shock whenever they made a particular choice - say, for choosing the heavy molecule. In this way, they could condition the flies to reliably prefer either of the two compounds.\nThe flies could apply their lessons from one scent to the other. When zapped on regular ACP, they avoided regular BZA, and went zapped on heavy ACP, they avoided heavy BZA. (The experiments were repeated across 3 pairs of molecules to ensure robustness). Since these chemicals are synthesized in entirely different ways, this means that it\u2019s not the impurities, but that the flies can somehow sniff out the \u2018deuterium-ness\u2019 of a molecule.\nBut this raises another question. Are the flies somehow sniffing out the deuterium, or is it the vibrations? In other words, could the deuterium be causing some subtle non-vibrational change in the chemistry that the flies can detect?\nThey then identified a pair of chemicals that differed in this precise way. It\u2019s like finding two different sets of musical chords, each set differing in just one note. The pair they found had a citrus lemongrass smell, and had no atoms of deuterium. The flies had no preference for either chemical in the pair.\nBased on their theory - that it is the vibrations, not the presence of deuterium, that is being used by the flies to discern smells - the authors made the following prediction. Flies that are trained to differentiate between the deuterium based pair should also distinguish between this new pair of chemicals that have the same difference in vibrations.\nAnd they were right! The preferences the flies had been conditioned with were generalized to this chemically novel setting. So the odor receptors of flies are essentially incorporating a biological version of a spectrograph - an instrument that can tune in to vibrations at different frequencies.\nA working model of this \u2018tuning in\u2019 might work was first proposed in 1996 by Luca Turin, one of the authors of the current paper. His idea relies on a bizarre but well understood feature of the quantum world, where a subatomic particle like an electron can \u2018tunnel\u2019 through a solid barrier. Turin\u2019s theory has remained fairly controversial and is not adopted by the community at large, but his idea has since been checked by physicists and shown to be a consistent, workable model.\nI find this work remarkable for a number of reasons. First, it\u2019s science at it\u2019s best - the authors address a fascinating and fundamental question through clear, cleverly designed and simple to understand experiments. Secondly, if Turin\u2019s model is correct, then it is incredible to imagine that natural selection has driven this system to such extreme precision that it is making use of atomic physics. And finally, this work is a great example of what goes by the awful name of interdisciplinary research. This study would not have been possible had the authors not possessed a thorough understanding of biology, chemistry and physics. Such research bridges the arbitrary distinctions between departments, and focuses on what is truly exciting - nature herself."

Revolution, Declamatory Art and Propaganda, Biological Exuberance, Rururbanity, Flesh Bursting and Decay, Collective Recycling, Dialogue and Confrontation, Archaic Machines, Low Commerce and Traditional Labour configure the cosmography of a city where imagination seems to be overwhelmed by the boldness of its material reality. The photographs here exhibited convey this message to the visitor. To the myth of being the capital of rumba, tobacco and rum, Havana responds with a heavy physical presence, hardened by a vertical sun which doesn\u2019t allow any concealment of the ruin of its urban fabric. The pearl of the Antilles, the city of infinite wealth in the colonial world, is now a rotting paradise that reeks of sweat and debris, made of human physical contact, material recycling and constant wheeling and dealing. Fifty years of economic embargo have faded any heroism into an agonic expression of survival on the outskirts of the hegemony of global modernization. However, as peripheral, Havana seduces by demonstrating its otherness within the global condition. It traps its visitors in an intense tapestry of smell and touch that allows a different vantage point from which to redefine our idea of material expression \u2013from a detached external object to an internalized and commonly shared biological process within the city. By chance or by fate, the decay of the city portrays this kind of Real-Marvelous condition as defined by the Cuban writer Alejo Carpertier. Yet this should not be seen as the sublimated reality romanticized by magical realisms, but the condition by which the biological processes of decay, dejection, and contamination subsume the collective imagination into the experience of everyday life, and the construction-destruction of the city.\nParticipants: Kayvan Sarvi, Max Hacke, Gary Dupont, Olivia Wright, Lyza Rudyk, Stavros Pappavasiliou, Karl Karam, Merve Anil, Atta Yousefi, Uliana Apatina."

After I park I feel my phone vibrate. So I pull my phone out to surprisingly see the Twitter notification from NikeStore that reads, \u201c#NewRelease The Air Yeezy II (Black/Solar Red and Pure Platinum) are now available on NikeStore\u201d. Due to the random late night online releases of the Yeezy I\u2019s I honestly wasn\u2019t expecting the II\u2019s to release online the same day as their store release. But of course I clicked the link on my phone and selected my size 9.5 of the black/solar reds to put them in my cart. I was too late though. The servers had already crashed due to the heavy volume of traffic. Within a minute I was upstairs on my Macbook to see if I would have better luck from a computer. I got my sizes and added them to my cart. After what seemed like forever of blank \u201cloading\u201d screens and \u201csite maintenance\u201d my cart shows up with both colorways in my size. It seemed too good to be true, but I had futile hope. Throughout the entire fiasco I was on the phone with/texting my boys BJ, Dany, and Tayo because we were all trying to get pertinent info on the best way to handle the crashed servers based off of each others experience. I continually try to checkout and the page won\u2019t load. After about 5-6 times of refreshing, a new page comes up and I get this (smh): From \u201clurking\u201d on my favorite sneaker forum it seemed that almost everyone trying to get their hands on a pair online experienced a similar situation. Oh Nike I have been so loyal, for so long. All I wanted was one of each colorway. Next time just send them to me pre-release please. Thanks!"

When Yu Yu pointed his two fingers out, a cyan-colored thunderbolt dazzled out from between his fingers and struck on the enormous sword floating above his head, adding even greater power to the sword formation.\nWithin every single second, countless sky devils would scream out in despair, then be slaughtered by the frightful sword formation. Yu Yu, Priest Hua, Priest Qing Wei and Priest Mu had now joined their hands to manipulate Yu Yu\u2019s sword formation, which was known as the fiercest magic formation in Pan Gu world. Facing the sword formation and the four extra powerful beings, those sky devils were wiped out in a flash, turned into strands of smoke by the sword formation without leaving even a trace, despite the powerfulness of these traceless sky devils.\nJi Hao\u2019s heart was aching!\nIn the eyes of Yu Yu and the other three powerful beings, these traceless sky devils were evil things that could bring a disaster to this world. But to Ji Hao, these sky devils were incomparably precious treasures that could allow him to reach to a supremely high level, even climb to the top.\nSeeing those potential \u2018treasures\u2019 being destroyed one after another, crushed into ashes by the sword formation, Ji Hao was almost crying out. He didn\u2019t have the heart to look at those destroyed sky devils. Instead, he focused on Yu Yu, silently learning this powerful set of sword moves.\nYu Yu\u2019s spirit treasure was a sword. Without a doubt, he was a powerful sword artist. Ji Hao fortunately learned this set of sword moves from Yu Yu, and if he could truly find a nice sword, his power would be improved even further.\nEvery move, every step made by Yu Yu contained a marvelous feeling of the great Dao. Ji Hao was immersed in the mysteriousness of the great Dao. Gradually, a fierce sword intent began emerging from around his seed of Dao of sun, while dazzling beams of sword light became faintly visible.\nThe seed of Dao began spinning at its highest speed. Silently, Ji Hao pondered if Yu Yu\u2019s sword move could be combined with the moves of sky-opening, earth-splitting, everything-grow and everything-perish, how powerful would it become?\nGradually, Ji Hao\u2019s hands began moving along with Yu Yu\u2019s moves as well. Invisible streams of hot air puffed out from the tips of his ten fingers, tore the air into pieces and created extremely thin black traces.\nYu Yu delightfully nodded. Intentionally or not, when Yu Yu launched another wave of sword moves, he released a trace of his true spirit that generated an even stronger power of Dao from each of his moves, helping Ji Hao attain a deep understanding of this set of amazing sword moves.\nPriest Qing Wei looked at Yu Yu from a distance away, then disapprovingly shook his head. In Priest Qing Wei\u2019s eyes, Yu Yu had always been spoiling his disciples. For a thing like learning a set of sword move, disciples should complete for it by depending on their own talents and diligent cultivation. Why would a Shifu consume his own power to help his disciples learn? When tutoring his own disciples, Priest Qing We was never a silly good man like Yu Yu.\nPriest Hua and Priest Mu looked at Ji Hao with sulky faces while sensing the sword intent, spread out from Ji Hao\u2019s moving fingers. The sword intent was growing stronger and stronger, more and more mature.\nWatching another powerful disciple of Yu Yu rise, especially one who was the possessor of the Heaven and Earth golden bridge, Pan Xi divine mirror, nine suns spear and the immemorial sun streamer, along with many other supreme treasures as well\u2026This made Priest Hua and Priest Mu feel like their hearts were being bitten by countless rats.\nWhy wasn\u2019t Ji Hao a disciple of theirs?\nWhy didn\u2019t those treasures belong to them?\n\"All living beings are miserable!\" sighed Priest Mu while he released a palm move and slapped a few sky devils that rushed towards him into pieces.\n\"Save them with your mercy!\" Priest Hua responded from a distance away with a gentle, singing voice. Meanwhile, he clapped his hands and let a lotus slowly bloom in his palm. Next, countless lotus petals spun swiftly like a milestone, and the divine light released from the petals crushed hundreds of sky devils into a thin stream of mist.\nFour powerful beings combined their powers, with the fiercest magic formation in the world to seal the space. Within a couple of hours, tens of thousands of sky devils were destroyed for good.\nThe four powerful beings slightly waved their wide sleeves and let out a wave of thunderbolts that swept across the ground like a flood flushing through the earth. The thunderbolt waves scanned across this area sealed by the sword formation for tens of times and carefully checked every single corner. After making sure that all sky devils within the coverage of the sword formation were destroyed for good, these four powerful beings dropped their hands and smiled together.\nPriest Qing Wei began talking in a serious tone, \"Priest Hu and Priest Mu, my friends, the rest of this shall depend on you. More devils can certainly be found out there, \"\nPriest Mu nodded to Yu Yu and Qing Wei, then gave a long sigh and said in an extra bitter tone, \"I was careless. I didn\u2019t think that by cultivating in the Chaos with the primordial spirit power, I could give off a God-like power vibration and attract these terrifying beings.\"\nShaking his head, Priest Mu continued with a deep voice, \"This was started by me, and I shall take the responsibility.\"\nPriest Hua stood aside, grinned and said, \"Brother, you\u2019ve been too hard on yourself. These devils followed your power vibration to here. This means they were already not far from Pan Gu world. Even if you didn\u2019t cultivate in the Chaos, they would find this world sooner or later.\"\nKeeping that grin, Priest Hua continued in a relaxed tone, \"Brother, you sensed those devils ahead of time and drew them into Pan Gu world to allow us to catch the whole lot in a single move. This is good, virtuous\u2026 Why should you feel guilty?\"\nHearing Priest Hua, Qing Wei unpleasantly snorted, then gently flicked his dragon and tiger ruyi, prepared to start his chariot and leave.\nYu Yu laughed in a wield tone, then wielded the long sword held in his hand. He gently knocked the side of his right leg with the sword while slowly saying, \"My two friends, this isn\u2019t as easy as you think. If my brother and I didn\u2019t come to help you, this time, you might have caused a terrible disaster!\"\nReaching his left hand straight to before Priest Hua and Priest Mu\u2019 faces, Yu Yu then grinned and continued, \"Cut the crap. This time, your Master Yu Yu has done you such a great favor. Hurry, give something nice to seal my mouth! Otherwise, I will head to Spirit Wa\u2019s dojo right now and tell her everything that happened in here!\"\nPausing for a second, Yu Yu carried on with that weird tone, \"These sky devils are powerful, we all know that. Facing these devils, people like us can surely protect ourselves. But except for strong ones at our level, the other living beings could never survive. Priest Mu, this disaster you brought could truly be counted as destructive!\"\nPriest Mu\u2019s face turned darker and darker, more and more bitter. Priest Hua opened his mouth, but didn\u2019t know what to say.\nThese sky devils were indeed way too powerful.\nA long while later, Priest Mu gave a bitter grin and responded, \"Priest Yu Yu, my friend, you mean\u2026\"\nYu Yu laughed out loud, then he narrowed his eyes and said, \"I was going to meet my Shifu and sue you. My Shifu might not kill you, but he will certainly make you suffer! However, as we have been friends for so many years\u2026\"\nYu Yu pointed at Ji Hao, grinned and said, \"This disciple of your Master Yu Yu needs a nice sword. But you know, not every sword in the world can meet my requirement. Hmm, back then, you had attained an embryo sword from the Chaos, hadn\u2019t you?\"\nThe looks of Priest Hua and Priest Mu changed simultaneously.\nNineAnime is the best site to reading The Magus Era The Magus Era Chapter 886 free online.

The whitish glow near the bottom is the result of an electrical discharge.\nMatt Balme thought of a tornado when he sawhis first dust devil near Phoenix, Arizona. Now he looks forward to spendingnext summer chasing down dust devils in a four-wheel-drive truck to helpunderstand how such phenomena shape the Martian climate.\nScientists suspect that dustdevils on Mars help lift dust into the atmosphere and may feed the planet'sgiant dust storms, but they have yet to directly measure a dust devil on thered planet beyond some pressure readings and a few fleeting images.\nTerrestrial dust devils are seen as a decentanalogue for their Martian cousins.\n\"We're really hoping to be able toprovide raw data, hard numbers for people doing models for the Martianclimate,\" said Balme, a planetary scientist who splits his time betweenthe Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona and Open University in theU.K.\nThe hair-raising research aims to gauge thenumber and intensity of Earth dust devils within a one-square kilometer areabounded by three meteorological stations that will measure wind speed anddirection. Balme and his colleagues hope to link the presence of dust devils toany local \"twists\" in the wind that get detected by the stations.\nTornadoes and other major storm systems arefueled by regional temperature differences. But dust devils are much morelocal. They develop when ground temperatures are warmer than the surroundingair. The rising warm air creates a swirling vortex columnthat catches up dust and other particles as the whole setup races across thedesert, typically at just a few miles per hour.\nTo uncover more about the elusive dustdevils, chase teams of two to six people will race ahead of a dust devil at 40to 50 mph (64 to 80.5 kph) before getting in its path and slamming on thebrakes. That's the signal to use a modified winch on their truck's front end tolower a sensor package that can gauge pressure, temperature and dust-amounts asthe dust devil passes overhead.\nThe swirling vortexes can appear up to 130feet (40 meters) across and almost two-thirds of a mile (1 km) up, making astrange sound between a roaring noise and gentle sigh.\n\"Coming toward you it's quitethreatening,\" Balme told SPACE.com, describing his first experiencewaiting on a dust devil. However, the dust devil did nothing more than rufflehis hair and throw some dust grains in his face.\nA bigger problem comes from dust devilsproving, well, devilish. Balme has seen dust devils come right up to the truckbefore heading off in a different direction, leaving the team scrambling toraise their sensor package within a few seconds and go tearing off again.\nOne team will hunt dust devils near Eloy,Arizona, while another team spends time around Nevada's Eldorado Valley. Thedifferent climate areas should help provide a better understanding of how dustdevils can arise even in the cold landscape of Mars.\nThe NASA-backed study will also allow NiltonRenno, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Michigan and member of thePhoenixMars Lander team, to test climate model equations that try to describe howdust devils form.\n\"Rather than just stamp-collecting lotsof measurements of dust devils, we're actually going to try and tie them towhat's going on in the local climate,\" Balme said.\nSome changes become necessary to adapt thedata to a Mars model. For instance, the maximum spin velocity of dust devils onEarth is about 50 mph (80.5 kph), while dust devils on Mars may spin up to 200mph (322 kph) because of the thin atmosphere. Dust devils there are known tosoar six miles (10 km) into the atmosphere.\nImproved climate models should help betterunderstand the whirling dervishes of Mars, at least until future missions canobtain more direct measurements.\n\"It was such a shame when we saw thebeautiful MER [MarsExploration Rover] pictures,\" Balme noted. \"I was thinking that allwe need is a little wind sensor.\""

Activity increased as spring continued, but fell off again for about two weeks during a dust storm. As the dust storm faded away, dust devil activity came back. In the mid-afternoons as the summer solstice approached, dust devils were a very common occurrence on the floor of Gusev crater. The early-spring dust devils tended to move southwest-to-northeast, across the dust devil streaks in Gusev seen from orbit. Increasingly as the season progresses, the dust devils are seen moving northwest-to-southeast, in the same direction as the streaks. Scientists are watching for the big dust devils that leave those streaks. In this clip, contrast has been enhanced for anything in the images that changes from frame to frame, that is, for the dust moved by wind. The total time elapsed during the taking of these frames was 12 minutes, 25 seconds."

While everyone may spend their cash on games, clothes and event tickets, I save my money for restaurants, food trucks and fast food establishments.\nDespite my love for delicious cuisine, there are many eateries I haven\u2019t explored in Brevard County. When I lived at the northern end of the county, I rarely went south of U.S. 192. Now that I\u2019m settled in Palm Bay, I realized I have missed out on a lot of cool places.\nFlorida Tech\u2019s location is one of its best assets. It\u2019s near downtown, the city mall, tons of awesome tech companies, the beach and best of all, the restaurants! So, in my adventures going back to college, I consulted with students on their go-to haunts and many of them said the same thing: Old School Pizza and Broken Barrel Tavern.\nWhen a girl first hears the words \u201cBroken Barrel Tavern,\u201d she might imagine a bar in the Wild West with clinking glasses and patron fights. Oh, that\u2019s just me? Well, going to Broken Barrel off of Palm Bay Road was actually a treat. The building is spacious with a lot of tables, a giant bar area and pool tables for some extra fun. Food items include the regular salad, wings, sandwich combo, but what they specialize in is barbecue. Give me a pulled pork with fries (which are shaped like chips \u2014 so cool) and jalapeno corn bread from this place, any day. The owners of Broken Barrel are Florida Tech alumni, which is great not only for college pride, but these guys are also constantly supporting the university with tavern decorations, as well as attending and supplying food at athletic events. My favorite night out here is Trivia Thursdays. Trivia is another love of mine. Food and a knowledge competition? I\u2019m there!\nSo there you have it. Two fine establishments for the Florida Tech community and beyond. Hmm \u2026 what time is dinner again?\nThough you can\u2019t tell, here I am at Broken Barrel Tavern with my friend Keira chowing down on boneless wings and chili cheese fries."

                            "text": "Leading up to the American Theatre Wing's Tony Awards on June 9, Broadway does boffo business. Pre-theater dining options are wall-to-wall on the streets fanning out from Times Square, but supping afterward is more of a conundrum. Most restaurants in the area don't stay open late, presenting a problem if you're seeing a longish show and don't want the night to be over. We've got a few solutions where the curtain's still up and you'll see locals and theater folk alike. Read through our slideshow for details.\nThis snug bordello-red hideaway is one level up from Theatre District standby Hourglass Tavern. Though hourglasses are part of the decor, the liquor pours are so generous it's easy to lose track of time in the wee hours. The super-friendly barman serves until 4am; the kitchen closes a few hours earlier (usually at midnight) depending on the night. Post-show \u201csnacklettes\u201d include a heap of chicken meatballs drenched in tomato sauce and roasted garlic polenta topped with fresh mozzarella and basil. The Mediterranean bent continues with several salads and savory puff pastries stuffed with spinach and feta. It's inexpensive and casual, attracting Hell's Kitchen locals and a fair share of stagehands, chorines and chorus boys. Just in case your show lets out early, happy hour lasts until 10pm every night, with well drinks for only $5.\nSince 1965, industry types and big-name stars have frequented Joe Allen, one of those places that must be sprinkled with pixie dust to still be so animated. All around you is a murmur of show talk by show people. The brick-walled space is famously adorned with posters of flops like High Fidelity and Moose Murders, making for great instant-conversation fodder. Crowds flood in when the theaters let out, but it's fairly easy to secure a bar stool or table. Still, make a reservation just to be safe; the staff knows the running time of everything on Broadway, so they'll be able to tell you when you should expect to arrive for dinner. Once you're seated, no one will make a fuss if you just want a cocktail and sides of saut\u00e9ed spinach and french fries or perhaps chocolate pudding cake saturated with hot fudge. The American menu is straightforward and a good value\u2014it's filled with classics like a fat burger and an old-fashioned omelet with spinach and cheddar.\nMake a beeline for the upstairs saloon after a show. A wall of windows overlooks the Broadhurst Theatre, and, if you time it right, you can see Tom Hanks signing autographs after tearing up the stage in Lucky Guy. Sardi's has a sea of big tables, and it's not uncommon for an entire cast to be gathered around one, telling tales and clinking glasses. Yes, tourists predominate, but locals have a soft spot for it, too, perhaps because the classic cocktails are strong and not badly priced. Sadly, the signature cheese spread and crackers are no longer free, but you don't have to shell out a lot for a late-night supper. Split the giant chicken club sandwich and french fries or get an appetizer portion of the creamy cannelloni au gratin. There's such a convivial vibe here that strangers often strike up conversations with one another\u2014and, of course, it's always amusing to behold the caricatures of showbiz folk deluging the walls.\nIf you love fine tequila, Toloache (pronounced toe-lo-AH-chay) has by far the best selection in the Theatre District. Roughly 100 bottles of the distilled beverage glitter at the tiled bar, an excellent place to sip it straight or in a tart margarita along with some chips and thick guacamole. The bi-level bistro is splashed with vibrant Mexican art and lit by lovely multicolored hanging lamps. Julian Medina, of Mexico City, is the chef/owner, preparing elevated yet approachable dishes like suckling pig tacos, avocado fries, lobster ceviche and quesadillas with sea scallops and bacon\u2013Mexican chocolate pico de gallo. The kitchen serves until 10pm Sunday and Monday, 11pm Tuesday through Thursday and until midnight on weekends, but you can linger over drinks for as long as you like.\nNot a lot has changed at Zuni since it opened in 1992. It's cozy and rarely crowded, and the prices have stayed low. Finding a glass of wine for $7 and a well drink for $6 is akin to time travel. The bar food, tasty and satisfying, also harks back: chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks with tomato dipping sauce, a plate of nachos fired up with jalape\u00f1os and canopied with cheese. Another reason to sit at the bar is to talk theater with Scott the bartender, who's a playwright and sees several shows each season. The full menu, including a burger with barbecued frizzled onions on an English muffin and pan-roasted skate with lemon, caper and toasted almond sauce, is served until midnight every night. No glitz, no glamour here\u2014just a place to relax, refuel and chat before bedtime."

Alex Crevar the author of this article shares his experience on the mountains of Macedonia.\n\u2018For explorers and adventure travellers who don\u2019t know this undiscovered expanse of Macedonia, a country on the Balkan Peninsula in southeastern Europe, an excursion to this dovetailing string of summits and massifs (which include the \u0160ar, Bistra and Jablanica Mountains) means some of the best, and most unheralded, hiking on the continent. But even for the horseback members of the group assembled \u2013 all of whom live in the Balkans and have spent a significant amount of time scaling the region\u2019s topography \u2013 this was a treat.\u2019 says Alex.\nOver the course of eight days, we would hike (and gallop) stages that began in northwestern Macedonia, straddle the Kosovo border, and then steer south along the Albanian frontier. Our journey traversed a national park, and included visits to centuries-old Orthodox churches and a monastery built by St Clement more than 1000 years ago. We stayed in huts wedged into hillsides, and woke with frosty morning dew clinging to our tents. We had stove-cooked-coffee conversations with locals about a myriad of subjects from politics to sheep shearing, and watched as those same locals dragged thick, work-tested fingers across smudged maps and explained how the mountains here once defined the edges of Yugoslavia. The journey ended on the shores of the ancient, Unesco-protected, tectonic Lake Ohrid, 300m deep and stretching over 34km.\nAs we cantered back into Sherpa\u2019s Gali\u010dnik ranch, the sun had shifted to the other side of the horizon. We were worn out and dusty, but immediately buoyed by dinner. The smell of green, red and yellow piquant peppers, cooking naked on an iron stove, wafted above the corral. Wedges of young, white cheese sat beside pans of a savoury pastry called burek, and waited on a rough-sawn table. We sat and clinked glasses of strong, amber-coloured rakija."

                            "text": "Never before have I had a whole week off from school during Thanksgiving. Not having to work the Monday through Wednesday before the most important food day of the year was honestly an amazing treat. Not only was I able to pretty much cook everything in advance (except the turkey, of course), but also I was able to enjoy the season with friends and family. The Florida weather was perfectly seasonal, and even a deep-freeze warning one night brought back memories of cold, Oregon mornings, where Rob and I first started celebrating this holiday together.\nAs I looked around my living room last Saturday night, there were all the signs of the weekend after Thanksgiving: a couple dishes with creative leftovers lunches on the coffee table, Rob in and out of naps, college football on the TV, Sig and his cousin, Turner, also in an out of naps (but trying really hard to stay awake thus something, just something, happens where us humans will need their K-9 expertise \u2013 like cleaning up turkey bits), Jenn uploading silly pictures of us on her computer, and just as dusk was creeping up over the golf course, we are all probably very thankful that some lights were accidently left on because none of us were getting up from our comfy, blanket-nested spots on the couches. Well, I know I wasn\u2019t.\nSpicy Leek and Sweet potato souffl\u00e9 (with browned marshmallows!) \u2013 some of these ended up on the wall. Not exactly sure what happened.\nPumpkin, Amaretto Custard and Whipped Cream Trifle. SO GOOD.\nOk, so Thanksgiving food is wonderful, obviously. But Jennifer and I indulged in a leftover that was unlike the standard midnight turkey sandwich (don\u2019t get me wrong, that sandwich is probably the most perfect thing I could eat \u2013 ever. Like, ever, ever.). So, after a couple glasses of wine, a lovely combination of the French-Canadian Poutine dish, American Thanksgiving, and a late-night Mexican tradition all found themselves together in a happy little co-mingling of sorts, creating an indulgence perfect for only the days after Thanksgiving. There was honestly not a lot of thought to this dish, so there wasn\u2019t much measuring. Actually, there was no measuring at all. But with these ingredients, you only need to go with what you like.\nI preheated the oven to 350 degrees, and put blue corn tortilla chips on an ovenproof plate. Then, I spooned some leftover turkey gravy (the Poutine part), and sprinkled an abundance of leftover turkey meat over the chips. Taking a shredded Mexican cheese blend, I spread the cheese evenly over the chips and popped it in the oven to melt. When the OMG-amazing-super-delicious-ooey-gooey-cheesy-turkey-smell wafted through the kitchen, I took out the Turkey & Gravy Nachos, topped them with scallions and hot sauce, and Jennifer and I devoured them. Really, not a morsel left.\nSo, we\u2019re eating a lot of sushi. Happy Holidays!"

Located in the heart of the KL city centre, it consists of a restaurant, bar and lounge. In the private elevator the atmosphere is hushed, but when you pass through the front doors the feel turns into one of refined elegance with the sounds of champagne glasses clinking and quiet chatter.\nThe dining area d\u00e9cor is white with casual, modern furnishings: meanwhile, the bar has art deco furniture and neon lights, and the lounge has a Havana-esque feel with brown leather sofas in different sizes. Paintings from Italian artist, Rosalba Mangione hang on the walls, while floor-to-ceiling windows and a glass roof provide great views of KL.\nOffering Italian food, the restaurant has \u00e0 la carte options but we liked the specials that our server recommended, like the spaghetti with botargo (mullet roe) and almonds \u2013 it had terrific texture and lots of flavour. Also good was the pan-fried sea bass stuffed with shrimp and lemon dressing \u2013 a terrific, zesty dish. Portions are small but each dish has unforgettable taste.\nThe bar has an extensive selection of wines, but there are also great cocktails and champagnes. Meanwhile, the Lounge (looking very much like an exclusive gentleman\u2019s club) is for those who want to sip on their Highland Park, Yamakazi, Johnnie Walker Blue and Johnnie Walker Gold in style. Tavern-style shelves house a collection of bottles that include single cask whiskies from independent bottlers and special-edition scotches from big distilleries.\nIn the background an in-house deejay alternates between haunting, soul-searching smooth jazz, dance tunes and techno beats, but the music plays softly so you can converse easily.\nPetronas Tower 3 is set adjacent to Suria KLCC: there is an elevator beside the Versace store in Suria KLCC shopping mall which links directly to Petronas Tower 3. Alternatively, from Mandarin Oriental hotel, turn right: from here you can see the Cartier store and Petronas Tower 3.

Foreigners traveling in America often remarked that the Americans copied the latest European fashions and were as well-dressed as folk in London or Paris. There were, however, some exceptions. In parts of rural New York, old-style Dutch fashions were still seen. German influence was strong in parts of Pennsylvania, and Highland Scottish clothing was worn by people in parts of western Virginia and North Carolina. Religious sects such as the Quakers wore distinctive clothing. On the frontiers, Indian garments were adopted or copied by pioneer families and hunters. In South Carolina and Georgia, colonists adopted forms of dress compatible with the warm climate. Dress in rural areas was usually more rude and simple than in the towns where people were more fashion-conscious and where bolts of cloth, buttons and other embellishments were more available.\n1. The LAMPLIGHTER wears a striped workman's jacket, a double-breasted waistcoat or vest, leather breeches and a short apron. At his waist he carries a bundle of lampwicks and scissors for trimming them. He totpes his ladder and oil pot for filling the lamps.\n2. The SAILING MASTER was a warrant officer and navigator aboard ship. Naval officers usually wore uniforms, but seamen did not; warrant officers are usually depicted in seamen's dress. He wears a sailor's jacket, kerchief, a small cocked hat and petticoat trousers--short full trousers coming to just below the knee, made of coarse linen or old, worn sail canvas. The trousers were a protective garment; breeches worn underneath them were kept clean during work on deck.\n3. The BROOM SELLER was a peddler who cried his wares through the streets of town. He wears a workman's jacket, a small round felt hat and breeches of mattress ticking.\n4. The young HOUSE SERVANT is a slave dressed in livery--clothing in the colors of the family whom he serves. Black servants often wore turbans which, people felt, lent them a romantic African appearance. House servants in slavery were often forced to wear silver collars engraved with their owner's name.\n5. The SHEPHERD wears a broad-brimmed felt hat for protection against the elements. A long surtout or watch coat, a farmer's shirt of coarse linen and leather breeches comprise his outfit. About his ankles he wears short gaiters or \"spatter dashes.\" He totes a soldier's tin canteen and a haversack for his food. In his hand he carries a shepherd's crook.\n6. The FARMER AND HIS WIFE wear simple, practical clothing. He wears a workingman's jacket, Osnaburg linen trousers and apron, and Indian moccasins. Over his shoulder is slung a small wooden keg of water. She wears a man's felt hat, a surtout, apron and skirt.\n7. This SERVANT GIRL wears a scarf knotted about her head, a long checked kerchief over her shoulders (usually tucked into her apron) and a white linen or cotton apron over her dress. The dress, like that of most working women, is without hoops.\n8. The SMITH wears a simple woolen cap, a checked linen shirt and a leather apron. His stockings are of worsted and he wears leather slippers. He files ironwork held in a vise.\n9. The WAGGONER wears a frock, a long, smock-like shirt made of coarse canvas-like linen. A broad-brimmed felt hat protects his head from the weather. To protect his legs he wears \"country boots\" -- strips of blanket tied below the knee and at the ankle.\n10. The COACHMAN wears a watch coat over a single-breasted coat, a striped vest, leather breeches and heavy jackboots. His cocked hat is of the style worn by fashionable gentlemen.\n11. The FRONTIERSMAN wears a fringed hunting shirt of linen or cloth over a homespun checked shirt. His leggings and moccasins are Indian style, and his breeches are of deer or moose skin. His shot bag is hung from a beaded Indian belt. His powder horn, fashioned from a cow's horn, is slung from a rawhide cord.\n12. The CHIMNEY SWEEP AND BOY are in soiled and blackened work clothes. Their compact dress is designed for easy movement inside chimneys and fireplaces. They both carry long blanket-like dropcloths for catching soot. The sweep carries a sectioned broom which can be telescoped out to great length for cleaning chimneys, and from his belt hangs a canvas container for soot. The boy wears mules or slippers rather than shoes, and carries a short broom.\n13. The COOPER wears a woolen or knitted cap, a checked vest and a leather apron. His cloth breeches are missing a knee buckle. About his neck he wears a kerchief, as did many workingmen.\n14. This GENTLEMAN wearing a suit ornately bound with gold lace is headed for a very forman affair. He wears a powdered wig and carries a small sword. The whole outfit is a bit old-fashioned for its time.\n15. The STREET PORTER earned his bread by carrying heavy burdens through the streets. He wears a cocked hat in the style of the 1750s. His old-fashioned tattered frock coat is a bit long for the period. On his legs he wears country boots--simple leggings made from lengths of old blanket tied at the ankle and below the knee. On his back is a carrying frame.\n16. These UPPER-CLASS CHILDREN are casually dressed, as for play. The boy has taken off his coat and hat, and holds a cricket bat. He wears a linen shirt without ruffles, buckled shoes, and breeches that buckle below the knee. The little girl wears a simple summer dress with white linen ruffled cuffs and a straw hat with a ribbon.\n17. The BARBER--like the tailor--was usually dressed in gentleman's clothing, but the cocked hat and coat on the one shown above are in the style of twenty years earlier. The bib of his apron is buttoned to his vest. In his pockets are scissors and a razor. A pewter shaving bowl is under his arm. In his left hand he carries a device for powdering wigs. He carries his comb in his wig while delivering another wig to a customer.\n18. The MILKMAID wears a linen mob cap, a simple spotted bodice and a cotton blouse. Her apron is of coarse linen and her tattered homespun skirt has seen years of service.\n19. The WATER CARRIER wears an old felt hat, cocked up in back. For warmth he has knotted a scarf about his head, covering his ears. His old cat has no collar; it is of the period of about 1745. His waistcoat has a speckled pattern. As did many poor people, he wears shoes that tie rather than buckle.\n20. Both these CHAIRMEN wear heavy surtouts with capes made to button up and cover the wearer's face up to the eyes in bad weather. The man on the right wears a Scotch bonnet and offers his companion a pinch of snuff from his horn. The man on the left wears a linen stock or neckpiece, buckled at the back. Sedan chairs were the taxicabs of eighteenth-century cities of Europe and America.\n21. The FASHIONABLE YOUNG MAN wears a bound cocked hat with silver cords, a cambric neck cloth, and a fine ruffled linen shirt. His spotted coat is known as a \"frock.\" His vest is bound with silver lace. He wears two watches with tassled fobs descending below the skirts of his vest. His silk stockings have embroidered 'clocks' from ankle to calf. His hair is powdered. He carries a cane but wears no sword (they were beginning to go out of fashion with young men at about this time).\n22. The FOUNDRY WORKER wears a broad-brimmed hat which might be cocked up and caught to the crown with looping. His single-breasted frock coat reaches to just above his knees, and his linen or canvas apron reaches his shoes.\n23. The GLASSBLOWER is dressed for work in a factory near furnaces producing great heat. His eye shield protects him against flying sparks. An ordinary coarse linen shirt and a smock-like apron falling down in front and back are his only garments apart from his buckled shoes.\n24. The HOUSEWIFE wears a beribboned mob cap, a spotted bodice with a kerchief beneath, a striped apron and a heavy wool skirt. She carries a pail for fetching water.\n25. This FASHIONABLE LADY is dressed for a grand affair such as a ball. Her lofty headdress is topped with a spangled turban mounted with ostrich feathers. She wears a silk polonaise gown with bows and flowers over a petticoat with a gauze flounce. In her hand she carries a fan.\n26. The DOCTOR was immediately known by his full 'physical' wig, his black suit and his gold-headed cane. His buttons and shoe buckles are of silver.\n27. The WHEELWRIGHT wears a short jacket, round felt hat, leather breeches (tied at the knee, rather than buckled) and Indian moccasins. A leather apron is tied around his waist.\n28. The town WATCHMAN was the eighteenth-century equivalent of the modern policeman on his beat. He wears a long watch coat, a single-breasted jacket bound at the waist by a leather belt, cloth breeches and worsted stockings. He carries a tin lantern and heavy oak stick. A clay pipe is stuck in his hatband. Over his shoulder on a cord hangs a 'battle rattle,' which gives off a loud clatter if swung vigorously, thereby summoning assistance in time of trouble.\n29. The LADY IN RIDING DRESS wears what was then considered a rather masculine outfit. Her jacket is somewhat military in cut, with cuffs and silver-bound buttonholes. Her round felt hat is decorated with ribbons, rosettes and ostrich feathers. In her hand she carries a leather riding crop.\n30. The TAILOR is dressed in the fashion of the upper classes whom he serves, with the exception of the workingman's kerchief around his neck. He wears a 'snuff-colored' cuit, and a small cocked hat. Around his neck he carries measuring tapes, and in his vest pocket a pair of scissors.\n31. The MUSICIAN is dressed in an old-fashioned costume, even to his long, full-bodied wig. His full-sleeved coat and long-skirted vest are of the fashion of the 1740s. He wears a ruffled shirt and linen stock.\n32. The KNIFE GRINDER, a street peddler, wears a battered castor hat, a checked neckerchief and an old-fashioned coat with buttonholes to the bottom edge. There were once buttons on his cuffs but they have long since disappeared. He wears homemade leggings of mattress ticking and a bibbed apron tied at the waist. On his feet he wears tattered Indian moccasins.\n33. The GOLFING GENTLEMAN wears a distinctive costume designed to warn passersby (especially shepherds and herders in rural areas) that a game is in progress. This custom lasted almost a hundred years. His rather military-looking 'coatee' is double-breasted in soldier fashion. His vest is of the short skirtless fashion becoming popular in the late 1770s. His fine linen shirt is generously furrled at the breast and wrists.\n34. The BUTCHER wears a woolen cap, striped vest and a blue bibbed apron fastened at the neck. On his arms he wears removable protective sleeves to keep his shirt clean. About his waist he carries a wooden case of knives and a sharpening steel.\n35. The LANTERN SELLER was another street peddler. He wears a surtout with a cape, and leggings similar to those of a soldier. Over his shoulder hangs a haversack for carrying some of his smaller lanterns.\n36. The clothing of the QUAKER COUPLE tends to be somewhat old-fashioned for the period. He wears a surtout over his shoulders and a dark, sober suit of clothes. His round hat is not fashionably cocked up. His wife's dark and conservative gown is worn with a white bib and is modestly decorated with a flower.\n37. The FISHERMAN wears a knitted Monmouth cap, a sailor's jacket and trousers, and heavy leather sea boots. His shirt is of coarse linen. He carries a boat hook and a heaving line.\n38. The SHOPKEEPER wears a hat with cockades on three sides. His hair is curled and powdered, and his frock coat is typical of the 1770s. His apron is of green baize and his stockings are worsted.\n39. The FISHMONGER of Boston wears a small round felt hat edged with white tape. His vest is double-breasted, and his short jacket is very simple, with no cuffs, lining or pockets. He wears red baize trousers and a canvas apron probably fashioned from old sail. He holds a wooden shovel for loading baskets of fish.\n40. This CARPENTER, a free black man, wears typical workingman's dress--a cocked hat, a seaman-style jacket, and trousers. He wears no stockings and has laced shoes rather than the more fashionable buckled ones. He is leveling the surface of a board with a draw knife.\n41. This HARPOONER is a Gay Head Indian, of Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts--many members of the tribe served in the American whaling fleet. He wears a brightly colored kerchief bound about his head, a jacket buttoned to the neck, and wide petticoat trousers made of old sail canvas that come to just below the knee. He is barefoot, as he might be aboard ship or in a whaleboat in moderate weather. He carries a harpoon and a length of line.\n42. The POST RIDER carried the mail between towns. He is dressed in the fashion of the English post rider of the same period, with a leather cap and a red surtout or watch coat. His breeches are leather and he wears heavy riding boots. In one hand he carries gloves; in the other the post horn for announcing his arrival in town. A large valise containing the mail is secured behind the saddle.\n43. This well-equipped RURAL MILITIAMAN (5th Worcester County Regiment, Massachusetts) is dressed in the Sunday clothes of a small farmer. His coat, vest and trousers are of homespun, made and dyed by the women of the farm. His broad-brimmed hat is decorated with a sprig of pine and a cockade of ribbon. Hung from a military waist-belt is a tomahawk instead of a bayonet. He carries a homemade wooden canteen and a soldier's knapsack. His gun is an old-fashioned Hudson Valley fowler, not a military weapon. Slung over his left shoulder are a shot pouch and powder horn.\n44. The TANNER wears a heavy leather apron over another apron of sheepskin, suspended from the shoulders and secured at the waist. The leather apron is also secured by a belt at the waist. Leather leg guards from knee to ankle protect him from the strong fluid called 'ooze' and the vitriolic acid that were used for tanning hides. The tanner's hands were usually indelibly stained and colored by these fluids. He has one kerchief bound about his head and one about his neck. He works in shirt sleeves and vest.\n45. The CHEROKEE INDIAN CHIEF wears a silver gorget and peace medal about his neck; he probably acquired both trinkets from the colonial authorities before the War. His scarlet blanket cloak and linen shirt are not of Indian manufacture, nor is the cloth from which his leggings are made. These items were probably acquired in trade at the frontier trading post. His face is scarred in a design which idenifies his tribe. He wears feathers in his hair and a striped tunic bound and secured at the waist with wampum belts. On his wrists he wears silver bracelets.\n46. The WIGMAKER wears a gentleman's sleeved waistcoat of striped silk, a bibbed apron tied about his neck, buckled knee breeches, stockings and leather slippers. His ruffled shirt is of fine linen and, of course, he wears a powdered wig."

A short stocky bald man, with a scowl on his face, emerged from the kitchen wearing an apron and carrying a tray. The man tossed two plates of turnip tacos in front of them and began to pick up the tower of plates collecting at the center of the table.\nThe man grunted and set the stack back down on the table. He turned and stomped back toward the swinging kitchen door.\nThere was a crash on the other side of the swinging door as the man in the apron kicked it open and marched into the kitchen.\n\u201cI think he\u2019s mad,\u201d Bob said. They paused and admired their tower of empty plates that nearly reached the ceiling.\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t hang up a sign if you don\u2019t mean it,\u201d Woodruff said, and pointed to the All-You-Can-Eat Turnips sign in the front window.\nWoodruff and Bob furrowed their brows and surveyed one another for a moment. When Bob consumed the last turnip taco Woodruff turned around and looked back toward the kitchen door.\nThe scowling man in the apron returned from the kitchen and laid a pair of bacon wrapped skewers on the table. The bacon was still sizzling when Bob scooped up the skewer nearest him and popped it in his mouth.\n\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d the man said with a frown.\n\u201cNo more turnips?\u201d Woodruff asked.\nHe stormed off to the kitchen and briefly got his apron caught in the swinging door. Bob gulped down the glass of chocolate goat milk next to his plate.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s his deal?\u201d Woodruff asked.\n\u201cAnd Mr. Scowling Face threw such a fit when we milked her,\u201d Bob said and patted the black and white goat on the head.\n\u201cHe should,\u201d Bob said. \u201cNo turnip ice cream when you\u2019re serving scolding hot bacon. That\u2019s irresponsible.\n\u201cSo, why Robbie?\u201d Woodruff asked.\n\u201cIt makes me sound younger,\u201d Bob replied.\n\u201cLike spitting?\u201d Bob asked. He stood up and pushed his chair back under the table.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good tip,\u201d Woodruff said.\nThe man in the apron stepped out from behind the swinging door with a Polaroid camera. He walked up to Woodruff and Bob, who were standing next to the leaning tower of plates while Delilah chewed on the tablecloth. The man growled as he raised the camera and a blindly light flashed in their eyes. A card printed out the bottom and the man angrily shook it as he moved behind the counter. With a thumbtack, he pinned the picture next to a red sign above the cash register that said \u2018We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone\u2019.\n\u201cSweet!\u201d Woodruff and Bob cheered in unison.\n\u201cWe got our picture on the wall,\u201d Bob said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna be famous,\u201d Woodruff replied.\nBob pulled open the front door and they stepped out onto the sidewalk with Delilah trailing behind them.\n\u201cYou wanna see a movie or something?\u201d Woodruff said.\n\u201cSun Valley 10 is playing She\u2019s Having a Baby for Totally 80\u2019s Thursdays,\u201d Bob said.\n\u201cMeh eheheh eh,\u201d Delilah bleated."

It operates the third largest pizza delivery and take-out chain in the United States. Papa John\u2019s is headquartered in a suburb of Louisville, Kentucky in the town of Jeffersontown.\nThe founder and CEO, John Schnatter, of Papa John\u2019s has a unique story on how his restaurant began. John always enjoyed the pizza business. He started working at Rocky\u2019s, a pizza and sub shop in his hometown of Jeffersonville, Indiana and fell in love with creating pizzas. He went off to college and began working at Greek\u2019s Pizzeria and wanted to drop out of college to open his own restaurant, however his parents talked him out of it. He decided to put his dream on the back burner and to finish college, knowing upon graduating he would have the knowledge and abilities to open his own store. He just needed a name for his restaurant.\nSchnatter knew of a student who was a marketing major that lived six doors down from him in the LaFollette dorm at Ball State. He told his fellow student his dream of his pizza restaurant and asked him if he could come up with a name and logo. A few days later, this student came back with a name and logo Schnatter really liked, and John told him if his dream ever flourishes he would give him a free pizza every week for life. He figures he owes him about $16,000 in free pizzas, however to date he hasn\u2019t been able to make good on his promise for free weekly pizzas as he doesn\u2019t know the student's name, only that he was a native of Chicago. But he knows he owes him good.\nIn 1984 John was running the bar, Mick\u2019s Lounge that he co-owned with his father. He convinced his business partner; Bob Ehringer (he had purchased the elder Schnatter\u2019s stake in this business) that supplementing their profits with pizza was a sound idea. He decided it was time to pursue his real dream. He sold his beloved Camaro Z28 to buy equipment and converted the broom closet of Mick\u2019s Lounge into his pizza business. In the beginning Schnatter and Ehringer literally slept at bar to ensure they would not miss calls for the new pizza business. In the first six months the pizza side of the business only generated $1,000 to $1,500 per week and was dependent on the income from the bar. But word of mouth spread quickly and by March 1985 they were making 3,000 to 4,000 pizzas a week.\nIn that same year the partners opened their first Papa John\u2019s restaurant in a retail spot next door to Mick\u2019s Lounge. The restaurant quickly was able to generate profits and stand on its own financially and the company was incorporated in 1986. They also started franchising this year. This little broom closet idea turned Papa John\u2019s into an extremely successful business that now has over 4,700 establishments around the world.\nPapa John\u2019s primarily is a take-out and delivery restaurant, however some stores do have tables and chairs set up for in store dining. They still value the original focus which was based on the quality of the pizza which includes fresh traditional pizza dough, 100% real cheese to vine-ripened fresh packed tomato sauce and many other premium ingredients.

Ogle Cultural and Community Center at IU Southeast.\nFor years, Greenfield and his business partner Ben Cohen satisfied the country\u2019s sweet tooth, but now he\u2019ll share with Southern Indiana how they turned one local ice cream shop into a multimillion dollar business.\nGreenfield and Cohen opened the first Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream parlor in 1978 and have since used a unique business plan to combine social responsibility with a profitable business.\nThey have been recognized for their commitment to social and environmental causes by the Council on Economic Priorities and the U.S. Small Business Administration. Along with Cohen, Greenfield has received the James Beard Humanitarian of the Year award and the Peace Museum\u2019s Community Peacemakers of the Year award.\nThe pair sold Ben & Jerry\u2019s to Unilever in 2000. Greenfield remains the President of the Ben & Jerry\u2019s Foundation. He is also a board member for the Institute of Sustainable Communities, a group that provides people across the globe with the tools they need to create environmentally sustainable communities.\nThe Sanders Speaker Series is named after Judge Carlton and Sue Sanders, whose generous donation established the Sanders Speaker Series Endowment in 2008.\nThe couple\u2019s goal for the series is to bring high-profile speakers to the University, at least annually, to speak to the community about business and the economy.\nAdmission is complimentary for the Feb. 21 event, but seating is limited and tickets are required.

After a few words of comfort and a prayer, the missionary turned to leave.\nAs he walked away, he felt the tug of a pleading hand on his arm and saw two sad eyes behind the haunting touch. Softly, she said, \u201cThe girl in the broom closet\u2026 please pray for her.\u201d Silence then hung in the air as those sad eyes pointed to the end of the hall. When the missionary turned back around, no one was there.\nAll the doors were numbered\u2026 except the last one on the left.\nThere, hesitantly, the missionary knocks and waits. Silence. Unlocked. The door is unlocked. He enters. It really was a broom closet.\nThe closet packed the terrible smell of decaying blood.\nThe slender beam of light from the hall turned the darkness into dark brown as the missionary saw the narrow cot pushed up against the wall.\nThe tattered sheet that barely covered her was much too transparent. Every decimated bone was showing through, screaming out her pain in narrow lines.\nThe sheet was not enough to cover the oozing of blood and life, caking on her in a dark crimson stench.

The fear of being an Entrepreneur who is starting something new without a lot of experience was a challenge.\nI was to leave everything for pursuing a journey which was unpredictable.\nEspecially, when we had a bad start to our journey.\nHad it not been for some backing from my father in the initial years of my business, I would have quit sooner than expected.\nAll I had with me was a passion for doing something of my own.\nWe worked tirelessly to stay afloat. We called it the \u201cfight for survival\u201d.\nI am in my early 30s. I meet a lot of aspiring entrepreneurs who plan to start their venture soon. Most of them do not want to be an Entrepreneur because they have no clue how they will face fears of being a Solo Entrepreneur.\nBusinesses are unpredictable. The failure rate in business is as high as 50%.\nStartups are worse with failure. The failure rate in startups is higher than conventional businesses.\nIsn\u2019t starting something new with high unpredictability a risk?\nWould you want to take such a risk?\nThe fear of failure in businesses definitely dissuades aspiring entrepreneurs from turning into an Entrepreneur.\nWhat if you are not the business owner you thought you would be?\nWhat if you lose everything you have built over the years?\nWhat if you cannot handle your teams?\nWhat if your degrees or experience is not up to mark?\nThe fear of failure is the topmost reason for entrepreneurs to stay away from businesses.\nMy family has been more than supportive in supporting me in my entrepreneurial journey.\nThere have been times, I have even penniless.\nThere have been times, I have had been under tremendous pressure.\nThey have stood rock solid behind me through thick and thin of times.\nHow many of us can claim to have such support from their families?\nOne of my friends wanted to start a venture for the last 5 years.\nThe last time he had the funds to start one, his family decided to buy an expensive flat.\nThe friend desperately wanted to start the venture with the money but the family wanted the flat.\nToday, they own the expensive flat with the EMIs on their head.\nThe friend has kissed goodbye to the entrepreneurial dream.\nBeing an entrepreneur could mean cutting the luxuries for a few months or years.\nThe same luxuries you could enjoy without thinking when you were in the job.\nYour friends will have their planned holidays backed by their consistent salary incomes.\nBelieve me, startups have the power to derail your normal \u201cfamily\u201d life.\nWouldn\u2019t it be too harsh for your family to live your dream?\nThat\u2019s what most of us think. The family pressure keeps us away from our startup journey.\nStartups or any kind of business need investment.\nLast week, I was approached by a young student in college who sells perfumes and deodorants through his e-commerce website.\nThey are not able to scale up top next level because of lack of funds.\nLast year our business lost all its steam because we could not raise funding from our banks.\nOnly when we changed our banks, were we able to raise funds for our startup in India .\nImagine a situation where banks refuse to fund you and you do not have an investor on board.\nAdd to the above scenario, the situation where you are \u201cinvesting\u201d money in your business.\nThere are case studies on entrepreneurs who have lost their complete investments.\nEven if you have the money, will you consider business as a good financial investment?\nLosing money in businesses is not something new but the after effect of losing this money is not spoken in clear terms.\nWhy would you want to invest or raise funds for a venture which might leave you with financial liability for a lifetime?\nThe financial risk with starting a business keeps many of us away from starting a venture.\nLife after entrepreneurship is not easy.\nI have already mentioned earlier, what your family might go through when you decide to be an entrepreneur.\nThink of the long hours you will spend in hours with no weekends to speak of.\nAre you willing to let go of the luxuries of your life for just being an \u201cEntrepreneur\u201d?\nThe other day, a friend openly admitted, he wants to start a venture but finds the life of an entrepreneur scary.\nHe said he would rather be an employee than being a boss living with so much pressure.\nYou just might have to let go of the expensive flat. Swanky car. The luxurious holiday to save money for your dream.\nThe dark side of being an Entrepreneur is not rosy. The aspiring Entrepreneurs fears facing the demons of being an Entrepreneur.\nIt keeps most of the aspiring entrepreneurs from becoming an entrepreneur.\nI recommend everyone who wants to be an entrepreneur to assess the current financial and personal standing.\nTest their business idea before taking the plunge.\nThere are so many reasons which are stopping you from being an entrepreneur.\nWhy not sit down and think about \u201cwhy you should be an entrepreneur\u201d and then take a calculated risk.\nLet\u2019s not be one because everyone you know is so gung-ho over being an Entrepreneur."

With his department unceremoniously done away with, John decides to visit the continent in search of culture, adventure\u2026anything to get him away from the crushing monotony of his life.\nIt is said that everybody has a doppelg\u00e4nger, somewhere in the world. Held up changing trains, John goes to a bar. It is there that he spots Johnny Spence and feels a bolt of electricity. Johnny is his mirror image \u2013 the likeness is uncanny. They drink into the night, discussing their problems, transfixed by their similarity.\nJohn is in search of human connection, Johnny craves an escape from his responsibilities \u2013 he is an aristocratic landowner, reluctantly heading home after a disastrous business venture. The two men spend the night in the same hotel. But when John awakes the next morning, Johnny is nowhere to be seen \u2013 and a driver wants to take John \u201chome\u201d. Some deep impulse responds to the crack of opportunity, and John literally steps into his double\u2019s shoes.\nArriving at the crumbling stately home, John discovers a house swarming with people. Johnny is in possession of a beautiful young wife and an eerily precocious daughter, a brother and sister seething with resentment and a mistress who happens to be his sister- in-law. Finally, John meets Lady Spence \u2013 Johnny\u2019s opium addicted mother, who broods over the house from her upstairs bedroom.\nSo pure is the resemblance Johnny\u2019s family are instantly taken in by his substitute. John negotiates the initial hurdles clumsily, but without giving himself away. Thereafter, he begins to understand the various crises facing the family. Johnny\u2019s fecklessness has allowed them to slip into financial ruin. The glass foundry attached to the house has suffered decades of mismanagement. Most perniciously, his casual cruelty has suffocated everyone around him. John goes about setting things right. As he restores order, he finds himself becoming intoxicated by the meaning and purpose that he has done without for so long. Johnny\u2019s overflowing life includes a number of beautiful women \u2013 and soon John is falling into bed with mistress Bela and falling in love with his wife Frances. With every day that goes by, John is wound tighter into the other man\u2019s life.\nJust as it seems there is no going back, Johnny returns and sees his \u2018scapegoat\u2019 is rising to the challenge rather than taking the blame as he had planned. The story takes a lethal turn as Johnny uses his perfect alibi to attempt to murder his wife \u2013 and claim her substantial marriage settlement.\nIn the climax, John tracks down his twin to the foundry \u2013 and the two men fight desperately for the one life at stake. Our hero emerges triumphant before incinerating Johnny\u2019s body in the hot ovens.\nJohn returns to discover that Frances will survive, and the house, family and all the trappings of Johnny\u2019s life are his for the taking. The story ends with a glimpse of the family six months later. Everyone is gathering round to watch the new Queen\u2019s coronation, with Frances visibly pregnant.\nWe end on John \u2013 the king is dead, long live the king."

                            "text": "It\u2019s September which evokes memories of apple-themed activities like going back-to-school and learning about Johnny Appleseed. While he seemed like a perfect storybook legend, he was actually a real person and his name was John Chapman. The real story of Johnny Appleseed is a little weirder than anything taught in schools.\nJohnny Appleseed was born John Chapman in 1774 in Leominster, Massachusetts. As a child of the revolution, he grew up with the turmoil of war. His mother died in 1776, but his father Nathaniel Chapman survived The Battle of Bunker Hill as a minute man and several other harrowing battles. After the war, he returned home and taught his son about proper farming.\nAs a young man he ended up going to Pennsylvania where he planted his first apple nursery. Apples are an interesting fruit to plant because apples are actually cloned from one another through a process called grafting. Planting apples simply from seeds does not grow apples the same apples that we love to eat.\nApples that simply grow some seeds produce bitter fruit that are better used for cider which is exactly what Johnny Appleseed was doing. His apples were not meant to be eaten. They were meant to get you drunk!\nJohnny, however, didn\u2019t believe in grafting. So he traveled around carrying a sack full of seeds \u2013 much like he appears in drawings and cartoons! He was an animal rights activist and a vegetarian who preferred to do everything the natural way. Thus he planted seeds and refused to carry his seeds in anything other than a burlap sack.\nHe was a savvy businessman who tried to predict where settlers would go next in the growing Midwest region. He\u2019d attempt to go there first, plant an orchard, and then have apples to sell all over the new frontier once new settlers got there.\nIt was a great plan and it really worked! He had a seasonal routine in which he would return to his old orchards, collect the seeds and sell his apples, and then go off to plant more. He was a true rambling man except that he had a business plan.\nTaking seeds from orchards in Allegheny County in Pennsylvania, he traveled from there to Illinois planting his seeds in exchange for housing. Johnny was legendary in the Midwest for planting his trees in exchange for lodging and a hot meal.\nThis method of getting around \u2013 with no posessions other than a Bible \u2013 gave a lot of people the chance to get to know Johnny who was a religious zealot. His stories spread and soon legends grew. By 1806, he was dubbed \u2018Johnny Appleseed\u2019.\nHe most likely really wore the rags he is often depicted wearing, but that\u2019s due to his devout faith in the teachings of Emanuel Swedenborg. As a member of The New Church, he worshipped nature as he believed everything on earth corresponded directly to a spirit in the afterlife.\nHe believed that his seeds were not merely a business venture, but the word of God. He also refused to ride horses, believing it to be animal cruelty, so he walked and canoed everywhere.\nHe was also very vocally celibate. When asked about marriage he would say that God would provide him a \u201cpure woman\u201d in Heaven, so he didn\u2019t want to waste time marrying someone impure on Earth. Very chill idea! He stayed single, idealizing women as pure angels rather than bothering to get to know real life ones.\nThere were several rumors about his previous love affairs and possible engagements, some claiming he tried to get engaged to girls as young as 8 or 10 to ensure they were pure, but few can be substantiated. There are stories about a broken engagement that he had to a girl named Nancy Tannehill that vary, but ultimately all end in a brokenhearted Johnny.\nHe died at the old age of 70 in 1845 which was double the average life expectancy, so an apple a day really does keep the doctor away. Johnny\u2019s died a wealthy man, with an orchard franchise spanning the nation, despite the fact that he lived like a pauper.\nSadly, many of his orchards were chopped down by the FBI during prohibition in attempts to get the public to stop drinking alcoholic cider. Apple tree growers had to embrace eating apples rather than drinking them to keep their orchards afloat.

                            "text": "A 17th century marriage was more or less a business contract. It was about wealth, titles, patronage, heirs, and if one was a member of a royal house about politics. Everyone involved was aware of it.\nMonsieur had the bliss, he would probably call it misfortune, to be married twice. As brother of the Sun King it was his duty to marry in order to produce heirs to continue his line and to form political alliances. Both of Monsieur\u2019s marriages were political, the first marriage allied France to England, the second smoothed the tensions at the borders along the Rhine. Here we shan\u2019t focus too much about his life as married man, but more on the weddings itself.\nAfter Louis XIV wedded Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se d\u2019Autriche in 1660, the time for his little brother to marry came as well.\nThere was no need to look at distant lands to find a bride, the bride already lived at the French court, but had until May 1660 little importance to anyone. Louis XIV himself did not like her much at all. He found her too thin, a poor relation, a bit too silly and not really attractive enough to wake his own interests. It was Henrietta of England, or as the French called her Henriette d\u2019Angleterre. This Stuart princess spent most of her life thus far at the French court. Her mother was the sister of Louis XIII, her father the deposed Charles I, her brother Charles II a King without a Kingdom\u2026. until 29 May in 1660.\nCharles II claimed his rightful throne and his little sister, which he called Minette, became very interesting. Charles II could use the friendship of Louis XIV, Louis XIV saw a chance to prevent Charles from getting friendly with Spain. He later said in his memoirs \u201cThe marriage of my brother, served to keep Charles on my side.\u201d Both Monarchs favoured the match. So did Mazarin, although he did not like the Stuarts much. Henriette Marie de France, who had hoped her daughter might become Queen of France, was favourable of making her the Second Woman of France at least.\nWhat did bride and groom think? According to Charles II, his sister was \u201cby no means upset over the prospect.\u201d She was sixteen, he was twenty. They knew each other all their lives, without becoming particularly close or forming any kind of friendship, but at least she knew him in person. Unlike other princesses who did see their husband\u2019s for the first time as they were already married to them. Minette was probably aware of the rumours about Monsieur\u2019s sexuality\u2026 but it played not much of a role. The advantages were too great. A own household, a own fortune, sister-in-law to the King, not having to leave France\u2026. being free of a sometimes slightly demanding mother.\nMonsieur was not opposed either. He was eager to establish a own household, where his brother had nothing to say, and to get hold of his appanage. Said appanage would only be gained at marriage. It were the properties, parts of them, that his uncle Gaston de France had possessed and which reverted to the crown after his death. All in all, he was quite eager\u2026. but not because he had much affection for the bride. What enchanted him in the moment and made him court Minette, might have been the prospect of a little freedom to be gained\u2026 and this freedom could not come too fast. Philippe urged his brother to get the whole thing done as quickly as possible.\nOn March 31 in 1661, three years after Monsieur had uttered a desire to wed, the great day finally arrived. It was by far not as glorious as Monsieur had wished for, since the court was in high mourning. Cardinal Mazarin had passed away three weeks earlier. Minette had been ill and had also to recover from the death of two of her siblings, Mary, Princess Royal, and Henry, Duke of Gloucester. Thus only a simple ceremony could be held.\nOn March 30, both made their confessions and witnessed how their marriage contract was signed by Louis XIV, Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se d\u2019Autriche and Henriette Marie de France. On March 31, around noon, both were married in the chapel of Henriette Marie de France in the Palais Royal. Present were their immediate family, la Grande Mademoiselle, the Prince de Cond\u00e9 and a small group of representatives. The following festivities only consisted of a small supper held by Minette\u2019s mother. Bride and groom retired to their quarters at the Tuileries afterwards to perform the great deed\u2026 but it was not possible. \u201cMonsieur le Cardinal\u201d was in the way. It was that time of the month and Philippe not pleased at all. He slammed the doors shut apparently. After \u201cMonsieur le Cardinal\u201d had vanished, another attempt was dared with not much success as well. Apparently Philippe found himself unable to perform in a satisfying way.\nNevertheless all seemed to go well for the first few weeks, until talk of Minette\u2019s flirtings reached his ears. From the very point on, both did their very best to make each others life as difficult as possible. Minette felt wronged by the flirting accusations, Philippe felt betrayed by his wife, his brother, and his lover. The marriage lasted nine years and came to an end due to the surprising death of Minette.\nAfter the sudden demise of the first Madame, as the wife of Monsieur was traditionally called, a second Madame was needed. Louis XIV wasted no time with it. The very obvious choice for him was their cousin, the unmarried Anne-Marie Louise d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans, called la Grande Mademoiselle, but she was not happy about it at all. Talk of such a match already circulated before Monsieur married Minette and while la Grande Mademoiselle was not really opposed to it back in the days, she was now. Mademoiselle was in love, not with Monsieur, but with a certain Duc de Lauzun, who she intended to wed.\nIn the end \u00c9lisabeth-Charlotte du Palatinat was to become to new Madame. She had no large dowry, was not really handsome, very German, but a descendant of Elizabeth Stuart and her father\u2019s territory, along the Rhine, might prove useful in the future. It did. Monsieur appeared not to be moved too much by the prospect of a second marriage, the public observed him showing normal behaviour. It is hard to say what he might have thought about it, but it was certainly clear to him that he need to marry again. He had no male heir yet and one was needed. What might have cheered him, was the fact that this second marriage could be celebrated in style at least.\nAs custom required, a wedding by proxy took place first. \u00c9lisabeth-Charlotte, nicknamed Liselotte, converted from her Protestant faith to the Catholic and was wedded to Monsieur two days later, on November 6 in 1671, in the cath\u00e9drale de Metz. It was a cold day and the bride only dressed in a light gown of blue taffeta. Monsieur and the new Madame did not meet until a few days later. He travelled all the way from Paris, in not much of a haste and stopping often to receive congratulations, to meet his new wife on a road leading from Tilloy-en-Bellay to Ch\u00e2lons. The new Madame was nineteen years old, not much of a looker and of a plump figure. In Ch\u00e2lons, the couple received the blessings, attended mass and witnessed a solemn Te Deum. Feasting and fireworks followed.\nThe following day the couple left for Villers-Cotter\u00eats, the chateau to which Monsieur fled as the Chevalier de Lorraine had been arrested, and there the party continued. More feasting and fireworks, congratulations and salutes, but it was only the hors d\u2019oeuvre to what was to follow in Paris. The streets were crowded as the new Madame made her entrance into the city and she was thus introduced to every one of importance. Ball followed ball, banquet followed banquet. It was one big party lasting all they way through carnival until Lent arrived.\nWe can presume that Monsieur enjoyed this spectacle way more compared to the festivities to celebrate his first marriage. The wedding night seems to have been more successful too. At least there are no hints a certain \u201cMonsieur le Cardinal\u201d interrupted or any of the two were unable to entertain. This second marriage started out very well and remained in such a state for quite a while, never minding Monsieur\u2019s preference for male lovers. Said male lovers were the reason in the end why the marriage became a little turbulent at times. All in all, it was still less troublesome, to Monsieur at least, then the first marriage. As the years passed by, both arranged themselves with the other and could laugh about the funny habits of the other. Madame ignored Monsieur\u2019s moods, Monsieur in turn ignored some of Madame\u2019s German traits. Liselotte outlived her husband and died in 1722 as the mother of the Regent of France.\nThoughts on Versailles season two, episode two\u2026."

                            "text": "The Dreyfus Affair, as it came to be called, began in 1894, when the French military discovered that someone had been passing defence secrets to the Germans. Captain Alfred Dreyfus, a Jew, was arrested for the crime and sentenced to life imprisonment. Over the next few years, as the doubtful evidence was publicly reexamined, France become torn into two opposed and sometimes violent camps: 'Dreyfusards' who believed that he was innocent and had become a scapegoat because he was Jewish, and the frequently anti-Semitic 'anti-Dreyfusards', who refused to contenance any questioning of military justice. The affair was the biggest news story of its time, and, taking place at the same time as the cinema itself was born, it became one of the first major news events to be tackled by the infant film medium, though with varying degrees of accuracy. One filmic representation was outright deception, when Francis Doublier, touring the Jewish districts of Russia in the late 1890s, showed selected shots of buildings and scenery, while a lecturer mendaciously declared them as the very places where Dreyfus had been tried and imprisoned.\nA genuine attempt to record Dreyfus on film took place when the prisoner was brought back from Devil's Island in July 1899 to face a second trial in France. This event, taking place in Rennes, became a great media circus, with scores of journalists and photographers descending on the town. In amongst them was a certain Monsieur Orde, carting a huge Biograph camera around the streets, and, despite the protests of the Dreyfus family, trying to record anything connected with the affair. He managed to film Madame Dreyfus on one of her visits to the prison and, by renting a house across from the prison yard and biding his time, succeeded in obtaining a shot of the prisoner himself on one of his daily walks. The next step in the screen portrayal of Dreyfus was dramatisation, and two film versions of the affair were made in 1899: Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s began work on his one in August, which consisted of some twelve separate scenes, showing Dreyfus (played by an ironworker) from his arrest, through his degradation and imprisonment, to the trial in Rennes. A Path\u00e9 version, in six scenes including the trial, was in production at about the same time, and both were on the market by the autumn of 1899. M\u00e9li\u00e8s was a passionate Dreyfusard, and his portrayal of the prisoner reflects the filmmaker's sympathies, though this was not to everyone's taste: the first screening provoked fighting between pro- and anti-Dreyfusards, and M\u00e9li\u00e8s' version was apparently banned by the French government, the first instance of film censorship for political reasons. A restriction on showing films about the Dreyfus affair was only lifted in 1950. The affair had clearly demonstrated, even in this very early period, that the cinema could tackle burning contemporary events in both factual and dramatised formats."

Though it may feel silly, you\u2019ll be tempted to turn around and make sure you\u2019re still on 6th street. That you didn\u2019t just step through a magical portal. Because inside this unassuming little sandwich shop in the heart of downtown LA, it looks a whole lot like Paris. It smells like Paris. And if you listen closely, it even sounds like Paris.\nThe place is small but the details that emulate the city are distinct. There are fresh pastries and baguette sandwiches displayed on the counter, small wood tables crammed along the walls, and a stack of french magazines sitting on a shelf. The flower vases and pots are charming in their incongruence and the old copper tea pot by the window gives the impression of a personal souvenir. You may feel like you\u2019ve just stepped into a Parisian apartment, belonging to a host with very good taste.\nBut before all that, you\u2019ll surely notice the striking smell. Or accumulation of smells, that one might imagine wafting through a Parisian caf\u00e9. The irresistible aroma of freshly ground coffee, the seductive scent of melting butter, the comforting whiff of toasting bread.\nAnd if you stop and listen to the chatter in the kitchen, you\u2019ll probably hear a bit of French too. It\u2019s not just the greeting of \u201cBonjour\u201d from behind the counter but it\u2019s the rapid conversations between Alison Barber, Kerian Jarry, and Sophie Clerico, the family team that owns the shop. Like many Parisians natives, their English is close to perfect, but it\u2019s a treat to hear them converse in French.\nWhile we\u2019re sure you\u2019ll be tempted by a pastry or two, the cannel\u00e9 and kougin-amman are must tries, this week\u2019s OTM item from Madame Monsieur is the mini truffle croque madame, a decadent french classic that won\u2019t disappoint. The sandwich is rich, with more than one layer of cheese, but don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s mini, so you\u2019ll have room for those desserts.\nTo learn more about this adorable croque madame and about the madames and monsieur behind Madame Monsieur, we sat down with owner and chief creative officer, Kerian Jarry.\nWhy the Mini Truffle Croque Madame as your Off the Menu item?\nOur place is called Madame Monsieur because the croque madame and croque monsieur are our flagship products. But we\u2019ve been established for two years now, so we wanted to create a new concept of the croque madame and have a little fun with the original idea. The inspiration for the small size came from a trip to the market, where we go every weekend. We saw tiny quail eggs and we wanted to do something with them. We then decided to add truffle oil to the sandwich to give it a little twist and make it truly different form our regular croque madame that we serve everyday in-house.\nWhere did you learn to make a croque monsieur?\nThis is a family business and we are all from Paris, so I think we learned just from eating the sandwiches all the time. The croque monsieur and croque madame are the common sandwiches that you eat for lunch in Paris, so we knew what it tasted like and how we wanted it to taste. Also Alison has been trained in a Michelin star restaurant so she has more of a restaurant background. When we came here, we had to find how to make it taste the same as it does in France, so we import the cured ham and the dijon mustard. It\u2019s a simple dish, but it is only good if you have good ingredients.\nWhat\u2019s the most important step or component to making a good Truffle Croque Madame?\nA good friend of mine is a very talented chef in Paris and he suggested using cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche instead of b\u00e9chamel to make the sandwich lighter. That\u2019s our special secret ingredient. But the steps to making the sandwich are easy. First we have two slices of pullman bread, the fresher the better. Then we add creme fra\u00eeche, dijon mustard, cured ham, swiss cheese, salt and pepper. Then we close it, put a little butter of course, creme fra\u00eeche again, and then swiss cheese. This extra layer of cheese is important. I think we were often disappointed with the croque monsieur when we first came here because most of them were missing this last layer of caramelized cheese on top. They were more like paninis. For the croque madame, we then fry an egg on the side and put it on top at the last second.\nWhich side dish on the menu pairs best with the Truffle Croque Madame?\nWe serve the truffle croque madame with a side of micro greens topped with olive oil and a homemade fig glaze.\nWhat else would you recommend that an OTM member orders?\nOur other sandwich that we are famous for is the ham and butter. It is made on a very good baguette, which we call a retro baguette, because it is done in the old style and the time it takes for it to cook is much longer than a regular baguette. It is very airy, chewy, yet crunchy at the same time. So the ham butter sandwich is just the retro baguette, butter, ham, and cornichon. It is very simple but that\u2019s the secret.\nOur coffee is also very good. We are now working with Suits & Knives. They have a Japanese technique of roasting their beans that provide a great balance of flavors, with citrusy yet chocolatey notes.\nDo you make your pastries in house?\nNo, we have a commissary, so we do make them but not in-house. We work very closely with BreadBar, one of the oldest artisan houses for pastry in L.A. If you come here for a pastry, you come here for the kouign amann, which is made with croissant dough and sugar.\nDo you create new sandwich recipes often?\nEvery season, we come up with new sandwich recipes for each of our different types of breads. Right now, for example, we have a wasabi tuna for the mini pullman sandwich, we have roast beef and mango chutney with a remoulade sauce for the toasted baguette, and for the retro baguette, we\u2019re doing a vegan sandwich. For our seasonal sandwiches, we try to add a twist that you wouldn't find in France and is inspired by our surroundings.\nWill you guys be expanding Madame Monsieur anytime soon?\nWe are actually trying to expand in a different way. Right now, we are launching a new line of sandwiches. The concept came from being tired of the airport triangle sandwiches that taste bad and cost a fortune, so we designed our own packaged sandwiches with artisanal bread and fresh products. Each sandwich has its own packaging, like you would see in the chocolate industry. The idea is to work with coffee shops or locations that don\u2019t have kitchens but want to sell quality products to compliment their coffee."

Molasses and sticky toffee pudding highlight the ex-oloroso influence, but sweetness levels are not through the roof here \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of coastal impact \u2013 rock pools, pebbles and fresh fish. Smoke is certainly present, but it too plays second fiddle to the seaside profile \u2013 it\u2019s rather reminiscence of the end of a firework display, blue touch paper and saltpeter thick in the air. Herbalness also has a part to play here with both pine needles and tree sap in play. The addition of water really brings the brine in this whisky to the fore, as well as adding in aromas of leather satchels and slightly yeasty bread. All rather fascinating.\nTaste: A very meat-driven no.29 \u2013 salt beef sandwiches with a side of roasted vegetables and gravy for dipping. Again, juxtapositioned by sweeter flavours \u2013 honey, freshly baked sponge cakes and golden syrup. The smoke presence is exceedingly well integrated and comes across more as BBQ\u2019d meats and burnt sugars than the expected TCP and surface cleaner. Water adds an incredible amount of savoury and umami flavours into the equation \u2013 ham hock, beef stock, sliced cold cuts all seasoned with herbs and pine. This doesn\u2019t sound like it should work, but it does.\nFinish: Long, slightly salty and coastal and combined with a selection of smoked meats.\nOccasionally you turn up a Laphroaig that is fundamentally different to the acknowledged distillery style \u2013 this is one of those. It\u2019s all rather left-field. Meaty yet coastal, herbal yet sweet. I need to try this one again \u2013 it\u2019s a real thinker. Altered, idiosyncratic and pretty stimulating. Recommended."

At the front of the church was a large picture of the man for whom we had all come to pay our respects and say our goodbyes.\nThere were several familiar faces and many I did not know. Some carried on animated exchanges while others sat and prepared for the tears they knew were coming. The church fell silent and we all rose to greet his wife, his children, his grandchildren and his extended family.\nDuring the service, his children got up to share their memories of their dad and through broken, emotion-soaked voices they gave us another look into the man we all knew and greatly respected. Before they even spoke, I saw the pain in their faces. That same pain had been etched into my skin years ago when I lost my parents, my dad in 2006 and my mom, more recently, in 2014. It is a pain not easily described to those who have not lost a parent.\nAlthough both of my parents were ill leading up to their passing, they both left before I had a chance to say I love you once more because we thought we had more time. This poor family thought they had much more time but their dad died very unexpectedly of a massive heart attack. I sat through the service with dry eyes, because to have cried one tear would have opened floodgates that may not have closed.\nI sit now writing this post through the tears that I could not shed on Saturday for fear they would not stop. I think of all the lives he changed for the better. I think of his countless hours spent doing things for those less fortunate. I think of the legacy he left behind for us to follow. And I think of his children who thought they had more time with their dad but never had the chance to tell him \u201cI love you\u201d just one more time.\nAs someone so astutely pointed out to me on Saturday, we are all given numbers and we never know when ours will be called. Love deeply, laugh abundantly, share your good fortune with those who go without and don\u2019t ever take for granted the moments to tell the people in your life how you feel about them. You never know when their, or your, number will be called.\n\u2190 I have no words to compare to this\u2026..\nThis is so very true for all of us.The older we get, the more we realize how little time we have left.\nAnd it seems to go by so fast."

At 14, Harry worked in his school holidays as an apprentice in a small but respected boutique jeweller. A passion was ignited. Upon completing his school education at 16, he began his trade as a jeweller, honing his skills as he laboured to master his craft.\nFor Zorro, his journey into fine jewellery started even earlier. At just 10, he was learning the craft alongside his brother and by 12, he left school to begin his jewellery apprenticeship. For both sons, the craft of jeweller was a necessity to support the family; but it was also a hallowed passion that was etched deeply into their souls. They learnt how to identify the very finest diamonds and gemstones; how to select the highest quality materials; and how to design and carefully craft a unique and exquisite piece of jewellery, worthy of the occasion it represents.\nIn 1973, the family immigrated to Australia. Inspired to bring their passion for quality craftsmanship to their new country, their skills were quickly noticed in Sydney; Harry now as a respected master jeweller and Zorro, being awarded \u2018Apprentice Of The Year\u2019 in 1974 by the pre-eminent jeweller in Australia of the time.\nThe Keverian brothers began trading from a small workshop in the Trust Building in Sydney\u2019s King Street in 1975. As wholesale jewellers, they designed and crafted fine jewellery for some of the most coveted brands in Australia and around the world. Their passion, dedication and personal approach saw Bond Street Jewellers become one of Australia\u2019s most trusted names in fine jewellery.\nOver the years, the passion and the craft has been handed from generation to generation, with Harry and Zorro\u2019s children working in the business today. As the business grew, Harry and Zorro established their beautiful studio and workshop at its current location at Archer Street, Chatswood, one of a handful of remaining diamond and gemstone jewellery manufacturers in Australia. Now, driven by a desire to bring the exquisite fine jewellery direct to their customers, Harry and Zorro have opened their doors as a retail business, offering their knowledge, experience and expertise to anyone who wants to mark a special milestone in their life.\nToday, master jewellers Harry and Zorro guide a team in their Chatswood workshop, and still meet personally with clients in the studio. As creative director, Zorro\u2019s daughter Natalie manages the retail and wholesale operations along with the creative direction of the business.\nFrom the classic to the contemporary, from the fashionable to the timeless, Bond Street Jewellers create one-of-a-kind fine jewellery that will be treasured for generations."

                            "text": "SSPX Priest on Amoris Laetitia: How to disguise falsehood under the mantle of truth?\nOn the March 19, 2016, Pope Francis' post-synodal Apostolic Exhortation Amoris Laetitia on love in the family was published. Why speak of this pontifical document in a publication devoted to the spirituality of Saint Louis-Marie de Montfort? Because Father de Montfort casts a singular light on the problematic posed by this document.\nTo begin with, a little reminder. The leitmotif or the thrust of the Second Vatican Council was aggiornamento, or in Latin accomodatio renovata, that is, opening and adaptation to the modern world. Paul VI explained the meaning of this term in his opening speech to the second session (1963): \u201cthat the deposit of Christian doctrine be conserved and presented in a more efficacious manner\u201d and that doctrine \u201cbe deepened and expressed following the research methods and presentation used by modern thought\u201d.\nSimply put, it was, therefore, a case of marrying Catholic doctrine with the Atheism, Evolutionism, Modernism, Liberalism and immorality of the modern world. And herein lies the basic problem: how can you express Divine Revelation, that is, Catholic Faith and Morals, using the thought of today's world? Strictly speaking, it is a case of trying to square the circle.\nNow, to use terminology more proper to Saint Louis-Marie de Montfort, the problem of the Second Vatican Council was that of marrying Divine Wisdom with the wisdom of the world. Saint Louis Marie de Montfort dealt with this subject in The Love of Eternal Wisdom in Numbers 74 to 89. Father de Montfort explains that the world \u201csubtly [uses] the truth to inspire falsehood, virtue to authorize sin, and the very maxims of Jesus Christ to authorize its own\u201d (Number 79).\nFather Grignon also points out that worldly wisdom is \u201ca perfect conformity with the maxims and fashions of the world... not in a clumsy and blatant way, by committing some scandalous sin, but in a subtle, deceptive and political manner; otherwise it would no longer be wisdom in the eyes of the world, but license\u201d (Number 75).\nFinally, he defines the worldly person as someone \u201cwho makes a secret but deadly agreement between truth and falsehood, between the Gospel and the world, between virtue and sin\u201d (Number 76). De Montfort is here describing Liberal Catholicism (which ended up triumphing at Vatican II and in its reforms) a full one hundred years before its existence (19th Century).\nWhat does Amoris Laetitia contain? A reminder of the doctrine of the indissolubility of marriage (in Numbers 52-53, 62, 77, 86, 123 and 178) and, at the same time, affirmations which grant divorced and remarried people the possibility of accessing the sacraments, that is to say Confession and Communion, without conversion, without contrition, without reparation for scandal, without ceasing to live in adultery and without ceasing their sin (in Numbers 243, 298-299, 301-305 and especially Note 351).\nTo be convinced of this, the reader can refer to two easily accessible publications: DICI Number 345 of November 25 2016 and Le Courrier de Rome Number 595 of January 2017.\nDe Montfort, with his eagle eye, saw the crux of the problem which currently occupies our attention: Conciliar wisdom consists in disguising falsehood under the mantle of truth, and vice under that of virtue. Thus, Amoris Laetitia, authorizes sacrilege under the pretext of being pastoral. Let it be said in passing that there is a good chance that the 2018 Synod will carry out the same sleight of hand with regard to ecclesiastical celibacy in order to permit the priestly ordination of married men.\nDe Montfort was truly a man in advance of his own time. This is so because he held to Catholic Doctrine, that of the Council of Trent, which in turn reiterates that of Saint Thomas Aquinas. In effect, history teaches us that, during this Council, two books were placed on the altar: The Bible or Sacred Scripture (Written Tradition) and the Summa Theologica of Saint Thomas Aquinas (representing Oral Tradition).\nAnd in those days, this Catholic Doctrine was not expressed with the help of an atheistic philosophy which is opposed to the Catholic Faith, but with the help of sane Aristotelian-Thomistic philosophy, known as the Philosophia Perennis, and which is \u201cthe Handmaid of Theology\u201d (Saint Thomas Aquinas)."

I suppose that is why they had the best seat in the whole room.\nAs a historian, you\u2019ll get to know about some really powerful people. Simon De Montfort was a powerful man who inherited Leicester Castle and became the 6th Earl of Leicester in 1208. Simon De Montfort did a lot of building work on the castle. He improved a lot of the buildings and made them bigger. In 1264 Simon De Montfort led the Barons\u2019 rebellion. He defeated King Henry III to become the uncrowned King Of England.\nDid you know? During his rule, Simon De Montfort called the first directly elected parliament in medieval Europe. That means that he helped to set up the way that our country and many others are still run today. There are still quite a lot of things around Leicester that use De Montfort\u2019s name. Have you heard of De Montfort University? Or De Montfort Hall? As a historian you\u2019ll have to remember a lot facts and figures. A good memory is essential."

Glimmering lights adorned every window, and the muffled sound of a Christmas song was carried on the wind.\nProtect Your ValuablesWho Sent the Ants?"

                            "text": "Today is the final installment of our serial story, A Month Of Expectation. You can find the beginning here.\nThe storybook framework of Emma's carefully constructed future crumbled like a tired Vegas casino in the hands of a demolition crew. She turned away, sickened by the image of her beloved sister and fiance in a romantic--and obviously familiar--embrace.\nHer mother's foreboding words rumbled through Emma's soul like thunder. You need to expect that things may not go quite as you planned.\nEmma grasped the banister with one hand and began to make her way down the fifteen flights of stairs. Why hadn't one of them said something to her? Had they played her for a fool all along?\nThe hollow, empty ring of her footsteps on the concrete stairs echoed in her heart and chased her home to a tormenting refrain: What you sow, you shall also reap. If anyone deserved to reap the bitter flavor of betrayal it was Emma, and she knew it.\nShe closed her eyes when her head touched the pillow only to have them snap open and stare into the darkness. Reason and logic warred with conscience and conviction. Reason said, \u201cstay the course.\u201d What did it matter that Thad and Jenny had once been involved with each other? No one ever had to know she'd seen Jenny and Thad together. She and Thad could get married just as she'd spent all these months carefully planning. Thad was right for her, and she was right for him. Their families approved of the marriage. Every detail was in place, from the seed pearls on her gown to the virginal white satin peignoir set wrapped in tissue and packed in her bridal luggage set.\nEmma took a deep breath and released it. Then, for the umpteenth time, she waited for the inner peace that should follow the right decision. But peace wouldn't come. She balled her fists into the eiderdown comforter in frustration.\nEmma had dreamed of her storybook wedding for years, just waiting to paint the groom's face into her mental picture. The innumerable preparations she'd made were more real to her than the marriage that would follow the vows. In her mind's eye, everything she'd planned was perfect.\nBut Emma couldn't ignore the pesky irritation coming from her conscience and the soft nudging she'd come to recognize as the conviction of the Holy Spirit. In her brief experience with God, she knew His plans outweighed anything she could arrange for herself, but was she willing to let go of the dreamy vision she'd created for her wedding day -- and for her life?\nThe alarm bleeped just as the first beams of sunlight pierced the window. Emma turned her face into the light. Had she slept at all?\n\u201cLord, grant me the strength I need to do what's right in Your sight,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI've tried to create my own plan, instead of trusting Your plans for me, Lord. Forgive me, and help me to trust that You alone know what is best for me.\u201d Even as she whispered the final words, a gentle warmth poured through her soul like melted chocolate, providing sweetness and light for the difficult day ahead.\nShe threw on jeans and a T-shirt instead of the white velour \u201cbride-to-be\u201d jogging suit she'd laid out, snatched up her car keys, and headed out the door.\nAlthough the day was warm, she kept the top on the convertible up. The part of town she'd be visiting wasn't the kind of place you left your doors unlocked or your car parked by the curb. But today she didn't have much choice.\nShe shoehorned the car into a space in front of a rambling brick warehouse. The kind people remodel into multi-million dollar lofts--except this one was in its original state of disrepair. With her lips set in a determined line, Emma stepped around a pile of dog excrement and marched to the door. She pushed the buzzer and planted her feet, lest she lose her nerve. The toe of her sneaker rapped the concrete with nervous impatience. What if he wasn't here?\nJust when she was ready to whirl and run, the heavy steel door jerked open. The melted chocolate feeling she'd experienced earlier rushed back with the force of a flash flood so intense it weakened her knees. Remy.\nDark hair curled past his tanned face and fell in waves past his shoulders, creating a stark contrast to the wrinkled white T-shirt that clung to his lean form. Bare feet stuck out below the ragged hems of worn blue jeans. His eyes, gray like a dove's wing, widened. He opened his mouth, but Emma held a finger to his lips. If he said anything at all, she'd lose her nerve.\nHe blinked, but held her gaze as he grasped her fingers and pressed a gentle kiss on the sensitive inside of her wrist.\nEmma snatched her hand away and shoved it in her back pocket.\n\u201cI thought I just did,\u201d he replied.\nHis voice resonated all the way to the marrow of her bones and shot an involuntary shudder down her spine.\nThe bitterness was only evident in his eyes for a flash. He scrubbed a hand against his unshaven cheek and she wondered at the rough, red places on his knuckles.\n\u201cI can't marry Thad.\u201d There, she'd said it. He cocked his head toward her.\nAn expression of sheer delight washed over his face. Emma thought he might start to glow.\nEmma cringed. He'd known all along the things that had kept her from giving him what he'd wanted most--her love. \u201cYes.\u201d She dropped her gaze to his bare toes. What if he'd changed his mind? She sensed his movement and opened her eyes to find him down on one knee.\nShe flung her arms around his neck, knocking him backward. They rolled together onto the grubby linoleum and poured years of unspent passion into a kiss that should have left burn marks. Remy pulled them to a sitting position.\nDo you think Emma is on the rebound?\nIf you were Remy would you be willing to take her back?\nwasn't expecting that. now i like Emma a whole lot better. good for her to realize her best laid plans were mere dust to what the Lord apparently has planned for her.\ninteresting that both Emma and Thad left people they loved because they couldn't handle God's call their loved ones followed.\nboth Thad and Emma return to their true loves and walk in God's plan?? that WOULD be a HEA.\nMaybe everybody needs to take a little time and reevaluate.\nI forgot how much fun it was to do these serial stories. We should do more.\nThe funny thing is that we kind of all just ran with the ball... no one knew how it was going to turn out, especially me. Kind of scary to be the anchor on the relay!\nYeah, Niki threw in an amazing twist at the end. Love the ending and love, love Remy, sigh.\nAnd I have to say, as the person who started the story, Niki took it to the perfect place and yet one I wouldn't have expected.\nyes, i agree. let's do tis again. We honestly just ran with it. Wrote it in order and handed it forward. (once done, we all read it through but we barely had any changes or tweaking."

When it stopped being about frantic groping in his bunk, or hers\u2014hoping Mal couldn't hear them. Knowing he had, and not caring. When it became more than making sure there was a plate of dinner left for him, when it looked like Jayne would go for thirds before he even got to the table. When she stopped being embarrassed when she woke with tears still wet on her cheeks, and instead welcomed his arms around her, his whispered assurances against his neck.\nIt happened slow. Gradually. Until she couldn't imagine a day going by when he didn't make her laugh. When the petty spats hurt more because she was gripped by the fear that maybe this one would be the last one. Maybe she would drive him away. Maybe this relationship came with an expiration date, and she should just enjoy it while it lasted because all good things end. When she realised she dreaded the ending so much that in-between fighting dirty, their love-making acquired a frantic edge. Like she had to store up on all those smiles, and sunlight, and laughter while she could.\nOnce she knew, then there was that free-fall feeling, deep in the pit of her stomach, as she wondered if maybe it as all her. She was living a fantasy in her own mind, and maybe something broke in her during the war that couldn't ever be fixed and she was a fool for trying. For using him. For letting him use her. Fooling herself into believing that she could be so lucky. That the gods of fortune could smile on her after all she'd done. After all she'd killed. After all that time she'd wasted.\nOnce she knew, it was like slow agony. Everything he said suddenly had double, even triple meanings. She drove herself to distraction, trying to sort it all out. Suss out how to be the sort of woman a man like him would want for more than just the night, or to watch his back in a fight, should it come to that. Days and weeks and months of feeling like a child again, uncertain of everything, the constant highs and lows that she hid behind a cold exterior because she was afraid that weakness would drive him away. That he could see how much she needed. How needy she had become.\nShe finally told him\u2014as casual as she could make it sound, couching the shattering confession in a kiss against his neck and murmured words as they rolled away from one another in the darkness. Told him and waited, trying to pretend what he did next didn't matter. That it wouldn't change how she felt about him. That life would go on just like it had before she'd let the genie out of the bottle.\nShe hadn't been prepared for what happened next. The girl who was always prepared for any eventuality. Always wore the vest to stop the bullet. Always had the knife and boot gun in case the sawed-off jammed. Always knew what the Captain was gonna say before he said it. It had taken her completely by surprise.\nWhen Wash kissed her like it was the first time, and told him he loved her a thousand times in the space of a minute and meant it every single breath, the clock had started ticking again and life hadn't gone on just the way it had before."

She was too full of strong emotions to go after him and ask more. She was shocked, confused, embarrassed and even sad.\nShe continued to stare at the spot where Hawkeye had disappeared into the Hurst. After a long moment MudSpatter whuffled and nudged her elbow. The cold nose brought her around to real world. She tried to clear her head with a small shake, but those words clung to the edges of her mind. She buried her fingers into the wolf's ruff and gave him a loving scratch. The speckled wolf tilted his head to let her know he was enjoying that.\nThe shriek of hawk's crying drew her green eyes to the sky above. The morning star was just starting to touch the sky and a pair of proud hawks had taken to the skies to greet her. However, they didn't only greet her they danced for her as well. It didn't take Goldstar long to realize there was a courtship going on above her head. One hawk soared upon thermals of warming air, moving higher into the sky. The dawning light cast a red glow upon golden feathers. The other hawk, looking just as glorious winged his way even higher into the sky, only to flatten his wings and dive for it's companion. Just as his decent took it past the other, it flared its wings, causing it to swing upside down in mid air. This had to be the male, his talons grasped those of the other and the pair, wings stretched wide spiraled out of the sky. The fall only lasted a few heart beats before the parted. Together the pair flew off to find a branch somewhere.\nThe display brought an admiring, yet sad sigh from her lips. Recognition with Talon had been so much like that. Just like those hawks, when her and Talon's souls met.... Oh what a feeling.... It was like falling. Such ecstasy as you spiral out of control into the arms of such a primal need. She often wondered to herself after Talon's death, if she'd ever know that feeling again. How could you love another after having such an experience?"

                            "text": "Spoilers: For the Pilot episode.\nSummary: Falling for a boy she couldn't have was never part of Rachel Berry's Master Plan.\nNotes: The lyrics are taken from the song \"I'm Not That Girl\" from the musical Wicked. Cross-posted in a million different places - I apologize if this ends up on your friends page five times!\nRachel Berry didn't believe in crushes.\nWhen you're already 16 and you haven't been discovered yet, you don't have time for crushes. The clock is ticking, and every minute spent on something that isn't part of your Master Plan to be on Broadway the day after high school graduation at the very latest (while simultaneously attending Juilliard, of course - furthering one's education was key to longevity for a real artist) is another minute wasted. Ambition ruled all; there was no time for feeling sorry for yourself because you had no real friends at school and the Cheerios went out of their way to make your daily life a living hell. With every titter as she passed them in the hallways, with every nasty remark left on her MySpace, with every icy, neon-coloured slushie tossed in her face, she'd learned to grit her teeth and repeat her mantra over and over again in her head as she tried not to cry - When I'm famous, they'll all be begging for my autograph! It worked, because she truly believed it. She had to.\nGlee was part of the Master Plan, of course. It was the only place at school where she felt remotely safe, where she felt a little bit like she actually belonged. Mr. Schue understood Ambition; he was trying his best to help her get what she wanted. (She'd considered, at first, a crush on him, but she'd quickly vetoed the idea and wrestled her mind back in line. A crush on a teacher was so clich\u00e9d, so Mr. Holland's Opus, and it just wouldn't be practical. Besides, she really didn't have the time.) There was room for romance in the Master Plan, but it wasn't supposed to happen like this. The way she'd planned it, it would've happened when she was an ensemble member in her first Broadway show. She'd fall for the leading man and love him from afar, thinking he'd never notice a lowly chorus member... but then one day, she'd be singing alone on the stage after everyone else had left rehearsal, and he'd hear her as he was leaving the theatre. He'd be struck by her pitch-perfect voice and stop to see who was singing, and after he introduced himself that day, they'd strike up a friendship. When one of the understudies for the female lead dropped out of the show, he'd casually recommend her to the director as a replacement, and by the end of the year, she'd have climbed the ranks to become his leading lady both on and off stage. That was how things were supposed to work. Crushing on a football player-turned-singer who barely knew what a musical was was definitely not part of the Master Plan.\nShe knew that she shouldn't let him affect her mood this much, shouldn't let him matter this much, but somehow, she'd let Finn Hudson waltz into her life and very quickly begin poking giant holes in her once ironclad Master Plan. She kept telling herself he didn't matter, kept reminding herself that really, she barely knew him, but that was the thing - the fact that she had to remind herself at all was a pretty big problem. She didn't have time for these constant reminders, and she definitely didn't have time to think about him constantly, the way she'd found herself doing lately. She didn't like the way his presence threw her focus completely off balance; she didn't like suddenly feeling nervous and anxious - her, Rachel Berry, heart-flutteringly nervous! - every time she walked into a Glee rehearsal, knowing he'd be there. She didn't believe in crushes. This was not supposed to happen!\nBut she didn't know how to stop it, because for the first time in her life, she'd run into something she didn't know how to control. She can't fix it with a plan or a list; she can't fix it with practice or study or diligence. Her heart and mind aren't working in the orderly way they usually did, and the loss of control scares her.\nThey're like sparks, the moments she's had with him, little specks of electricity that flared up unexpectedly and burned out bright and fast. There was warmth in the moments, and a strangely consuming joy, but they all went by so fast that sometimes, she can't even remember everything that was said and done. Hold on, her mind says, hold on to the moment, but the moments fade away into a diffused glow and then burn out completely, leaving her grey.\nFor some reason, he makes her happy. He smiles and she wants to keep that smile with her for so much longer than it lasts; his eyes catch hers and she thinks, They're shining, and she feels like the biggest cheeseball in the world, but it's true. It's true. And she wants more of that, and she wants more than that, but she scolds herself mercilessly for wanting what she can't have.\nShe can't have this boy, because he's taken. He's taken by someone who lives in his world, and she knows that she doesn't; not really. His real world is football and cheerleaders, parties and popularity; Glee was still the semi-embarrassing secret life that lurked in his dark corners. But he smiles at her anyhow, and goes out of his way to talk to her at rehearsals, and sometimes she wonders, Why me? She didn't usually lack self-esteem, but his world was full of blonde cheerleaders with perky ponytails, and she knows that's not her. That'll never be her. And then she wonders if it would make a difference if that was her, if she could be a little less this and a little more that. She hates herself for thinking it, because it's so, so ridiculous - to even think about wanting to be more like those brainless, self-absorbed ditzes - such a girl thought she'd never thought she'd have, but it's there.\nShe should hate him for it, for inadvertently being the one to plant such a stupid, un-Rachel-Berry-like thought in her head, but she doesn't. She could never hate him. Her, yes - she hates Quinn Fabray far more than she should - but not him. Never him.\nThere was clearly only one thing she could do, and that was to get over him. Be friendly, be professional, but be done with this crush nonsense, because nothing good could ever come of it. There was no point wasting time she didn't have on someone that would never be hers. There was no point dreaming about could bes and could have beens... no point thinking about the last words he'd said to her, the last time he'd smiled. There was no point anticipating the next time she'd see him, no point in wondering what he'd say next. There was no point lying awake at night, thinking about him; no point wondering what it meant that he'd been consistently showing up in her dreams.\nThere was no point to any of it, because for every time he smiled at her and momentarily filled her world with joy, there were multiple times when she'd remember that smile and hurt so badly that she forgot how to breathe... because when she walked down the hall, she wasn't walking with him. He was with Quinn, and she was tossing her perfectly-curled ponytail and wrapping her arms around his neck, kissing him in front of everyone because she could. It didn't matter to him that she was nasty and shallow. It didn't matter to him that Quinn struggled to keep her head above water in classes Rachel coasted through confidently, didn't matter that she wouldn't know a thing about what was going on in the world outside of Lima. Quinn was his girlfriend, and she was... what? Not even his friend, yet. His choirmate. His fellow Glee Club member. Someone he thought about when she was there, and forgot about when she wasn't.\nRachel Berry didn't believe in crushes, but somehow, she'd found herself deeply in the midst of one, and didn't know what to do.\nVery incisive and understanding of Rachel's mindset. And a very well-written portrayal of it! :D Great, great, great job!"

Perhaps it\u2019s the subtle, inviting coffee scent that perfumes the air or the barely audible alternative music that sings in the background. Maybe it\u2019s the eclectic combination of materials present in the makeup of the shop \u2013 metal, wood, exposed brick and pipes \u2013 or maybe it\u2019s the comic pop-art-esque pieces that adorn the walls as decoration that evoke memories of childhood nostalgia. Whatever it is \u2013 there\u2019s nothing commercial feeling about The Crafted Kup. Instead, walking in (even as a first-time customer) seems more like visiting a home-away-from-home, a place of tranquility.\nAccording to Crafted Kup team member Julia Farese, who has been employed at the store for \u201cfive or six months,\u201d the look of the shop was a very conscientious decision. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked very hard on the aesthetic,\u201d she says.\nThe space itself, situated on Raymond Avenue, seems to inherently lend itself to a coffee shop; walking in, customers first purchase their coffee and then may walk up a small flight of steps to a lofted landing where tables and chairs are situated in several dining rooms. Each of these rooms have slightly varying d\u00e9cor; the establishment itself is a splattering of different types of furniture, lighting, and styles of decoration that somehow cumulates perfectly, resulting in a shop that is loaded with character and can best be described as perfectly imperfect.\nNothing in the space is overwhelming, however, from the pale ocean blue walls that connect all of the dining rooms together, to the dim lighting. If it wasn\u2019t for the occasional hiss of the espresso machine and the sound of chatter from strangers\u2019 quiet exchanges, a customer could easily forget they are in public at all. And despite the fact that the Crafted Kup is obviously a local hot-spot for individuals of all ages to work on assignments, draft emails, and read in a comfortable setting while enjoying a tasteful cup of coffee, the place doesn\u2019t have an underlying frantic energy to it.\nOne of the dining rooms in the Crafted Kup.\nA two-minute drive from Vassar College and a slightly further drive for Marist College students, Farese states that she does see a lot of repeat customers, which she declares is her favorite part of her job.\nVassar College student Lizzie Snyder is a loyal customer and loves the shop due to its winning combination of quality coffee, the distinctive, home-grown atmosphere that simply cannot be achieved at a chain coffee store, and the kind people that work there."

It's Coffitivity.\nBring the clanking of metal spoons to saucers, hear the whirl of espresso makers, and the chatter of strangers. It's the perfect instant atmosphere without paying $3.25 for a small coffee. (At home, I can make 10 cups of coffee for approximately $1.25, including the almond milk for lattes. Coffee shops never carry almond milk anyway, at least in my Southern California experiences.) I can bring the urban hipster love to the woods now. Check it!"

Coffee brewing in two pots.\nI need a cup of coffee, black. It\u2019s been a long two weeks. The table is sticky.\nA road trip. Seven hundred miles, each way. A good old country Bar-b-que, a rehearsal dinner, a wedding, a reception, a day at the horse races. We\u2019re were in Kentucky.\nThen a solid week of keeping a two year old grand-daughter.\nHad to cut about six acres of grass. Not once but twice. Cut it when we got there. Cut it again before we left. Ticks, redbugs, spiders and cockleburs. Grand-daughters!\nI retired to do this?\nSo, I\u2019m sitting in a booth in the corner. My favorite spot. There\u2019s a husband and wife two booths away. They\u2019re eating breakfast, drinking ice water. Neither one says a word to the other. Just busy with fork and knife.\nI\u2019m alone, with pen, paper and my thoughts.\nI see an old high school classmate. He\u2019s one of those whose life should have been a bed of roses. Easy, clear roads and good paths to follow. His life should have turned out right. He turned left too many times. He hit potholes that tore his world apart.\nNext to me, sitting on a stool is an overweight woman.\nShe wears a Wal-Mart uniform, blue over khaki. Her thumbs are going ninety to nothing, driving a cell-phone. Someone else is wide awake at 6:30 and they\u2019re not here. The \u201cI just got off work\u201d look is in her eyes, etched in her face. I imagine she\u2019s been stacking Kleenex, paper towels and baby diapers since midnight. She\u2019s not ready to go home.\nTwo or three others walk in. There\u2019s a man wearing a Branson T-shirt and a camouflage ball cap. He\u2019s drinking orange juice. He\u2019s closer to my age than anyone else at the counter. He turns and looks every time the door opens. I like my corner.\nI\u2019m nursing my second cup of coffee.\nA man and his son walk in. The kid is wearing a t-shirt jersey with a number on the back and a business name on the front. He\u2019s shaking his head about breakfast. His Dad orders the ham and grits. The kid drinks a coke.\nThere\u2019s another couple, dressed for church or a funeral. He\u2019s got his coat and tie. She\u2019s in her Sunday best. As they walk in, he holds the door. They\u2019re close to social security age also.\nThey look around. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve been here before. They take another booth. Order big breakfast platters.\nBy now, I\u2019m on my third cup of coffee. The waitress has been up all night, too. I think she wants to go home. She doesn\u2019t call me \u2018darling.\u2019 That\u2019s a first at the Waffle House."

A number of canvases on the wall told stories through a riot of colors that pierced the monotony like the first rays of the rising sun.\nAn array of chairs and tables, lamps hanging from the ceiling, and a long, granite counter held mouth-watering culinary assortments behind a glass shelf which held her attention but only for a fleeting moment.\nThere were handful of people in the room \u2013 a man who nursed a lone cup of coffee, which was his only companion, a couple who sat with their fingers entwined but their thoughts seemed to be far away from each other, an elderly couple who playfully bickered over the last bite of chocolate cake while sharing a steaming cup of tea. But in midst of this she sat alone on a table surrounded by books, a bottle of water, a cup of tea, papers with words scrawled all over them, a few memories, and regrets. She didn\u2019t seem to belong there.\nThe kohl-rimmed eyes had a haunted look to them, which only magnified the grief reflected on her face; it did not flit but stayed constant. The devastation tore at the heart because it brought her to her knees. She was broken yet emanated strength.\nShe was strong! Why? Because had it been otherwise then the room would have been echoing with heart-wrenching sobs. It seemed as if something from the very core of her soul had been brutally ripped away; such wounds left no visible marks but scars that stayed timeless.\nShe gazed at one of the paintings quite aimlessly as if the vibrant colors held within their depth all the answers to her clashing thoughts. Tears lent a sheen to her otherwise blank eyes but last vestiges of pride wouldn\u2019t allow her to shed them. Self-respect and an inherent ego helped hold her head high but fragments of jarring memories snuck in through her otherwise heavily guarded armor. He was the chef concocting bittersweet memories and regrets and she played the character of a mute spectator to perfection.\nThere was very little she could do about it because now it was too late.\n\u201cIs it?\u201d, he would have asked with desperation and mockery lacing his voice. An icy hand closed around her heart as she thought of the man who had coaxed, manipulated, and cajoled her into questioning her sanity.\nShe tried hard to let go of the silent scream that wanted to deny his every accusation but her shattered soul and trembling hands told a different story.\nClenching her fists tightly, she reigned in her emotions and schooled her features to perfection. When she lifted her face, those looking at her were taken in by the smile on her luscious lips. She looked ethereal and so fragile. If one peered closely at her face then she was only a beautiful stranger enjoying the solitude."

At least I thought it was a coffee shop. The interior looked more like a store. Shelves were lined with brightly colored coffee mugs, coffee makers, coffee grinders, coffee presses, coffee candies, coffee undershirts, coffee spoons\u2013every coffee gimcrack and coffee gewgaw imaginable except for a basic percolator.\nThere wasn\u2019t a Formica table in sight. Customers sat in overstuffed chairs and at long communal tables, drinking out of paper cups rather than ceramic mugs. Each stared at a miniature battery powered television, some of which were attached to what looked like paperless typewriters.\nMany wore earplugs attached to colorful wires, which was advisable given the cacophony inside the coffee shop. Humans of the future are clearly hard of hearing, as the owner of this establishment blared the jukebox at a painful volume. Even worse: He had hidden speakers in the ceiling throughout the establishment, so there was no way to escape the onslaught. For some reason a series of blenders located inside the dining room rather than the kitchen whirred loudly. A group of employees behind the counter shouted above the din, yelling at each other and the customers.\n\u201cWelcome to Starbucks! What can I get started for you?!\u201d the counter gal shouted.\n\u201cCup of joe and a cruller, please,\u201d I said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s awesome! So retro!\u201d she screamed.\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d I said.

Neither the counter girl nor the sighing gentleman even smiled.\n\u201cThat will be $4.18, please. Just scan your card,\u201d the gal said.\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d the counter gal said.\n\u201cCome on, dude. Pay for your coffee and go back to your Klan rally,\u201d the sighing man said. I realized then that I must have said something inappropriate.\n\u201cDo you accept cash?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cCome. On!\u201d the gentleman behind me yelled.\n\u201cFor your order,\u201d she said, and she waved a paper coffee cup in the air.\n\u201cBrown,\u201d I said, and she wrote on the cup with a magic marker.\n\u201cJust move down there. It will be ready soon,\u201d the gal said.\nI stood near the end of the counter in a semicircle of customers awaiting their coffee. We looked as if we were stranded in an elevator lobby but for the fact that they all stared at their miniature televisions. The young lady beside me tapped on her tiny screen with her thumbs so frequently that I finally asked her what she was doing.\n\u201cTexting, as if it\u2019s any of your business,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t mean to be rude. I\u2019ve just never seen these little televisions before,\u201d I said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.

In the future, each person carries a portable television phone, but they use it as a telegraph.\n\u201cBrian, your order\u2019s ready,\u201d the counter boy shouted.\n\u201cWhat else do these cellphones do?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cTrumpelstiltskin, wake up.

It was if he knew I\u2019d been \u201casleep\u201d for 60 years, even if he didn\u2019t know how to pronounce Rumpelstiltskin.\nCan\u2019t wait until he stumbles across one of those safe places with all the coloring books!\nHave you been reading ahead?"

Kidspot spoke with lead Australian nutritionist Zoe Bingley-Pullin, who at the time said that one or two cups of coffee a day is fine.\nSimilarly, the Royal Hospital for Women advises patients, \"small amounts of caffeine are considered safe in pregnancy\". They advise expectant mothers to limit their coffee intake to 200mg per day, which is the equivalent to \"one cup of strong espresso style coffee, three cups of instant coffee, four cups of medium strength tea, four cups of cocoa or hot chocolate or four cans of cola.\"\nThe most important lesson here is, never get in between a pregnant lady and her one cup of coffee for the day."

                            "text": "Rachel Eunice Ostrom Lindahl took her last breath on 5 March, 2014. Not unexpected, yet still a jolt \u2013 \u2013 and continues to be. A sweet part of my life is missing. I\u2019m re-posting this in honor of her.\nThis is Rachel and me. Rachel is the mother of my best friend, Laurel, and I\u2019ve known her my entire life, since I was about one year old. She\u2019s my other mother and is as important to me as any of my own family members. She\u2019s my friend. Rachel is quiet and shy. She\u2019s sensitive, loving, sweet. And she loves to laugh! Especially with (at) Laurel and me!\nLaurel and I have been friends forever and have our own quirky humor and, after so many years together, a unique energy flows between us. In fact, Laurel\u2019s family mostly rolls their eyes at us when we get going with our little tricks that make us (and Rachel) laugh. We\u2019re like sister twins that have developed our own language and that language always includes quick-witted comments and hilarity. But my relationship with Laurel is another story. This is about Rachel.\nAbout one year ago Rachel began feeling unsteady on her feet and developed a slight shake. After lots of doctoring and medications, she\u2019s got a diagnosis and is learning to adapt to the fact that she requires 24-hour care. But I\u2019m not writing this to discuss her symptoms or her diagnosis. I\u2019m writing about Rachel and what she means to me and what it\u2019s like to see someone you love struggle with pain and lack of mobility.\nRachel is tall and statuesque. She has a beautiful smile and sparkling blue eyes. You notice her in a room and you\u2019re drawn to her sweet countenance. She\u2019s beautiful. She\u2019s naive in a way, believing in the best parts of people always; accepting us how we are. She loves unconditionally. She\u2019s sentimental. She feels pain deeply and carries it with her: The loss of her dear twin sister, Joan. The eventual dissolution of her marriage. The loss first of her father, then her mother. And now the sudden failing of her body.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d she sometimes says. And we know it\u2019s true. We know how hard it is for this active and graceful woman to be confined to her uncooperative body. And we all suffer in our own way for her, for her loss, for her sadness. For our loss, our sadness.\nBut here\u2019s the thing that buoys me: Rachel is still tall and statuesque. She still exudes sweetness and shyness and beauty and joy. She laughs. She\u2019s still herself. There\u2019s still time for me to let her know how deep my love is for her; what she\u2019s done for me in life.\nShe represents to me love and acceptance and joy. Unfailing. She\u2019s always curious about my life. She enjoys hearing what\u2019s going on with me. She loves listening to me talk and laugh. She wants me around. She loves me. She loves me now and she has always loved me. She knows me!\nAnd the best part of it all is that I still have time to let her know how important she is to me. I can still put puzzles together with her, I can still talk with her, and I can still laugh with her.\nThe other day we were all joking about how I didn\u2019t want to get up from puzzling to go to the bathroom. I asked Rachel if she would \u201cgo\u201d for me so that I wouldn\u2019t have to get up. A silly conversation, but we all laughed. But then she looked straight at me with her beautiful blue eyes and said I could sit on her lap in her wheelchair and she would wheel me in there if I needed her to. I laughed. But she was serious and she said, \u201cBecause I would do that for you Janie. I would do anything for you.\u201d I stopped laughing and looked back at her and said, \u201cI know you would do that for me, Rachel. I know you would.\u201d And it felt so good to know that she would; to know that this woman loves me and would do anything for me. And I would do the same for her."

                            "text": "Two hundred miles away, Rachel stares out the window of a Greyhound bus, wishing she could shut her eyes, if only for a few moments. But it\u2019s too dangerous for her to sleep in public, and absolutely out of the question to nod off on public transport, traveling at high speeds on a highway. She lets her forehead bounce against the glass, using every bump in the road to stay alert. The dark terrain and shadowy buildings outside her window send chills up Rachel\u2019s spine. Only a few more hours until the bus gets to Philly. Sleep would come when she could lie down in private. Maybe even in her old bedroom, with her grandmother\u2019s rosary beads under her pillow. Maybe she would rest peacefully for the first time in years, under the same roof as her brother.\nShe stares hard out the bus window, trying to picture her brother rummaging through her old things, silently willing him to find the box and the rosary. She is hopeful, but worried. Maybe she should have told him she was heading his way, but their phone conversation had not gone well.\n\u201cThere won\u2019t be another chance,\u201d she pleaded, hoping he couldn\u2019t hear the tremor in her voice.\n\u201cNo, Rachel. No there won\u2019t be another chance.\u201d If Gavin detected her emotion, he gave no indication in his response. \u201cMaybe youshould\u2019ve thought about that before you left. Before you jumped ship and headed for the Golden Coast.\u201d He paused, and Rachel could see him gripping the old receiver in the foyer, trying to control his temper.\nRachel\u2019s sigh sounds loud in the sleepy quiet of the bus. Her big brother. Always working on something, obsessing over every little detail. The straightlaced one. The pragmatist. The guy\u2019s got it all together. Everyone always said so. Their grandparents certainly thought so. They left their homes and all their possessions to him, though Rachel was only a year younger. Grandpa made Gavin the executor of his will and a non-voting member on the board of both of his surviving businesses. At the ripe old age of 19, Gavin became a property owner and board member in two successful Philadelphia companies. That was almost ten years ago now. Rachel imagines that he\u2019s had nothing but success ever since. She never cared about the money; not really. She wanted freedom. She needed to be away from the house and its Shadows.\nLeaving was her only option. At least, that what she thought when was eighteen. She had tried to tell her brother countless times that the house was haunted, but he never believed her. No one believed her. Their grandfather said he would look into it. A few weeks later Rachel was in counseling. She was ten. The therapist told her she was simply imagining scary things, and they weren\u2019t real. When her \u201cimagining\u201d persisted, they said she had unresolved emotional trauma from the accident. It was a good diagnosis, except Rachel had no memory of the wreck.\nShe only knew the story. They were coming home from a barbeque on the Fourth of July. Her father had been drinking. He ran a red light and hit a van head on. Rachel\u2019s parents and the woman in the van were both killed. Rachel and Gavin, ages four and five, were strapped into their car seats and received only minor bruises. Rachel couldn\u2019t remember anything from the night or the accident, but she certainly felt trauma. She tried to ignore the Shadows, because she wanted to believe they were her own invention.\nShe was thirteen when the nightmares started. Her therapist\u2019s \u201crepressed memories\u201d theory went out the window. She went to the hospital after her first nightmare. They called it an \u201cepisode\u201d. She was found lying at the bottom of the staircase, unconscious. Her grandmother thought she had fallen, but she didn\u2019t have any broken bones. Just minor bruises. They medicated her and it made her fits worse. Gavin thought she was pretending. Just trying to get attention. The nightmares got worse. Once they found her standing and screaming in the middle of her bed, clawing at her own face. Once the neighbors discovered her on their front porch. Her knees and hands were skinned and dirty, as if she had crawled all the way there. Rachel and Gavin grew further and further apart. When she turned eighteen, even when she learned there would be no inheritance, she was determined to get out. She thought leaving the house would make the terrors stop. She believed she was being possessed and haunted by some evil in her grandparents\u2019 house. But leaving didn\u2019t do any good. The Shadows followed.\nThe torment is worse now, because she doesn\u2019t have her family to help her hide. The hardest part is keeping an apartment. A roommate is completely out of the question. For ten years, she\u2019s been trying to pretend that everything is okay. Locking herself into her room at night. Never letting anyone stay over. But she can\u2019t do it anymore. She has to face that house, the place where it all started, and find a way to stop the Shadows.\nRachel\u2019s eyelids begin to droop, falling steadily lower and lower. She leans back, sits upright in her seat, away from the window. She shakes her head, feels the light sting of her ponytail slapping her cheeks. Awake Rache. Stay awake. But she is drifting between asleep and awake.\nAs her head bobs gently forward and back, a shadow drifts along the aisle of the bus. Pure black against the grey of the full, sleeping bus, the shadow is barely detectable. It is entirely out of place. There is no light to cause this shadow, no person or object to cast the shape. Yet, somehow, it\u2019s there, and it\u2019s moving. It is slinking along the floor in rolling kind of crawl, until it gets to Rachel\u2019s row. The dark thing rises up from the floor-boards, hovers for a moment next to her face, then settles onto the seat beside her.\nThis entry was posted on May 13, 2014, 9:39 am and is filed under Group Story, Guest Bloggers, Responding to Writing Prompts.

It\u2019s okay, because I\u2019m not the one admitted, although some would argue that I should be, or is that, \u201ccommitted\u201d? Anyway, I am a proud grandpa of my first grandchild. Eleanor (Ellie) was born Thursday evening, but her birth was a journey in itself.\nAt first, after mom was induced, she refused to come out. Come on, who could blame her? Water bed, room service, carried around everywhere, not a bad life. Then she must have heard a loud voice say they were going to come in and get her using entrance \u201cC\u201d. She probably thought that didn\u2019t sound like a good idea, because she instantly said goodbye to her room of the last 8 months and 1 week and looked for that glowing exit sign.\nShe came out, but brought the cord that connected her to life for the past months with her wrapped around her neck. Instantly it was cut and they rushed her into the NICU. They first said she would be in the hospital for several days, but it looks like this morning, three days after being born she will get to go home.\nFrom the time my daughter was told to head for the hospital immediately during a routine baby checkup till today many prayers have been prayed, and God heard them, and God responded. He answered the prayer that mom and baby be okay through this ordeal. He answered the prayer that she would exit my daughter\u2019s body naturally. He answered a lot of prayers that she would pull through the darkness of night. He answered the prayers that she wouldn\u2019t die, and there was one point in her first night they had to resuscitate her. He answered the prayers that she grow stronger by the hour, and that her color would stop making her look like a new form of Smurfs.\nMy point today is simply this: God hears, God cares, and God answers. You may not get the answer you wanted and I certainly cannot explain why, but this I do know; God\u2019s ways are higher than our ways. That is why it takes faith. Not just faith for the answered prayers, but faith for trust in God when they are not answered. Remember this though: If you are going to pray for rain then at least grab an umbrella before you leave the house."

Obviously everything that you pray for doesn\u2019t always happen, and it seems like I\u2019ve only had a few prayers answered out of quite a lot. Why doesn\u2019t God answer my prayers?\nWe have to trust that God knows best and knows infinitely more than us, so sometimes God doesn\u2019t answer your prayers for your own good. He always gives us what\u2019s best at the right time that it\u2019s meant to be. So if what you ask for is beneficial for you then He\u2019ll answer your prayers, otherwise you have to trust that it wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. He can see things that we aren\u2019t aware of or don\u2019t know yet, and one day you\u2019ll have the hindsight to be thankful that things happened the way they did!\nIt\u2019s not enough to just pray to God when you\u2019re in a tight spot.

We have to prove that we\u2019re true believers through the good and the bad.\nIn order for a prayer to be answered, certain conditions have to be met first. God doesn\u2019t answer your prayers if your heart isn\u2019t truly opened to him or if you are living sinfully. Faith is how prayers are answered, so you have to truly believe in God. Just having belief isn\u2019t enough though; you have to live the life of a good Christian as well. God helps His followers that are loyal and pious.\nThis is exactly how i feel rightnow.

After over a transfers of prayers, and a second transfer of teaching appointments, Krystal, Evelyn, and Joe were baptized this past Friday. Earlier in the week, at the baptismal interviews, Evelyn surprised us by saying she no longer wanted to be baptized and that she wanted to wait until she was 11. We were so shocked and all Sister Meng and I could do was pray that it would all work out and that she would be able to be baptized with her mom and brother that Friday. After A LOT of prayer, we got a text from Krystal the next day saying that Evelyn had changed her mind and that the reason she hadn't wanted to get baptized was because she thought if she got baptized she wouldn't get to meet with us anymore (I don't think she realized that if she hadn't gotten baptized we would've had to drop her as an investigator and that she would have to stop meeting with us anyways...). It was wonderful to see that prayer answered as well. It seemed as if the whole ward showed up for the baptism, we had to move the service into the chapel because there was no way everyone would have fit in the Relief Society room where we usually hold the baptism programs. Yet again, another prayer answered. Then on Sunday, Housen was baptized. We've been praying for just as long that he would progress and be able to accept baptism. To see his growth as he came to believe God exists and strengthen his faith has been amazing. Right before the baptismal program was about to begin, Meng Jiemei and I were really worried since so few people were in attendence. We sped around the church trying to find people who weren't in meetings to attend (ward conference was keeping everyone busy), but we weren't having much luck. It was such a miracle when we ran out of the room to take pictures and when we came back the room had somehow filled with people. However, we were still really concerned because so little food had been brought and we really wanted Housen to feel welcomed to the ward. We decided it really wasn't that important and that there wasn't anything more that we could do, so we went in to start the program. After the program when we went to bring the food out, we were surprised to find that a member had popped into the kitchen during the program and had noticed how little food there was, ran home, and then brought the food that she had at her house in order to make it a warmer welcome to the ward for Housen. Prayer after prayer answered. I am so grateful for the love that God has for each of His children and how He cares about each of us enough to answer our individual prayers. All my love!"

This could lead people to be even stronger in their faith and religion.\nA reason why people would argue that prayers are always answered, is if you always pray to God with a good heart and have strong confidence in your prayers, God will certainly answer them. This will, as a result, make people pray even more and become more regular in praying. Also, if you pray with a thought that they will actually be answered, then they will come true as well.\nOn the other hand, peoples prayers aren\u2019t answered is if there is a lack of God\u2019s presence; you don\u2019t feel connected with God. This could cause prayers to be unanswered, because if you don\u2019t think that there is someone that is going to answer them, and then there will be no answer. Also, people could think that prayers are not being answered, because if you pray for someone to get better, and they die. This is another reason why people could feel that their prayers aren\u2019t being answered, because as the ill person has not got better, and died, people will think that there isn\u2019t actually anyone listening to their prayers, and this could also cause people to not believe in God.\nPersonally, I think that God always answers prayers, because from my own experiences, if you pray to God with a good thought, then they will be answered. Also, I think that if you are religious, then you are more likely to pray than non-religious people; and if you think that there is a God answering your prayers then your prayers will also be easily answered."

I\u2019d never known this girl before, I\u2019d never read any of her books before, but the news of her death hurt my heart so bad\u2026it hurt me so bad like she were my own flesh and blood. My heart sank, and my mind couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her. I was hurt for her family\u2026her friends\u2026her faithful readers\u2026I was hurt for those who loved her truly, so I did the only thing I knew I could do at the time \u2013 I prayed for her family\u2026I prayed for them with all of my heart. I prayed for them like I knew them. I prayed for them like they knew me.\nBut that\u2019s not all my story.\nAgain last year, I was checking out online for this couple who used to own an amazing restaurant. I\u2019d been following their TV show for quite a while. They were a couple who really inspired me. They loved the Lord, they loved each other, and they loved their family. But last year, as I typed in their names in the \u2018search space\u2019 on Google I was surprised at the first thing I saw. How did it even happen? Why did they get divorced? I read the story online and my heart was sad beyond words. I couldn\u2019t believe it. Why do things like this happen? Why do people make bad choices? Why are people so insecure\u2026so insecure that they let it get to their own family? My heart was hurt and my mind thought about them for a long while \u2013 especially about the woman. I did the only thing I could do at the time \u2013 I prayed for them\u2026with all of my heart, I prayed for them.\nMy purpose and reason for writing the above stories is to let you know that bad things still happen \u2013 yes they do. And sometimes we just can\u2019t explain why\u2026sometimes, we just can\u2019t seem to comprehend how it all went wrong. Of course I\u2019m not here to scare you or to feed you with negativity but I\u2019m actually writing this to remind you that in the midst of all the bad happenings, you still have every reason to believe, to see and to know that God is Good. You still have every reason to believe that God is All-powerful and that He will keep you safe in a world where things aren\u2019t that safe. You still have every reason to believe that your own marriage will work regardless of how many people keep getting divorced. Now, I\u2019m not saying I blame all couples who get divorced\u2026I understand that sometimes some things go very wrong and people make their decisions\u2026but I\u2019m just saying that I won\u2019t let myself feel discouraged by the number of divorces that keep occurring.\nWe have to remember and believe that our God is stronger than the dangers of this world. Our God will keep us because He is more than able to keep. Our God will always have our health in mind, our going out in mind, our coming in in mind. Our God will do just what He says He will do. And please don\u2019t ask me why bad things happen. I don\u2019t have the answer. I don\u2019t entirely know. I guess it\u2019s just the world we live in and the choices people make\u2026and maybe some other reasons too \u2013 I honestly don\u2019t know. However, regardless of all the things that keep happening, l choose to hold on to this one thing till I die: That God is forever Good. And that God is forever my Rock, my Shelter and my Safety.\nSo look to Jesus today and don\u2019t let the fear of things happening around get the best of you. Tell Him how you feel. Tell Him why you feel afraid. Tell Him what you feel afraid about. Be vulnerable with Him. Pray to Him, He will hear you and He will answer you."

                            "text": "Twelfth Sunday of the Year. Fr Martin Ganeri finds no answer to the problem of suffering, but perhaps a solution.\nSome years back, just a few weeks after being ordained a priest, I found myself chaplain for a month at one of the London hospitals. One day I was called to the bedside of a young boy dying of cancer. His parents were there and we all sat together for the last few hours of his life.\nAt one point the mother asked, 'Why does God let this happen?' An obvious question, a natural question, but still the kind you dread. And really the only thing that I could say was that I did not know. I had no answer that could satisfy the bewilderment that a mother feels as she watches her son die, let alone soothe the pain. All I could do was to be with them in those hours, to offer the sacraments, to pray with and for them.\nTwo years later I too found myself asking that same question, 'Why does God let this happen?' This time it was my father who was dying of cancer. Though perhaps more easily in the face of old age comes the answer that this is only natural, the way our bodies are, still it did not satisfy the questions I had about why it had to happen to him, why he had to be the one to suffer that fate, satisfy the deeper yearning that I had for more time, for his company for longer. So all that I could do in those last few hours in his presence was to be there with my bother and sister and later with them perform the funeral rites.\nIn the passage for today from the book of Job, God is said to give Job an answer as he asks, 'Why does God let this happen?' Throughout the many chapters of that book many others have tried to find an answer that will meet Job's bewilderment, his anger and his pain. Job has lost everything, his family and his possessions. He has lost his health and reputation. Why had God let this happen to him, when he has done nothing wrong? None of the answers others give can satisfy him. Perhaps God, however, will explain why he has done this to Job, why he lets it happen.\nAnd yet God's answer when it comes is more a barrage of questions that challenge Job himself to account for his impudence in calling God to account. Is Job on a level with God the creator either in power or knowledge, so that God should explain himself to Job? The wisdom and justice of creation and of the fate of each being within it is understood by God, yet it remains beyond the reach of men and women.\nIn the end Job receives no straightforward answer to his questions, but is reduced to silence in the awesome presence of God. The questions he kept on asking and the answers he searched for, are themselves transcended in this great theophany, in this experience of the divine.\nWell, we might think, that is our experience too, though without the comfort -- if that is what it is -- of such a display of divine presence. Job is reduced to silence and we are reduced to silence, without answers to our bewilderment and pain.\nAnd yet, if not an answer, we do find here the beginnings of a solution. God is the creator and there is a wisdom and justice in his creation even if this lies outside our comprehension. God is also not absent from the bewilderment and pain of those who suffer in his creation. Instead God reaches into his creation to be present with those who suffer and finally to release them from their sufferings.\nDo you not care? Why do you let this happen? The same question once again.\nThe solution Jesus offers us is his own suffering, a suffering which finally will mean the end of all our suffering, which finally will mean a new life in God's new creation. This is not an answer in any straightforward sense and the many attempts to explain the Passion of Christ in the New Testament or in the Church's tradition can never fully satisfy us if we ask why God let it happen.\nWe are faced not by an answer, but by a solution. A solution we might ponder in silence, even share with others in silence."

Over the past few years, she has been through two battles with cancer, two surgeries, and her husband has had heart surgery and a job loss. She should be bitter. She should be questioning God. She should be needing others to lift her up and help her stay strong. But she\u2019s not. Instead, she is an encouragement to everyone in her life. She lifts others up and helps their faith stay strong. My sister seems to have it all backwards when it comes to her attitude towards suffering.\nSeeing all the suffering in my sister\u2019s life, and in the lives of other people surrounding me, has caused me to reflect upon the whole issue of suffering in general. Here are a few of my conclusions.\n1. Suffering happens. It just does. No one is immune to the pain that this world has to offer. As soon as sin entered the world, our world began to decay, and this includes the human body as well. To live in this world means that there will be times when you will face suffering \u2014 it can\u2019t be avoided.\n2. Suffering is not eternal. Our suffering is only temporary. Some days it might seem like it will never end, but God promises us that there will be no suffering in heaven. One day He will wipe every tear from our eyes and there will be no more crying or pain or death or cancer or unemployment or any of the other horrible things we suffer here on earth. That is what makes my sister so different in her response to suffering. As a Christian, she has this hope of eternal life without suffering and it is this hope that helps her face each new trial here on earth.\n3. God is not the one who causes suffering. God does not look down and say, \u201cHey, that person has gotten a little too comfortable with her life. She needs to suffer awhile so she can learn some character.\u201d No! Let me say it again: Suffering just happens!\nI often hear people blame God for everything that happens in their lives. They will say, \u201cWhy, God? Why did this happen to me?\u201d Or perhaps they phrase it this way, \u201cWhy would God let that happen to . . \u201c. Or the REALLY spiritual ones will say, \u201cEverything happens for a reason.\u201d This thinking is all wrong. Everything does NOT happen for a reason. Saying there is a reason for everything is just a Christianized version of blaming God! Think about it. If there truly is a reason for everything, then God must have a reason, which means God must have caused the suffering in order to bring that reason about. I will say it a third time: Suffering just happens . . . sometimes for no reason at all.\nThe Bible never promises that our lives will be exempt from pain. Rain falls on both the righteous and the unrighteous. We live in a fallen world, and because we live in a fallen world bad things happen. Let me suggest that the real question we should be asking is \u201cWhy not, God? Why not me?\u201d To live in this present world is to live in a world of suffering \u2014 a trouble free life is abnormal.\n4. God will help us find purpose in our suffering. Notice I said \u201cIN\u201d our suffering, not \u201cTO\u201d our suffering. There is a difference. Romans 8:28 says that God works all things out for the good of those who love Him. This verse does not say that God causes bad things to happen, or that God has a reason for everything. What it does say is that God will take the bad that happens in our lives and show us how to make good out of it.\nGod did not cause my sister\u2019s cancer. God did not have some grand purpose in mind when she got sick. She got sick because sickness happens. However, He has worked in her life through her suffering. He has used her testimony to challenge and encourage many, many people. He is using my sister in ways she might not even realize until eternity comes. He has taken her cancer and made good come about. Romans 8:28 is being lived out in her life on a daily basis.\n5. God wants us to help the suffering. It is amazing the way Christians have come together to help my sister and her family. I thank God for the church family of which she is a part. They have helped and encouraged her more than they will ever know.\nPeople can truly make a difference in the midst of suffering. It is during these times of intense suffering where Christianity is allowed to shine the most. We need to be willing to get our hands dirty, to risk broken hearts and grief in order to help alleviate the suffering around us. When Jesus was confronted with suffering, he had compassion. He got involved. He reached out his hands to help. We need to be the same way. When we see suffering around us, we need to have compassion. We need to get involved. We need to reach out our hands and help. It is in those moments when Christ\u2019s love will shine, cutting through the darkness and leading people to Him."

How do you feel about this line now that you have read New Moon and know exactly how Edward would react were Bella ever to die?\nI don\u2019t think that Alice realizes exactly how far Edward would go if Bella were to die. I think she is basing this on the past Edward who hasn\u2019t met Bella yet. I think the past Edward must really depress and miserable. Then he meets Bella, and she makes him so happy by bring out the human emotions that he kept buried. Since all of Edwards family loves him (and Bella of course) they want to make sure that they stay together so that Edward doesn\u2019t sink back into his depression.\n2. Jasper talks more in this chapter than any other chapter. What things do we learn about his character from the way he reacts to Bella? Were you ever afraid of him during this chapter?\nWe learn that he is getting better with knowing his limits because when Bella was sitting in the living room, he sat in the far corner. We also learn that he loves his family and cares about Bella as well. I wasn\u2019t afraid of him in this chapter. I was however afraid of him in The Short Second Life of Bree Tanner. Before the Volturi came at the end of the book, Jasper was being very aggressive towards Bree, telling her \u201cClose your eyes and cover your ears\u201d and I didn\u2019t understand why he was being so mean. She wasn\u2019t really an enemy.\n3.\tThis is the first time we learn that the vampires are venomous. What was your reaction to this news and did it make you think twice about the fact that Edward had kissed Bella?\nEdward would never let anything hurt Bella, and he is so against her becoming a vampire, so he must have been kiss him without getting venom in her mouth. I was surprised though, but no I didn\u2019t think twice about the fact that Edward had kissed Bella.\n4.\tWhy do you suppose Edward has been so adamant about not telling Bella how someone becomes a vampire?\nHe doesn\u2019t want her to know because she may go behind his back and have someone turn her. Also, I think that he sees everything that Bella has to lose by becoming a vampire. She will see all her friends and family die before her. She wouldn\u2019t be able to walk in the sunlight without sparkling. She won\u2019t be able to go near her family or friends for a while because she would lust for their blood. He doesn\u2019t want to take any of this away from her.\n5. Alice has a vision of the dance studio and the proceeds to question Bella about any reasons why she might go there. It seems to me that Alice saw Bella at the studio. Why didn't Alice clear this up for Bella by explaining to her that she shouldn't go to the studio?\nI don\u2019t think that Alice saw Bella in the studio until a little before they arrived at the airport. When she did see the vision, I think that she let it happen because she knew that Bella would survive it and that it was to only way for them to catch and kill James.\nAlice knows just how much Bella means to her brother, and she does not want to lose her brother or see him suffer for centuries on end. She also cares very much for Bella, and wouldn't want to see anything bad happen to her new-found friend. However, I think her main reason is that she would be so concerned for Edward, especially since he would go to the Volturi to get himself killed. Alice doesn't want to see the only family she's ever known get torn apart that way.\nI wasn't afraid of him. Really, to me, he's only creepy in the movies. In the books he seems very calm. He also cares about the family, even though he does still struggle a bit with the lifestyle.\n3. This is the first time we learn that the vampires are venomous. What was your reaction to this news and did it make you think twice about the fact that Edward had kissed Bella?\nI didn't think twice about the kissing. I did feel concern about the fact that the transformation is so painful. I knew that Bella wanted to be turned and that really it was the only long term solution. So here was when we found out that Bella was in for a lot of pain and suffering in the future.\n4. Why do you suppose Edward has been so adamant about not telling Bella how someone becomes a vampire?\nHe knows, based on what Alice has seen, that Bella will want to be turned. I'm pretty sure that Alice has seen Bella as a vampire, but that Edward is determined to make sure that Alice is wrong and Bella remains human.\nI think Alice was afraid to put the idea into Bella's head, if she hadn't already considered it.\nI don't think Alice realises at this stage exactly how far Edward would go if Bella dies, although she knows he'd take it hard.\nNo, I thought he was very caring in this chapter. I think he shows how much he can care, and I think he demonstrates more self control than he probably realises he's got.\nNo. Again, Edward wouldn't have done that if it was going to endanger Bella. I don't recall this news effecting me very much.\nBecause he doesn't want her to get any funny ideas.\nNone of them knew at that stage that Bella would be asked to go there. They probably thought that all they would need to do is ensure that she stayed away from it. And even if Bella had known this, she still would have gone there in order to save her mother. The realisation that it must have been her old ballet studio that Alice saw didn't change her decision.\nI remember when I first read that and thinking to myself..Wow how much Edward loves Bella. I knew that they meant he would be in a dark place if anything ever happen to her. I didn't think about suicide until I read NM. Their love is powerful.\nNo I was never afraid of Jasper. I just knew it was difficult to be around her. It showed to me that he cared what happens to her and already accepted her in the family.\nYou know I don't over think what the author wrote b/c I then think it can ruin a book. I always accepted that he had to bite her in order to change her vs. kissing.\nHe knew that their relationship was evolving, he didn't want her to want to be changed, or know how to do it, in fear if she asked him, he would decline, then she would look some other way to become one.\nHmm good question. I have always wondered that myself."

                            "text": "Oftentimes with deep wounds, the skin covering the wound will heal while lurking beneath the surface, infection continues to grow and spread. Eventually the pain will become increasingly evident with swelling and redness spreading to the surface area as well.\nIn order for the wound to heal, the surface skin must be lanced allowing the infection to drain. If the wound is deep enough, a \u201cwick\u201d will be added to insure all infection will be drawn out and washed away. No real, complete healing can take place until all festering infection has been removed from the wound.\nBy looking at the many unfolding events, as scary as some of them at first glance appear to be, we can choose to see them as a wound being lanced. So much frustration on so many levels has built up over the years and try as we may, no real healing can begin in our society, our humanity, our families, our global connections, as well as our connection to Gaia and all that inhabit her until the wound is first lanced.\nWe have a beautiful opportunity to see this as a deep purging of all that has infected our minds, bodies, hearts and souls. We can band together and with love allow all that is \u201cother than love\u201d to spill forth for healing and clearing.\nIt is a common occurrence to hear, \u201cSend love to _______________\u201d (insert person\u2019s name), or \u201cSend love to ____________\u201d (insert situation or place). To me, while VERY WELL INTENDED, that almost implies that there is something inherently wrong with the person, place or situation named.\nWhat if instead of sending love, we BECAME love. By holding the highest vibration possible\u2026. the vibration of LOVE, we are becoming the wick. By being in the state of love with no agenda, we are a wick that ultimately brings healing. The unknown, unseen pain and infection of others can be wicked away just by standing near them in line at the grocery store. Even when our personal, work, social and family situations are not as we would prefer, we can still hold a space for and be the wick of love.\nPatiently being the wick of love can be the most difficult and yet the most loving thing any of us can do right now. Each person must go through their own process, releasing what has been festering within their hearts for far too long. Some we cross paths with will be estranged from friends, co-workers as well as family members and loved ones at this time.\nBeing the wick of love does not mean we do not feel all of the unpleasant emotions of anger, hurt, disappointment, etc. In many ways we feel them MORE, we feel them deeper. The difference is that we do not allow emotions that are all too often ignored or at best, suppressed take us away from love. We feel and contain them all!\nIt takes great strength to hold the space and be the wick of love. It takes faith that love WILL win in the end. It takes both courage and patience to wait and endure that which you do not prefer. It takes great determination and willpower to be at peace with and hold conflicting emotions.\nMost of all it takes the depth of unconditional love to wait patiently, to lovingly BE the wick of love for what may take months, years or even lifetimes for true healing to occur.\nUltimately it is understanding and accepting that only by being the wick of love will we bring the healing we are all so desperately in need of."

                            "text": "Anger may unavoidable, but how can I make it less devastating? How can I cope with my anger? How can I cope with your anger? How can I cope with your anger when you direct it at me? Coping with anger is simple\u2026but not necessarily easy. Like most things, it takes trust, some practice, and some learning. And, the better you get at coping with your anger, the more space you create to give and receive love.\nThe first thing to understand is that our feelings are rarely just one emotion or another. Rather, feelings cluster and combine. We usually speak of feeling angry when we are also feeling frightened and ashamed and hurt. When I became a certified Parent Effectiveness Trainer (PET) through the Gordon Training Institute, I was taught a wonderful metaphor for our feelings \u2013 The Feelings Iceberg. Remember that only 10% of an iceberg shows above the oceans surface, 90% lies submerged and hiding. Just so with our anger. While anger may show on the surface, beneath the surface can be sadness, pain, fear, shame, hurt, and more.\nPhysiologically, the part of our brain that is responsible for feeling, the brain stem, only experiences pleasure or pain. That\u2019s it, just pleasure or pain. It doesn\u2019t make any further distinctions. Then the thinking part of the brain, the cerebral cortex, analyzes, distorts, deletes, generalizes, compares, judges, categorizes the feeling into anger or fear or whatever. Then language is applied to the thought, further defining and categorizing. When you tell someone that you am angry you may never realize all the other ways you are feeling pain. And, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed, that when you are done yelling or screaming or righteously lecturing, you don\u2019t feel better, your relationship isn\u2019t better, nothing seems better. That\u2019s when most people decide that expressing anger doesnt work. In actuality, you\u2019ve exposed 10% of the iceberg and ignored the other 90%, crashing into the submerged part and, perhaps, tearing a big hole in your relationship.\nA key strategy for coping with anger, your\u2019s or anyone else\u2019s, is to look at the entire iceberg, to find out what is under the anger. The nature of feelings is that, once acknowledged they transform. Saying sentences that begin \u201cI\u2019m frightened that\u2026\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m hurt that\u2026\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m sad that\u2026\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m ashamed that\u2026\u201d, help you to begin to understand more of what is sourcing your pain and to free your feelings to change. When someone is blasting you with their anger, ask them to also tell you about their other feelings. Acknowledging the whole iceberg is what melts it.\nThis entry was posted in Uncategorized and tagged anger, brain, coping with anger, fear, feelings, hurt, pain, sadness, shame, transforming.

                            "text": "News & Stories \u00bb Why Am I So Angry?\nViolence levels are on the rise in our nation and world, and the Church is not exempt from its impact. As those who love God, how do we address anger as a natural part of our soul care and then help others diffuse the anger in their lives too? There are many forms of anger, so don\u2019t be too quick to assume that you are not an angry person.\nAnger is a strong feeling of displeasure and antagonism aroused by a sense of injury or wrong. Healthy anger can act as a powerful force for producing change in our lives at every level. It can be a gift that signals things are not OK.\nThere are three types of anger mentioned in Scripture. The first type includes a stewing or festering that brews just below the surface and doesn\u2019t come out. The Greek word for this type of anger is parogismos used in Ephesians 6:4, exhorting fathers to not provoke their children to anger.\nThe second type of anger occurs when something important to you is threatened or damaged. The Greek word is orgizo used in Ephesians 4:26\u2014\u201cBe angry (orgizo), but do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger (parogizo) and give no opportunity to the devil.\u201d Paul is saying to feel the anger but not to sin by refusing to deal with the festering anger below the surface, which gives the devil a place in your life.\nThe third type of anger is what Galatians 5:20 refers to as \u201coutbursts of anger\u201d or \u201cfits of rage.\u201d The Greek word is thymos, or rage, which passionately erupts and then cools down quickly, whereas the orgizo is indignation that gradually builds and settles in.\nMany people don\u2019t think they have a problem with anger but are sarcastic, passive aggressive, numb, depressed, or apathetic. Each of these expressions is an indication of indirect anger.\nThe word sarcasm means \u201ctearing of flesh.\u201d It is intended to cut a person but is covered with a fa\u00e7ade of humor.\nPassive-aggressive people pretend everything is fine. Then they say things to others, often acting like a victim, to get other people to confront or speak for them, because they can\u2019t approach the person with whom they have a problem. This type of manipulation is calculated and driven by anger.\nDepressed people turn their anger inward rather than choosing to express it outwardly. In an attempt to keep the peace, they push down all negative feelings to avoid hurting the people around them.\nPeople who feel numb have shut down emotionally to survive. Long-term chaotic or abusive situations cause them to close off emotionally to cope. They no longer feel joy or pain. They live in a constant state of numbness, and their anger has become frozen.\nApathy is a sign that passion and hope are gone. Not caring is the only way a hurting person endures the pain. Apathy is a logical conclusion to an emotional issue. Rather than caring and feeling continual hurt, fear, or powerlessness, a person chooses not to care so he or she can function in everyday life.\nIn 1992 I became pregnant with our fourth child. My anger toward the other three children surpassed the usual irritations or annoyances of typical childish behavior, and I found myself overreacting to almost everything they did.\nIf they spilled their drinks at the table, I went into a rage. If they started whining at the grocery store, I would take them into the bathroom or car and spank them. They were just tired and needed compassion, but what they got was frustration and an anger that forced them into unhealthy obedience. I felt disrespected, humiliated, and exposed as a bad mother because they wouldn\u2019t listen to me, and I used my power to make them pay.\nAs I look back now, I realize I felt shame over their behavior. It makes no sense that I expected an 18-month-old, 2-year-old, and 4-year-old who were tired and hungry to handle a long day that ended at the grocery store without complaint. But I did. My parenting revolved around what other people would think and not about what my children needed.\nThis feeling of shame intimidated me into silence, and it wasn\u2019t until I heard a sermon at church that it was OK not to be OK that I felt a dam burst inside of me. I finally determined to be honest about my feelings and seek the help I needed.\nWhen I told my husband about my over-the-top behavior toward our children, he initially passed my anger off as just a reaction to a bad day. I continued to confess to him my actions toward the children when he wasn\u2019t around to show him how bad it really was. Thankfully, he didn\u2019t respond with more shame but encouraged me to talk with our senior pastor (the one who preached the sermon about not being OK), and I began to meet with him and his wife for the next four months to deal with the root of my anger instead of the symptoms.\nThe interesting part of the story is that my husband was the associate pastor of the same church. I was a pastor\u2019s wife and treated my children that way. How shameful! I believed the lie that I should be perfect as the pastor\u2019s wife; therefore, my children should be perfect too.\nDuring my prayer counseling sessions, I learned of six emotional causes underlying anger. Anger is what presents itself to others, but the primary emotion is underneath the anger. Understanding these six causes helped me identify the hurt and deal with it.\nFear can be a strong emotion causing people to feel weak, vulnerable, and powerless, so they rise up in anger to push people away and regain a sense of control. The rush of adrenaline that accompanies anger makes a person feel strong and hides the hidden terror.\n2. Your opinion is invalidated.\nEveryone wants to be heard whether in a business meeting or at the dinner table. A person\u2019s opinion is simply his or her viewpoint on a topic. To criticize someone\u2019s viewpoint or, worse yet, ignore the person completely, can cause anger. This is often seen in autocratic homes where one parent is always right and children aren\u2019t allowed to have different opinions.\n3. Your way is blocked.\nThis attitude is where road rage stems from\u2014\u201cGet out of my way!\u201d Whether a person\u2019s car is cut off on the freeway, or the budget is cut dissolving the business plan, or a 2-year-old is told no, anger results. It is probably the most volatile of all the underlying causes because it erupts spontaneously.\nWhen a person is hurt, the offense is either turned inward, leading to despair or depression, or turned outward, leading to anger and bitterness. When turned inward, the person seeks to contain the anger by taking it out on him/herself, and self-rejection and self-hatred results. Turning the hurt outward can lead to blame and seeking revenge toward the person who hurt you. The healthy response to hurt is to feel the sadness, loss, and pain of the wounding.\n5. Your personhood is attacked.\nName calling and inappropriate comments about your gender, ethnicity, sexuality, or beliefs fit this category. Oftentimes, these comments are made sarcastically or with a joking tone to get a laugh. Outwardly people might smile or play along, but inwardly the very core of the person has been touched, and it hurts.\n6. Your expectations are unmet.\nThe angry person flies off the handle because of an unfulfilled expectation that is never spoken to the person receiving the anger. The angry person assumes the expectation is obvious, so he or she doesn\u2019t need to communicate it directly. It should just be known. This happens in any relationship with assumptions and poor communication.\nAnger leaves a wake of pain. The next time you get angry, pause for a moment and sift through these six areas to identify the underlying cause of your anger. It can help you communicate clearly and avoid many arguments and disagreements in your relationships.\nHow Do I Get Rid of My Anger?\nWe can\u2019t rid ourselves of anger because it is an emotion; however, we can learn to appropriately deal with the real issue underlying the anger so it doesn\u2019t fester or spew in unhealthy ways to hurt people around us. Here are five ways to self\u2013check your anger level for your personal soul care.\n1. Acknowledge the way in which anger generally surfaces in your life\u2014aggression, passive-aggressiveness, sarcasm, numbness, apathy, depression, or rage.\n2. Ask the Holy Spirit to help you identify the underlying issue as the source: fear, invalidation, blocked goals, woundedness, attacks on your personhood, or unmet expectations.\n3. Ask for help so you don\u2019t suffer in silence. Telling a close friend, spouse, or counselor about your anger disarms its power in your mind.\n4. Grieve the loss accompanying the pain to process all the feelings surrounding the incident.\n5. Choose to forgive the offender. Forgiveness does not always mean reconciliation for those who have hurt you and may not ever involve a conversation with the other person. Rather, forgiveness eliminates bitterness from forming in your heart to torment you and cut off intimacy with God and those you love. Satan is a roaring lion looking for someone to devour. Let us not allow our unresolved anger to be the entry point of our destruction.\nIt\u2019s been 24 years since I came clean with my husband and began to deal with my anger in a healthy way. I still feel anger, but it doesn\u2019t control me as it once did. You too can be free from anger\u2019s grip. Go beneath it and diffuse it.\n4 responses to Why Am I So Angry?\nThank you! As the wife of a Pastor for over 35 years\u2026 I especially relate to Wanda\u2019s felt \u201cshame for not being perfect or having perfect children\u201d. I am so grateful our LORD is faithful to redeem our imperfections! And that HE does deliver us from unhealthy anger. (still a process) ?\nGood topic. A great awareness for personal growth.Thank you for sharing your own personal experience!\nGood topic\u2026A very helpful awareness for personal growth\u2026a great invitation to start entering the path of how to go about it.Thank you for sharing your own personal experience!\nThank you, Dr. Wanda Walborn. A great read and reminder for everyone. Emotions are too often suppressed or set aside resulting in discontent and adding to our daily frustrations. It is ok to not be ok. But it is also important to be aware of ourselves and our actions."

                            "text": "There is a wave of anger bubbling just beneath the surface. It is there because someone feels like they have been taken for granted. Conversations are one-sided at times, and feelings are seemingly unimportant. Patience and empathy are a strong suit for some, so they let it ride until the day comes when they really need to be heard. It is then they find that they are ignored.\nYou love, but reciprocated love seems just out of reach while continuing to give of yourself without expectation. There is always a thank you, but never a thank you note.\nResolution is found for others because listening is easy and having the ability to help them put the puzzle of competing feelings, emotions, and facts together to build a concrete plan comes naturally. But, some find when the time comes for reciprocation of this support, it is unavailable.\nDo they believe the facade of all is well because your life looks so put together from the outside? Or, the answer to a lack of support could be, they simply do not realize they are behaving in that way.\nFrom love to anger and resentment is a razor-thin line, and when walking that edge the decision is whether to tell them or let that anger or resentment go.\nAnger comes when people feel unappreciated, not supported emotionally, and not heard when they need someone close to listen. To resolve these issues and stay off that razor\u2019s edge; we must figure out what it takes to communicate our needs.\nBecause, when anger bubbles and sizzles just beneath the surface, it is like a volcano building pressure or a pot of water about to boil over. Whether cooling it off or releasing the tension, something has to give to prevent a massive eruption that can have long-lasting effects on the relationship.\nWhat do you do to ease the pressure and temperature building up? Do you tamp it down and cool it off by walking or writing or meditating? Or, do you allow it to explode in your conversations and interactions with your partner? If squashing the anger is a usual reaction, then like the magma of a volcano, the action only increases the pressure until a buildup of volcanic gases causes an eruption to occur.\nWhen it comes to anger, angst, or frustration, the question really becomes to release or not to release. If released, will it escalate into a full-blown argument where words said can never be recalled and the pain they cause worse than the hurt inflicted by the instigating event?\nThere are times when even the best \u2018filter\u2019 is overridden by the angst and there is nothing that will stop those words spoken in anger.\nWhile you try to remain calm when angry, it is difficult, especially when repetitive behavior causes you to feel like you are taken for granted. To diffuse the situation and make a point, pick a spot and tell them without making it an attack on their behavior.\nWhat is the best way to maintain quality relationships? Listening and an ability to empathize are great ways to maintain healthy relationships.\nTo keep anger and hurt at bay make sure you take time to listen, and, also, set boundaries to be sure your needs are met as well. Without reciprocation in a relationship, anger and resentment will bubble just beneath the surface threatening the well-being of not only the individuals but the relationship. Remember to listen, love, and understand that they need the same support you do.\nBy creating a healthy relationship, you can avoid the witch\u2019s brew of anger and resentment.\nBorn and raised in Belmont, North Carolina, I have lived an eclectic life and my writing portrays my varied interests from inspirational to historical fiction.

She aimed high, she did the work, and she reached the top! Adding to her many scholastic honors, Ayo became our first perfect scorer. She scored a perfect 800 on the Critical Reading section AND a perfect score of 12 out of 12 on the essay. Ayo's other scores were also impressive -- 750 on the Writing section and over 700 on the Math. We're very proud of this hard-working and focused young lady and what she has accomplished.\nThese amazing scores of this Lovejoy HS junior were from the SAT that she took last October. Ayo completed our Triple Threat Test Prep course in the fall of her freshman year and took it again in the fall of her sophomore year. She did well both times and made significant gains in her practice test scores. She also learned the most vocabulary words in the class. \"I reviewed the words a lot,\" she says. (We know that vocabulary is actually a good predictor of overall SAT performance so her attention to this area was an effective strategy.) In addition, she did extra practice tests at home so she became very comfortable with the types of questions on the test. She also gives props to the specific strategies she learned for analyzing SAT reading passages. She believes that applying those strategies was a significant contribution to her perfect Critical Reading score.\nWe wish Ayo continued success in all of her endeavors!\n\"For math, I took heed of the instructor's suggestion to focus on the questions I know that I do the best on. I found more of those types of problems, and practiced with them.\" That may sound counter-intuitive, but it works! She also stated that she carried her SAT vocabulary cards with her and regularly took a few minutes here and there to review them.\n\"When I saw my October scores, I was ecstatic! My mom was even more excited!\" We were happy, too, Paige! We knew you had the ability to do very well on the test and were pleased to see how well you applied what you learned in the Triple Threat SAT Prep Course.\nBest wishes to you! We know you'll continue to be COMPETENT, CONFIDENT, and STRATEGIC in all your endeavors!\nJehuti, a 2010 Westlake HS grad, became Nsoromma's first National Achievement Scholar and earned the highest SAT score in his graduating class! He recently graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering from North Carolina A&T State University and is working as an engineer.\nThe National Achievement Scholarship is given to academically outstanding African American students who are initially identified as Semi-finalists based on their PSAT scores in their junior year. During their senior year, they must must demonstrate a record of academic achievement, receive a recommendation from their school, and earn SAT scores that confirm their high PSAT scores.\nAlong with this honor comes scholarships, scholarships, and more scholarships from many sources! The National Merit Scholarship Corporation as well as colleges and other corporations give awards ranging from $2500 to full academic scholarships.\ntest scores each time he attended our Triple Threat SAT Test prep program -- in 10th grade and again in 11th grade.\nAfter graduating from Westlake, Justin enrolled at Morehouse College!\nBest wishes to you, Justin, for continued success!\nHow do our fees compare with other SAT Prep Courses?"

Listening to mothers' joyful tears as children were momentarily drowned.\nShe sat in the pew day after day, tasting. Tasting the putrid breath of the preacher when she sat in the front row. Tasting the weak and unsatisfying coffee that was handed to her as she walked in the door. Tasting the old grape juice and stale crackers that guaranteed she wouldn't be shunned by the old ladies in the corner. Tasting the blood on her tongue as she bit it, impatient to escape from the constricting white walls.\nShe sat in the pew day after day, seeing. Seeing the chipped, faded cross that hung crookedly on the wall; it seemed an unworthy representation of the story the preacher screamed so adamantly. Seeing her little brother squirm and get ungraciously smacked by her father. Seeing the smile on the preacher's wife's face that couldn't possibly be genuine; it couldn't hide the unsmiling, tired, empty eyes. Seeing the words \u201cBe thou my vision\u201d on a yellowed page and knowing that she would never see.\nShe sat in the pew day after day, feeling. Feeling the weight in the room that should've been freeing. Feeling the heaviness where there should be hope, the guilt where there should be grace, the hypocrisy where there should be sincerity. Feeling the constriction, the feeling of being confined. Feeling that she didn't belong and she would never belong. Feeling longing for the outside where the sun shone and the rain didn't drip but poured freely, and the violets' perfume wasn't sickening, and the only hypocrisy came from the dandelions who claimed to be flowers.\nFeeling the glares from her family and the old ladies in the corner, the shock from the preacher's wife, and the fury from the preacher as she stood up during one of his fire-and-brimstone rants and ran from the room, through the door, and out into the sunlight. She didn't belong there and she never would. She couldn't find Jesus in a crumbling off-white shed. Maybe she would never find Jesus.

It seemed to shift and realign, jump-starting my true consciousness as if I\u2019d been running on autopilot, but was now finally in control. Everything changed in the blink of an eye\u2026I felt whole. At least more \u201cmyself\u201d than I had since the others found me.\nFor a brief moment, among the torrent of feelings and memories flooding my mind, I thought the old me might resurface, too. \u201cI think I\u2019m\u2014\u201d Getting my memories back? It was almost too much to hope for.\nAs my mind spun, so did the onslaught of conflicting emotions\u2014too random and unrecognizable to have been my own.\n\u201cDani,\u201d I breathed. My eyes met hers, and I used the comfort I found in them as my anchor amid the impressions of foreign lifetimes competing for space in my mind. \u201cSomething\u2019s\u2026not right.\u201d Dizziness enveloped me, and I gripped Dani\u2019s arm more tightly, automatically reaching for Jason, too.\nImages of Jason and Dani flickered in my head, but instead of trying to push them away, I let them come, vivid and countless as they were.\nWith what felt like a breath of life, I inhaled, and everything in my mind\u2019s eye sharpened. As unsteady as I felt, the clarity brought a sense of relief I hadn\u2019t expected, and the dark recesses of my mind filled with colors and shapes and sounds\u2014recollections of the past. Dani and Jason\u2019s pasts, but not mine.\nI could feel her guilt, and I shook my head, only vaguely aware of why she felt that way. Dani\u2019s concern replaced my confusion, her curiosity and hope quickly following. Although I didn\u2019t necessarily understand the onslaught, I welcomed it. Everything I saw\u2014everything I felt\u2014was new and unexplored; my mind, once an empty cave, suddenly housed echoes of the past, assembling them into an irrefutable truth that seemed to lighten the darkness and partially fill the lingering void inside me.\nBut as abruptly as the emotions assaulted me, they vanished, and I felt empty again\u2014the images and feelings were nothing more than fading memories.\nHe exchanged a skeptical glance with Dani. \u201cYeah?\u201d he said, sounding unsure.\nJason frowned. \u201cWell\u2026it\u2019s your choice,\u201d he mumbled, and although he seemed baffled, he nodded.\nIn an instant, another flurry of guilt, frustration, and despair swirled around in my mind. I blinked, once again focusing on Dani as memories and feelings poured out of her. Like a camera shutter opening and closing, I saw Dani for the first time. Yes, she was a fiery, red-haired pixie with bright green eyes and a seemingly carefree nature, but she also felt lost and afraid and confused. I could feel everything\u2014her undeniable love for Jason, and the relentless shadow of a not-too-long-ago broken heart. Inexplicably, I shared her longing to see the woman who\u2019d raised her, her grandma who was gone, and her yearning to speak with her one last time. And then I saw an image of the dead little girl, haunting Dani and flooding her with guilt.\nMy best friend, who I only knew from her coalescing memories and our stilted conversations over the past week, stood in front of me, and now I understood why she seemed to cry at the drop of a hat. Her emotions were so raw, rampant, and fierce that they almost brought tears to my eyes.\nEnthralled by the insight I felt bringing me closer to Dani, I vaguely registered Jason walking away.\n\u201cZo?\u201d Dani\u2019s hand rested on my shoulder, sending acute waves of anxiety and eagerness rippling through me. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d Her voice teetered between panic and remorse, and I could feel the questions practically jumping off her tongue. She was hoping that my memories had returned, but felt guilty for thinking it, and she was worried she\u2019d accidently and irrevocably hurt me.\n\u201cLike you can feel what I\u2019m feeling?\u201d A burst of apprehension flared inside her.\nDani eyed me curiously, her fingers stroking the sling cradling her injured arm.\nDani\u2019s eyes widened as fear replaced her curiosity, and the jumble of images focused, a tumultuous memory flashing prominently through her mind.\nDani stood in a stark office, a perfectly organized desk separating her from Dr. Wesley, who was sitting behind it.\nAnother more vivid memory immediately followed.\nDani shook her head, so much hurt and anger filling her that she could barely speak. \u201cZo and Jason might blame themselves for everyone\u2019s deaths if they knew about you, but I don\u2019t. I blame you,\u201d she seethed and stormed to the door.\nThe memory faded, leaving in its place violent emotions tangled in my gut, nearly bringing me to my knees.\nDr. Wesley is my mom\u2026 I\u2019d completely forgotten that.\nI hedged. \u201cBut she\u2019s our mom, Dani. He\u2019ll be furious if we don\u2019t tell him, won\u2019t he?\u201d Lacking any tangible connection to Jason, I still wanted to do what was right, and I\u2019d seen enough of his silent tantrums in her memories to know this instance would be no exception.\n\u201cShe\u2019s your mom and she killed nearly everyone to keep you guys safe.\u201d Dani closed her eyes and took a deep breath, her eyes pleading when she reopened them. \u201cPlease, Zo. Don\u2019t say anything. He\u2019s not ready. Can\u2019t you see\u2026can\u2019t you feel it?\u201d Dani\u2019s acute panic and desperation were nearly overwhelming.\nRough laughter startled me, and I glanced over to the cart to see Jason and Carlos chatting as they sat on the bench, whittling. Although I had the impression that Jason wouldn\u2019t want me to pry around inside his head, I needed to; I needed to understand why Dani was so adamant to keep the truth from him.\nFocusing beyond her swirling emotions, I searched for Jason\u2019s. While Dani\u2019s were easy to access, an invisible wall surrounded Jason\u2019s, cold and excruciatingly controlled. I focused harder. It was difficult with Dani so close, her emotions so intense, but I could see and feel just enough from Jason to understand. There had been too much heartache, and too many lies and surprises to unleash another tumultuous mess on him while he was already so distraught.\nLike he could somehow sense my cerebral intrusion, Jason stopped whittling for a moment and glanced over at me. The instant his knowing eyes met mine, the invisible wall protecting his mind solidified, blocking me out completely.\nStanding there, with only a brief impression of who he was fresh in my mind, I felt closer to him than I probably ever would have had my Ability remained dormant. And I understood; Dani was right. Learning that our mom was still alive, that she\u2019d made the choice to leave when Jason was a young child, and that she\u2019d been the cause of so much death would devastate him, especially while the real me wasn\u2019t around to help bear the weight of the discovery.\nDani clutched my hand, silently pleading with me to keep quiet as Jason glanced between us.\nWith a quick squeeze in return, I reassured her of my silence, at least for a while.\nHarper and Chris emerged from the nearest cluster of trees, chatting amiably as they made their way back to camp with armfuls of firewood. When Harper\u2019s eyes found mine, his relaxed expression tensed, and he hurried over to us.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said, waving his concern away. There was nothing like a resurgence of forgotten memories and pitying glances to make me feel like the most pathetic woman in the world.\nAs I took a few steps toward Harper and Chris, I stumbled, the bombardment of their worries, memories, and emotions throwing me off kilter. Dropping his armful of firewood, Harper jogged the final few steps between us to lend me a supporting hand.\nI snickered. Yep, I\u2019m pathetic.\n\u201cSo, Jason\u2019s not\u2026\u201d Chris glanced over at my brother. \u201cA little advanced notice would\u2019ve been nice,\u201d she grumbled, though I didn\u2019t really understand her spike of irritation.\n\u201cIt was an accident,\u201d Dani chimed in, sounding tired. She patted Wings\u2019s neck. \u201cI\u2019ll send Wings and Shadow out to pasture with the other horses, then head over and warn\u201d\u2014Dani\u2019s gaze flicked to me, and her cheeks reddened as shame emanated from her\u2014\u201ctell the others.\u201d After a brief moment, the sound of lazy, clomping hooves retreated behind me.\nHarper helped me over to lean against a lone tree trunk growing along the edge of the pond. His memories and feelings resonated within me, and I mentally waded through the streaming information, effortlessly absorbing pieces of who he was. He was so good and confident and calm; I couldn\u2019t help but admire him.\n\u201cYou sure you\u2019re alright, Baby Girl?\u201d he asked, scanning me as I gripped the trunk of the tree.\n\u201cYeah. I\u2019m okay, really.\u201d I blushed at being the center of unwanted attention.\nWith a pat on my shoulder, Chris excused herself and headed over to join Jason and Carlos. I hadn\u2019t missed her and Harper\u2019s silent, charged exchange before she walked away. Their growing connection was impossible to miss, especially when I could feel their mutual attraction.\nHarper glanced over at Chris\u2019s retreating form, appraising her covertly, or so he thought. When he noticed me eyeing him, he smiled, a knowing glint in his peridot-colored eyes.\n\u201cInteresting,\u201d I said, eyebrows raised in amusement.\nHe nudged my shoulder with his. \u201cYou see too much,\u201d he said and waggled his eyebrows.\nI knew that was true, so all I could do was shrug. \u201cI\u2019m still learning how to navigate this whole Ability thing,\u201d I said.\n\u201cAnd in the meantime, you\u2019ll all avoid me like I\u2019m a leper?\u201d I asked acerbically. Being bitter wouldn\u2019t help, but it was hard not to be when people were suddenly running as far away from me as possible, despite their smiles.\n\u201cI sure hope so,\u201d I muttered.\nTavis\u2019s laughter rumbled on the faint breeze, and I could hear him and Sam bantering back and forth. After a quick glance around, I spotted them walking along the other side of the reservoir, water jugs in their hands. The still water began to ripple, and I realized I hadn\u2019t noticed the wind pick up.\nI smiled as they drew closer. Their companionable chatter was familiar, the one feeling I yearned for the most. I welcomed the sense of comfort that came with the sounds of their voices.\n\u201cAs if!\u201d Tavis said with half a laugh.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I was thinking,\u201d Sam said."

                            "text": "Matt\u2019s passion for love for the fantastic inspired him to write his debut novel, The Chosen of the Light. At a staggering 400,000 words, Matt was forced to split his novel up into three books, the first of which,Spirit Summoner, is due later in 2013. He lives in Western Washington with his wife, Jen, and son, Jacobi.\nHow would you describe Spirit Summoner: The Chosen of the Light\u2019s protagonist, Darr? Can you tell us three things about him that you won\u2019t find in the book?\nDarr has an ability that allows him to hear the voices of the spirits, an ability that many liken to a handicap. He\u2019s comfortable enough with his abilities and his control over them to live a perfectly normal life, but he lives wanting to know more about the power that can leave him disabled at times. Once he discovers the true power at his fingertips, he finds himself way in over his head.\nDarr loves exploring the country around his home, he\u2019s fascinated with Ictarian history and geography, and well, let\u2019s just say he has a long story ahead of him.\nNow tell us three things about yourself that we won\u2019t find on your website.\nI\u2019m pretty open about myself on my website, but here it goes. I love playing with Legos. The absolute worst food I ever ate was macaroni & cheese mixed with cooked (canned) spinach. My all-time favorite gift came as a complete surprise from my best friend\u2026it was a full size replica for the Buster Sword from Final Fantasy VII.\nWhat characteristics / interests / personality traits do you share in common with Darr?\nDarr and I share a thirst for exploration, but for both of us, this is a double-edged sword. As great as it is to explore, it takes you away from home.\nAnother important trait we share are the techniques we use to calm and focus ourselves. I learned deep breathing techniques in college to help with stress and mood changes, techniques Darr uses to keep himself separated from the spirit world.\nHow did you come up with the Spirit Summoner, the Sephirs and the Devoid? Are these unique takes on mythological entities or did you create them from scratch?\nThe Sephirs have always been the most fascinating to me because they\u2019re based off the classical four elements. Of course, it only seems natural to have a person who can harness these elements. Enter the Spirit Summoner and the Devoid, two entities who can control the elements and who can do so for very different reasons. I always try to stress how fragile the line between good and evil can be.\nWho are some of your favorite authors? What genres do you like to read?\nI tend to read within the fantasy genre because that\u2019s what interests me. I try not to limit myself to my sub-genre though. I loved Stephen King\u2019s Dark Tower series, and Chuck Palahniuk\u2019s Lullaby. Both authors are great storytellers of the fantastic.\nWhen you are not writing, reading or working, what do you do to refresh and relax?\nA have a few different hobbies I bounce between. Reading comics, woodworking in the shop and at home, and going for bike rides are all great fun. However, none of them holds a candle to a good RPG video game. I love games with deeply involved stories.\nEvery night since the Archon\u2019s departure, Darr had gone into the Currents and searched for him. He tried calling out to the spirit creature, but his voice didn\u2019t carry in the Currents like it did in the physical world. One other option remained, but the thought of it terrified him.\nDarr chewed at his lower lip and stared across the room at Erec and Jinn. The bright flame of a candle danced on the table beside the bed, sending up shadows across the walls. Jinn glanced over at him with a questioning look.\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you thinking, Darr?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cGone. Where are you going?\u201d Erec asked with skepticism thick in his voice.\n\u00ad\u00ad\u2026he entered the Currents in a smooth, soundless rush.\nThe wisteria light of the spirit realm spread out before him, laced with the blues and yellows, reds and greens of the Four Elements. The beauty of the place radiated so much awe it made him want to cry. His brother and sister were there, mirrored by the Light giving them life. Darr wanted to reach out and touch them, to feel what they were feeling, but he resisted the temptation.\nHe quieted his mind and expanded his senses further, yet another lesson he\u2019d learned from Racall. In doing so, the forms of Erec and Jinn receded into the wisteria light, leaving him alone with the fuzzballs of illumination that were the spirits. They danced and swirled all about him, their voices faint and indistinct. Darr prepared to reach out to them. How should he address them?\nThe voices startled him. Racall had taught him how to shut out their voices until he was ready to hear them. Somehow, his preparations had failed.\n\u201cHello,\u201d Darr greeted, though he remained wary.\nThe spirits swirled around him, their listless forms coalescing all about his insubstantial body.\nA faint tugging sensation pulled at Darr\u2019s mind, a warning perhaps. Emotions welled up inside him, and he fought to push them down. He couldn\u2019t panic now.\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for the Archon of Earth. Where can I find him?\u201d Darr asked.\nThe spirits began to spin madly about him. Fragmented images tumbled into Darr\u2019s mind. Mountains and trees and shooting blades of grass. Boulders rose out of rich soil and flowers and other plants sprouted from choking overgrowth. He saw rotting tree trunks fresh with green moss, and rockslides plunging down mountains, flattening grasses and trees only to renew them.\nDarr gasped in shock. In all of these images, he saw Racall. The spirits were showing him the ways in which Racall spread the magic of his Sephir out across Ictar, his physical presence by the loosest definition. The Summoner struggled against the images flooding into his head, trying to find an end to the web the spirits wove into his own Light. The images didn\u2019t stop, they increased in intensity and frequency. Darr\u2019s emotions rose to the surface.\nThe spirits didn\u2019t hear him. The white pinpricks of light came swarming out of the ether. They touched him, weaving their minuscule bodies in and out of his own Light, a repulsive sensation. They were feeding off his emotions, and in turn, he began to feed off theirs. The memories and emotions of the spirits poured through his mind and soul, and in doing so, he had difficulty remembering anything about himself.\nThe calming hue of the Currents, and the spinning white lights of the spirits, were all he was aware of. He could barely remember why he\u2019d come here. Did he have a family? Did he have a purpose? What was his name?\nHe froze. Something clicked in his mind, a tugging sensation. The spirits closed in tight, choking off his suspicions. Something was wrong, but he\u2019d fallen too far into the Currents to figure it out. He couldn\u2019t even remember his own name. Yet, another name had been preserved in the depths of his mind, a name he knew would free him. But he mustn\u2019t speak it. He must will it.\nA jolt of certainty coursed through him as he uttered the name, an utterance he made with only his Light. The spirits crowded over him in mad defiance, but their efforts were in vain. Wisteria light gave way to green and a massive shape exploded between the Summoner and the spirits. The ethereal forms scattered in every direction across the Currents. Darr\u2019s memories cascaded down into his head, returning him to himself. First and foremost, he heard Racall\u2019s lesson that the spirits were not to be trifled with for they would make him one of them.\nRacall\u2019s broad shape materialized out of the green light, reflecting a number of emotions Darr didn\u2019t know the Archon possessed, worry and relief.\n\u201cI hope you have learned a valuable lesson, young Reintol,\u201d he said in the familiar harmonized voice.\nRacall motioned towards a light spot in the spirit realm. The forms of Erec and Jinn appeared before them, their Lights unchanged since Darr began his journey into the Currents.\nSpirit Summoner is available in paperback at Amazon and Barnes & Noble.com. Kindle, Nook, and most other ebook formats also available."

                            "text": "Arno Schmidt\u2019s 1970 novel Bottom\u2019s Dream is finally available in English translation by John E. Woods. The book has been published by the Dalkey Archive.\nAs you can see in the picture above: Enormous.\nBut what\u2019s Bottom\u2019s Dream about? (This is the wrong question).\nThe novel begins around 4 AM on Midsummer\u2019s Day 1968 in the L\u00fcneburg Heath in northeastern Lower Saxony in northern Germany, and concludes twenty-five hours later. It follows the lives of 54-year-old Daniel Pagenstecher, visiting translators Paul Jacobi and his wife Wilma, and their 16-year-old daughter Franziska. The story is concerned with the problems of translating Edgar Allan Poe into German and with exploring the themes he conveys, especially regarding sexuality.\nDid I mention that it\u2019s enormous?\nLook, I know that dwelling on a book\u2019s size probably has nothing to do with literary criticism, but Bottom\u2019s Dream poses something of a special case. As an article on Bottom\u2019s Dream at The Wall Street Journal points out, Schmidt\u2019s opus is 1,496 pages long, contains over 1.3 million words, and weighs 13 pounds.\nIt\u2019s a physical challenge as well as a mental challenge.\nAnd, Oh that mental challenge!\nHmmm\u2026? What do you think?\nThe obvious easy reference point here is Joyce\u2019s Finnegans Wake, which indeed Schmidt was actively following, both in form and style: competing columns, a fragmentary and elusive/allusive style, collage-like metacommentary, an etymological explosion\u2014words as paint, text as meaning. Etc.\nI\u2019ll never forget one of my graduate school professors warning us not to \u201cpeer too long into Finnegans Wake.\u201d He called it an abyss. (The man loved Joyce\u2019s work, by the way, and had studied under Hugh Kenner. I\u2019m not sure if he meant abyss pejoratively. It was, like I say, a warning).\nAfter nine days, I\u2019m \u201con\u201d page 21 of Schmidt\u2019s novel now, and I have no idea what\u2019s going on. And not just because it\u2019s a primal gobbledygook wordmass. No, part of my incomprehension results from a very strong physical reaction to \u201creading\u201d Bottom\u2019s Dream. This physical reaction goes beyond the size of the volume\u2014although there\u2019s certainly something to the size. I more or less have to read the thing on my dining room table; it\u2019s dreadfully uncomfortable on a couch, and probably impossible on my hammock or in the bathtub. I can\u2019t really hold it while I read it. I think this matters, although I can\u2019t really say how right now. The multiple columns, marginalia, images, etc. are engaging but also fragment my attention\u2014and I generally find myself flicking through Bottom\u2019s Dream, rather than sustaining the will to follow the \u201cplot.\u201d Right now, anyway, I find myself wrapped up in the aesthetics of reading Bottom\u2019s Dream. It\u2019s a tactile read. I enjoy it most when I smooth my hands over it, jump out of the stream, 20, 30, 100 pages forward, backwards. Relax a little.\nOtherwise, Bottom\u2019s Dream becomes a bit of a nightmare for me: I get all dizzy, thirsty, my eyes seem to thrum. Something going on in the inner-ear. It\u2019s like a slow-motion panic attack. When that abyss-stress comes on, I jump ahead.\nYes! Poe\u2019s >swirlpools<! >intoxication o\u2019r dizziness<! \u2014 there\u2019s a description for me of my own reaction to reading Bottom\u2019s Dream.\nPoe might be something of a guide for me if I do try to stick out wandering through Bottom\u2019s Dream, and his story \u201cA Descent into the Maelstrom,\u201d referenced above, seems a particularly nice parallel to Schmidt\u2019s bigass book.\n\u201cDescent\u201d relates the tale of a sailor (a voyager!\u2013a, like, metaphorical reader, y\u2019know) transformed by his encounter with the \u201cMoskoestrom\u201d \u2014a swirling abyss from which no one returns. This vortex, \u201cabsurd and unintelligible,\u201d breaks the sailor, \u201cbody and soul.\u201d He can\u2019t comprehend the storm. It\u2019s unknowable, un-nameable. At best, he is able to make a sidelong glance at it, but can never plumb its depths. And not only is his glance broken, but all of his senses are fragmented. He escapes the maelstrom, but is unrecognizable to the sailors who rescue him. He becomes the voice of the vortex, the metonymy of a force he can perceive but can\u2019t comprehend.\nThe maelstrom\u2014the vortex, the abyss\u2014this, for Poe, was language.\nI\u2019m not sure how deep I\u2019ll travel into Schmidt\u2019s maelstrom. I managed large sections of Finnegans Wake\u2014but I had a guide in Joseph Campbell\u2019s Skeleton Key. Someone to map out the terrain, show me the ropes, etc.\nObviously, there isn\u2019t much English-language scholarship on Bottom\u2019s Dream right now (and in a very real and radical sense that I\u2019m not touching on here, Woods\u2019s translation is its own separate book). There are a few blogs taking on Schmidt\u2019s monster though. The Untranslated has been writing (in English) about the original German text for over a year now. At Messenger\u2019s Booker, Tony Messenger has been writing about Woods\u2019s translation. There might be some other folks out there attempting the same\u2014if you know let me know. For now, my updates from this maelstrom will be sporadic at best."

Due to Susan, no doubt. It was hot outside, yet walking inside it was like walking into a wall. A wall of despair and horror. A prison. His own personal version of hell. A hell he could not escape \u2013 a hell which consisted of the nearly crippling pain in his chest. Of the vision of Percy's eyes, filled with anger and hatred, with distrust and betrayal.\nHe wondered if he'd ever get the image out of his mind. If he'd ever be able to forgive himself for the pain he'd caused.\nHad it been a mistake?\nNo! He couldn't believe that. He would perish if he thought that. He'd needed to protect Percy, even if it caused him pain. Hopefully, one day Percy would understand, if not forgive. No he didn't think Percy would ever forgive. Nor would he trust again. But perhaps that was a good thing? It would keep him out of danger.\nAnd still, he wanted nothing more than for Percy to be happy. Safe, yes, but too late he realised it wasn't enough. He wanted him happy. He wanted him to trust, to smile, to\u2026 No, he just wanted him.\nThat was over now though, and he would have to live with that. The consequences of his mistakes. They seemed to be piling up on him.\nThe noise of the door clicking shut behind him seemed impossibly loud, as if someone had slammed a door in his face \u2013 again. He hardly noticed dropping the bag where he stood, or going up the creaky, carpet clad stairs, or opening the door to his bedroom or collapsing on his bed. In his mind there were only the images he'd put there himself. The images of his future dying.\nHe didn't even know who the woman was. Just someone he'd picked up, he didn't remember nor cared about her name and if she ran into him again she would not know him.\nObliviation. A crime. And yet one he'd done without regret. She would never remember meeting him today, or coming with him home, or being used to stage the one scene that would make Percy throw him out, the one scene Percy would not be able to forget or forgive.\nPercy never had shared well.\nMost importantly she would never remember Percy. Would never remember recognising the head of the Auror departmeant. That at least was a small consolation. Percy \u2013 his job \u2013 his career \u2013 was still safe. That thought alone kept him from breaking apart completely. And yet, what was that thought to the sight of the look in Percy's eyes? The pain, the horror, the disappointment and betrayal.\nHe'd hit the one nerve Percy had, the one insecurity he couldn't let go of. That one day he'd not be enough. As if he could ever not be enough. Yet right now Percy was most likely in his private version of hell too, not knowing what had changed, why he'd gone from coming home to a man who loved him to the sight of the man he loved in the arms of a strange woman.\nWould he ever be all right again? If he knew the truth, perhaps? But no, he could not tell Percy the truth. At least not until his mother was either safe or \u2013 his worst fear \u2013 dead. Then he'd make sure Percy knew, though he was not sure he'd listen. In either case, he was sure it would not change anything. The images would still be in Percy's mind, just as they would in Cass'. There would be no second chances, no going back, no changing what had happened.\nIt was too late. Too late too fast and as necessary as he tried to convince himself this was, the mere thought of that made him groan in pain as he curled up on himself, his arms wrapped around his knees. In his heart there was a rip he knew would never heal, a fresh bleeding wound that he could only hope he'd learn to live with. He tried to hold onto what had been, the perfect days in Italy, the everyday life in the house, yet every memory felt bitter sweet. Every memory brought a fresh waive of pain over him as he knew it was over, that he'd never more get to look into Percy's eyes right after they'd kissed, that he'd never again would sleep with the weight of Percy's head on his shoulder.\nIt was lost. All of it. Everything that mattered. It was just him. Him and the stabbing pain in his chest. Alone. Lonely. Empty."

He realized that this was an aftereffect of draining his mental spirit.\n\u2019\u2019Concentration\u2019\u2019 was also connected to \u2019\u2019mental spirit,\u2019\u2019 so using it up would affect his mental acuteness. Seiji could feel a tangible difference now that his mental spirit was depleted.\nEnergy and mental spirit... perhaps they were the equivalents of HP and MP, but it was rather inconvenient that Seiji was unable to view a physical stat for these two values.\nNaturally, the system didn't respond.\nAfter making those comments to himself, Seiji lazily stretched before standing up.\nAn ordinary and peaceful school life awaited him.\nEverything that occurred yesterday happened in the course of a single day, but it seemed to take a lot longer than that.\n\u2019\u2019Heh heh, Seigo...\u2019\u2019 The tomboy grinned evilly as she approached him.\nA peaceful and joyous daily life was indeed the best... right?\nAfter classes had ended in the afternoon.\nSeiji received a text message during lunch break, so he headed for the student council office at this time.\nNatsuya Yoruhana's expression was serious as she placed a leather briefcase in front of Seiji.\n\u2019\u2019The talismans are inside?\u2019\u2019 Seiji took the briefcase and tested its weight.\nFrom what Seiji could see, the student council president seemed rather haggard compared to her normal appearance. Her pale complexion added a different touch to her beauty;she now seemed weak and lovely.\nShe was probably fatigued from creating such a large amount of talismans.\nThe beautiful missus' smile in her slightly weakened state was a sight to behold.\n'This smile was definitely worth the trip!' Seiji praised it in his heart.\nSeiji finally left the student council room.\nThe leather briefcase filled with talismans wasn't heavy at all.\nBut as he thought about what they signified, Seiji felt the briefcase's weight increase.\nAfter he delivered the briefcase, the strengthening of the detection spell would begin. After that, the attempt to stop the enemy's Spirit-branded Retainer would begin, and Hitaka Shuho would do battle with the Snow Girl.\nA battle between Spirit-branded Retainers... how would that look like? And what would the result be?\nSeiji didn't have a strong impression of Hitaka Shuho. After all, he'd only met her twice, and the red-haired girl had always acted cold towards him. They'd barely exchanged any words, but still... she was someone he knew;someone he'd shared tea together with.\nWhat was she like as a Spirit-branded Retainer? Would she be injured, or even... die in battle against the enemy?\nThis upcoming Yin Yang Master duel could have possible repercussions for the entire school. The duel would begin soon, and he knew what would happen, but he couldn't predict the result.\nSeiji left school carrying the leather briefcase.\nHe didn't notice that a pair of eyes were watching him from afar.\n\u2019\u2019Seigo Harano...\u2019\u2019 a voice softly spoke his name, and the sound quickly dissipated into the wind.\nThe leather briefcase was successfully delivered to the Juumonji group.\nMichirou Juumonji's expression was grave as he received the briefcase and promised that he would handle the talismans carefully.\nJust like last time, Seiji politely rejected the invitation to eat dinner with the Juumonji family.\nAlso, just like last time, Michirou didn't insist. His eyes flashed with an enigmatic light as he politely said goodbye.\nOne time didn't mean much, but for this to happen twice... Seiji felt something was slightly abnormal. Not because of Michirou not insisting on dinner, but because of Michirou's strange attitude!\nIt didn't seem like malice or a plot of some sort, and it was difficult to describe.\nHe didn't understand it at all.\nSeiji was too lazy to think more deeply into Michirou's motives.\nHe didn't expect that he wouldn't need to think about it anymore, since he would learn about it soon!\nHe had only rested inside for a minute when he heard a knock on his door.\n'Is it Mika?' Seiji stood up and opened the door.\nHe was greeted by the sight of a beautiful girl with curly blonde hair, sky-blue eyes, and a delicate appearance smiling at him brightly. The girl wore a light blue one-piece dress and exuded a seemingly gentle aura.\nPlease take good care... what the hell!?\n\u2019\u2019Yep, this is a moving-in present for you. My dear neighbor, please don't mind this insignificant present and receive it.\u2019\u2019 The blonde girl held out an exquisitely packaged cake towards Seiji.\nThat's right;this gentle blonde beauty happened to be the daughter of Michirou Juumonji, who he had just talked to. She was a mafia boss's daughter!\nIt sounded quite normal, but that wasn't the problem!\n\u2019\u2019My apologies for this being a low-class apartment.\u2019\u2019 Nozomi Uehara suddenly appeared out of nowhere and let out a sigh.\n\u2019\u2019Harano-kun, you don't need to try and explain;this isn't a high-class apartment anyways.\u2019\u2019 Nozomi didn't seem to mind too much as she looked at the blonde-haired girl and continued, \u2019\u2019That's why I was curious as well: why would a beauty like Juumonji-san who is accustomed to a comfortable life want to live here? I asked her this question already.\nThe landlord's amber eyes, which bore a strong resemblance to Mika's, blinked repeatedly and shone with a curious light."

This defence did not sit well with the judge who said \u201cwhatever that means\u201d. The judge also noted that there was no evidence that might otherwise explain what looked like a routinely executed guarantee was not what it seemed to be. By now you would have guessed the judge\u2019s decision - that the guarantor was liable and he had to honour the guarantee.\nThis case dealt with a number of complex legal issues but this aspect of the case is easy to understand. The moral of the story is this \u2013 providing a guarantee is serious business. Financiers often require the directors of a company borrower (SMEs as well as big corporations) to give personal guarantees before providing finance for business purposes. It will be wise for a guarantor to seek independent legal advice (and perhaps independent financial advice too) before entering into a guarantee. And the courts are probably not going to be sympathetic to a guarantor who tries to escape his or her obligations, especially when the basis of the defence is unrelated to the authenticity of the signature but a technicality regarding the manner in which the signature was witnessed.\nContact us if you need advice on going guarantor."

Lounging now, with his head resting on his arm which was resting along the back of the couch he wasn't quite sure things even had gone wrong.\nHe tugged at the waist of his trousers, grimacing a little from the ache that had settled in his belly. As much from the alcohol as it was from the sharp pressure of his too tight belt digging into his hips and stomach. And as much from what he'd actually just said to Jayne... had he?... as either of those two things.\nHe pulled again at his belt, shifting uncomfortably and wishing he'd just worn suspenders like everyone else seemed to.\nHe glanced, cautiously at Jayne, and then quickly averted his gaze when he found the other man still blinking owlishly.\n\"Sorry... it slipped out...\" He muttered sluggishly, making to stand before he felt a warm hand settle heavily on his bare forearm and a rush of heat spread through him like wildfire.\nChills and then fever- I think this patient may be in a world of trouble.\nHe gazed dumbly at the place where skin met skin and then followed the curve of wrist up the tightly strung cords under taut skin to well-muscled biceps and finally found that bowed, too-tan neck before staring into the devilishly grinning face of Jayne Cobb.\nWe've lost the rhythm! Clear!\n\"Care to repeat that, Doc?\"\nThe slighter man drew back quickly to escape that touch. Curse the man! How could he do it? He'd had double what Simon could ever dream to drink. \"Err... that is to say... N-no?\" He stammered hopefully before glaring down at the giggling children that were huddled on the floor in front of them, adoring their town's hero.\nSitting on their knees, kneeling like a bunch of... kneelers. He glared again half-heartedly, since the first glare was met only with more snickering, before giving up.\nJayne chuckled at his embarrassment before seeming to take pity on the man and mock-growling in their direction. Jerking forward towards the rugrats not really meaning to stand, but sending them scattering with shrieks of terrified delight anyway.\nHe settled back in his seat again, too close for his fidgeting companion's comfort, and took a long draw from the bottle he was holding. Holding with the same long, work-calloused fingers that had been holding Simon's arm a few minutes previous... Oh God, he needed another drink. And to be knocked out, just for good measure.\n\"Now... what was it we were discussin'? Oh yeah,\" He raised his dark eyes again to catch Simon's own and the doctor found himself lost in the inky depths.\nOh God, he really needed a drink... and unconsciousness- mustn't forget that... though not necessarily in that order.\nOops, the great Jayne Cobb was speaking again, \"-about to tell me what exactly you meant by 'pretty'.\"\nSimon scrubbed his face with his hands before running them raggedly through his hair and letting them rest, useless, in his lap.\nOh. Yeah. Things had gone terribly wrong... and that would be where it happened. He had been bragging about all the great medical feats he'd performed with his own two hands- he paused in thought to glare accusingly at the currently idle fingers which had so nimbly aided him in the past- even had enough liquor in him to tell Jayne about the hamster Kessian Phelps had named after him, earning some offhanded comment about hamsters being 'good eatin'. Had not thought there was enough alcohol on all the numerous worlds he had been on to get him to admit his feelings to Jayne Cobb.\nJayne. Cobb. Jayne \"Psychotic Gun-slinger\" Cobb. Jayne \"Proud Owner of Vera\" Cobb. Jayne \"Savior of the Town\" Cobb. Box-dropping, man-ape-gone-wrong Jayne Cobb. Jayne \"Sitting Right in Front of Him and Looking Damned Amused that He'd Been Called Pretty\" Cobb.\nHe really wished he could pass out from alcohol poisoning right now.\nHe must've glared at his hands just a bit longer than he'd intended, because when he looked up again Jayne was wearing the same mischievous grin he always did, but he seemed to have moved closer somehow. Huh. Wondered how he'd missed that.\n\"If you're going to kill me, can we at least make it quick?\" He implored meekly.\nJayne leaned over even closer, Simon sinking back to accommodate him and losing his breath at the proximity. The rifleman was so close now he could smell every scent he'd always imagined there was. Whiskey, the good stuff. The hard peppermint candies he'd always 'procured' from Preacher's stash when he thought no one was looking. And something deeper and earthy... something... Jayne.\nJayne's arm settled around the back of the couch they shared, resting against the curve of Simon's shoulders and sending another spark of heat through him.\n\"No one said nothin' 'bout killin' you, Doc.\" His fingers brushed against one tensed shoulder, causing Simon to start under him and frantically wonder what people watching would think.\nHe supposed if someone glanced at them from behind, they would see two close friends, sharing a story or some such notion. Were it not for the fact that their savior's face was looming scant inches above his and that his fingers were gently, gently go figure, kneading the shoulder they now rested on.\nSimon broke into a sudden sweat when Jayne began lowering his head and he was certain the room's temperature had jumped at least twenty degrees, because he was sweltering. He pulled his head back into the cushion a bit, causing Jayne to pause.\n\"Th-this isn't appropriate. Really, Jayne.\" He pushed weakly at the massive body that seemed to be towering over him, while said body snorted in amusement.\n\"Hell, Doc, I prob'ly can't even spell that damn word, right? 'Member,\" he leaned in closer, roughly brushing their lips together, \"Man-ape gone wrong yer reasonin' with.\"\nWhen he said it there was nothing but humor there, and Simon was too shocked by the... kiss? to think of any witty reply. So Jayne took it as his leave to really kiss the man.\nAs a surprisingly skillful tongue slipped into the recesses of his mouth, Simon closed his eyes, gripped the broad shoulders above him, and signed his mind out for the rest of the night.\nPropriety be damned. He finally had the man right where he wanted him- or rather, was right where he wanted to be. He'd feel awful about drinking too much and being inappropriate and using the word 'damned', even if just in his head, in the morning."

That is not to say he was unaffected by her. Quite the contrary. All these years he had told himself that he despised her. Yet when he saw her sitting there, it was rather like a wallop to his chest.\nMost shocking of all, she still bore her maiden name.\nThough she looked much older, he found her more desirable than she'd been as a debutante. There was a womanly curvature about her he found most alluring. Her hair was the same shade of rich brown, but it seemed more radiant than ever. And it wasn\u2019t just because there were diamonds in it. Her complexion was as milky as he remembered, and the pink in her cheeks made her looks angelic.\nA pity she was not.\nShe was in want of a heart. Miss Annabelle Lippincott had promised to wed him, but when he met with her father to ask for her hand, he'd been informed she'd had decided to marry another. She hadn't even bothered to tell him face to face.\nHer eyes, still such a brilliant blue, had regarded him icily. That one glare told him all he needed to know. There had been times in the past decade when he had made excuses for her abrupt betrayal, but any flickering hopes he\u2019d ever had of winning back her affections were instantly snuffed tonight.\nAs soon as he'd sat beside her, he'd drawn in her sweet lavender scent and was swamped with the powerful memories it evoked. With a hitch to his breath, he recalled the first time her fragrant lavender had destroyed his reserve. It was when they waltzed at the Richardsons' ball and he knew when his hand rested at her waist that he wanted to spend his life with the sweet-smelling girl.\nMore somberly, he recalled the last time he\u2019d been aware of her scent that night at Vauxhall, the night she told him she loved him and wanted to marry him. The lying she-devil.\nShe passed him the French sauce, and their hands briefly touched. He should have recoiled, but he was too affected by her to do so. Instead his gaze met hers. Those blasted eyes of hers had always sent his pulses thumping.\nThe pity of it was, in all these years nothing had changed. Year after year he had loathed her, and after one moment in her presence he felt like a wet youth just down from Cambridge.\nBut he wasn\u2019t a wet youth. He was a man of two-and-thirty years. He had learned the painful lesson that women were not to be trusted. And he wasn\u2019t about to fall back under this woman\u2019s spell."

His staff rests beside him, and a satchel lies at his feet. The shiny bald spot atop his head is ringed by stringy white hair hanging to his shoulders.\nNORTH: Head into the back corners of the Main Hall.\nUP: Head upstairs to the Overseer's Office.\nDOWN: Descend the stairs to the Subterranean floors."

                            "text": "DETROIT - Active member of the Underground Railroad, recruiter of Michigan's Colored Infantry, entrepreneur and one of Detroit's most impassioned and important black leaders, George DeBaptiste will be honored Nov. 12, 2018 at a brief Veterans Day memorial service at his gravesite -- Section C, Lot 24 -- at 12:30 p.m. at historic Elmwood Cemetery.\nUnder the auspices of the Detroit Association for the Study of African American Life and History (ASALH - Detroit), the service will include a wreath laying along with a presentation by 102nd USCT re-enactors.\nGenealogist, photojournalist and African-American military specialist Dale Rich will speak about DeBaptiste's life.\nBorn free in Fredricksburg, Va., in 1815, DeBaptiste learned the barber's trade as a boy, and became a kind of valet to a wealthy southerner, with whom he traveled extensively.\nAfter his move to Madison, Ind., DeBaptiste became acquainted with William Henry Harrison, who would become president of the United States. During Harrison's brief tenure. DeBaptiste, who was fond of Harrison, became a steward of the White House, attending to the president until the president's death.\nDeBaptiste and his wife returned to Madison where he opened a barbershop and began his deep involvement with the abolitionist movement. The Ohio River, which Madison overlooks, was a destination for runaway slaves because it was a boundary between free Indiana and slave-holding Kentucky. Responsible for the freedom of hundreds of slaves, DeBaptiste would sometimes walk 20 miles a night, often in pouring rain, to fetch freedom seekers hidden in boats, and set them on a path to Detroit and ultimately, Windsor, Ont. Come morning, he'd be back behind the barber chair, in which would frequently sit slaveholders themselves.\nIn 1846, following a virulent spate of anti-black violence, DeBaptiste fled Madison for Detroit. The city had an already established black community, including several black-owned businesses. During this time, DeBaptiste was, by turns, a baker, caterer, clothier, restaurateur and real estate holder.\nAgain, he would make his mark on the abolitionist front. He bought the steamship the T. Whitney, hired a white man to pilot it, and risked his life secretely ferrying freedom seekers to Canada.\nDuring this time, DeBaptiste served as a delegate to the Cleveland National Convention of Colored Citizens, as an agent for the Freedman's Aid Commission, and as a member of the Colored Vigilant Committee of Detroit.\nIn 1859, he was one of the chosen abolitionists to meet in Detroit with Frederick Douglass and John Brown to hear Brown's plans for armed rebellion at Harper's Ferry, West Virginia.\nDuring the Civil War, DeBaptiste helped to organized the First Michigan Colored Infantry, also known as the 102nd United States Colored Troops. DeBaptiste traveled all over Michigan recruiting. Named a sutler, he followed the regiment to its campaign in South Carolina.\nFollowing the war, DeBaptiste returned to his beloved Detroit. Having sold the steamboat, he dedicated most of his time to politics. On a local level, for example, he sought to put young black students on an equal footing with their white counterparts. On the national front, he worked for the passing of the 15th Amendment -- which prohibits the denial of citizens' right to vote -- and to the 13th Amendment, the abolition of slavery. By the time he died of stomach cancer in 1875, he'd seen both efforts come to fruition.\nA longtime mason who was twice married and had two surviving children, DeBaptiste is memorialized on a historical plaque on East Larned and Beaubien streets on his homesite.\nDeBaptiste was a leader of African-Americans in Detroit.\nElmwood Cemetery is at 1200 Elmwood St. in Detroit, 48207, near Calvary Baptist Church.\nThe Association for the Study of African American Life and History (ASALH.org) was founded in 1915by Carter G. Woodson, known as the father of black history. The organization is dedicated to the study and appreciation of African-American history."

Yet 20 years ago, the international community turned away as 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutu were killed within 100 days. Today the Montreal Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies at Concordia University stands with the people of Rwanda to remember those who lost their lives and support the survivors of this tragedy.\nAs we mark this sad anniversary, it is also our duty to reflect on lessons learned. The Rwandan genocide did not come out of nowhere \u2013 it was well planned and there were countless opportunities to prevent and stop it. Nobody can say we did not know. We did not act. As the on-going massacres in Syria, South Sudan and the Central African Republic prove, we still fail to act on the lessons of the Rwandan genocide and the other genocides of the past one hundred years. Generating the political will to prevent mass atrocities remains one of the central challenges today. But preventing genocide and mass atrocities is a collective responsibility.\nAnd so, as we pay tribute to the victims and survivors of the genocide, we must renew our commitment. In 2005, the 192 governments of the United Nations renewed their commitment to the \u201cresponsibility to protect.\u201d Canadian diplomats led the international community in mobilizing support for this emerging doctrine that seeks to break the cycle of choosing to look the other way when mass atrocities occur. Today, instead of standing on the sidelines, we urge the Prime Minister of Canada to enlarge this tradition by making mass atrocity prevention\u2014the prevention of genocide, crimes against humanity, and ethnic cleansing, in particular\u2014a national security priority and a vital part of Canada\u2019s foreign policy.\nFor more information, please visit the United Nations Office of the Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide.\nLGen the Hon.

                            "text": "Substituting for Pastor Jeremiah today is guest writer Ralph M.\nOne of the lines from the most recent Star Wars anthology film Solo that resonated with me today was delivered by Tobias Beckett (Woody Harrelson): \u201cAssume everyone will betray you, and you will never be disappointed.\u201d Indeed, in the final hours of Jesus\u2019 life, it was one sort of betrayal after another from His closest friends and apostles to the Jews who had the opportunity to first hear about the Gospel. In the hours of loneliness and darkness that His soul was heaving with, what was His antidote to that? It was prayer. Long hours of emotional, intimate prayer with God. It seems like after He was done with his marathon prayer, He faced His accusers silently and watched His friends walk away from Him in silence. Was His prayer of the cup of suffering being taken away from Him granted? It wasn\u2019t. Was His resignation signified by His silence? Perhaps. But in the midst of the emotional turmoil and suffering He was experiencing, He knew one thing: without His suffering, those who have caused Him harm, suffering, pain and betrayal will not have any means of being reconciled to God. If that was the case, then even people in the past and the future will not have any means of reconciling with God, consigning themselves to eternal damnation in hell. It is in these multiple complicated layers of emotions and stakes that we find the human-God Jesus facing the Sanhedrin. On one hand, He can command His angels to slaughter them, asserting His dominance over humanity. On the other hand, He can stay silent and experience the most gruesome torture humanity can ever inflict on a human being. In His hour of extreme need, He chose not to run away or self-medicate, but rather chose to commune with God, letting Him know how He felt despite knowing that God\u2019s plan will not change just because He said a magic prayer. Even though He did not expect God to grant His wish, He still prayed. That is the hardest thing to do as a Christian; when all hope is lost and all you can do is pray. But this is exactly the next step in our relationship with God: when we pray even though we know that God may not grant our prayer, just because we know that we have to bring everything to Him in prayer, warts and all. That kind of faith will help us weather the suffering and storms of lives, even the betrayal of our closest friends and family, as well as the future of pain and suffering."

                            "text": "Something about the background of the poem.. Historically, Europe has been a theater of strife, battles, and wars. Dukes, kings, and emperors fought wars from the safety of their palaces with no great reason, other than expanding their spheres of influence. Through patriotic propaganda, coercion, and brainwashing, ill-trained and ill-equipped young people were sent to the battlefront. What resulted was death, injury, and deprivation of colossal scale. The pain inflicted on the society was immense, but no one had the courage and sense to stand up and ask why the wars were being fought. Every pain was justified on the altar of patriotism. Europe bled, while its rulers boasted.\nIn this poem, the author launches a scathing attack on such senseless resort to violence and bloodshed for no apparent reason. Small causes that could easily be resorted through diplomacy were blown up to project them as affronts to the national honour. No one thought about the young widows, the orphans, the old parents who lost their dearest ones. Battles are savage exercise of strength where morality and rationality are consigned to flames. Brute animal instincts are fanned that unleash the devil in a man. The poet passionately underlines the futility of wars and portrays the urge to kill another human being as something totally abhorrent and vulgar.\nThe poem\u2026 It is set in Blenheim in Germany. A war was fought there in 1704, where British soldiers fought against the French. The British finally prevailed, but the cost to either side was terrible. The scars took long to heal.\nStanza 1 .. Kasper was a German. He had a grandchild named Wilhelmine. It was a summer evening. Kasper had finished his day\u2019s work, and was basking in the soft sunlight. Wilhelmine was playing nearby.\nStanza 2 .. The child\u2019s brother, Peterkin had stumbled upon a large smooth spherical thing while playing near a stream flowing in the vicinity. The boy was curious to know what the object he had brought was.\nStanza 4 .. The grandfather further explained that he regularly finds such skulls in good number when he ploughs his field. The ploughshare digs our the skulls. He says that many soldiers had laid down their lives in the \u2018great\u2019 war, these are the remains of those valiant men.\nStanza 5 .. The two grandchildren, Peterkin and Wilhelmine, the skulls certainly held some dark secrets. They were eager to know from their grandfather, why the people died, and what they fought for. \u2018What was the motivation behind the war, and what purpose it served,\u2019 they begged Kasper to reveal.\nStanza 6 .. Kasper said it was the English who turned their fury on the French and inflicted much death and destruction. However, he could not say what triggered the war, and why mayhem in such gigantic scale happened. He could only say that it was a \u2018famous victory\u2019. He had no other clue.\nStanza 7 .. Kasper recollected the events of the war days at Bleheim. His father\u2019s house beside the stream was reduced to ashes as the enemy rolled in. His parents had to flee with their children to save their lives. They had no place to take shelter in.\nStanza 8 .. The war caused mammoth loss of innocent civilian lives. Men, young and old, women, some of them pregnant, children, all perished. There was death and destruction all around the country. Untold misery and horror ravaged the landscape. But, in the popular perception, it was a \u2018famous victory\u2019.\nStanza 9 .. After the guns of the war fell silent, one saw the scale of loss of human lives in the battle field. Countless dead and decaying bodies lay under the sun. There was no one to give the dead men a decent burial. In the next breath, Kasper says that wars such as this always bring massive loss of life and property. It is inevitable. After all, it was a \u2018famous victory\u2019.\nStanza 10 .. Kasper described hoe the Duke of Marlbro won and brought glory to his people. Prince Eugene endeared himself to his people for bringing such victory and fame. Wilhelmine was not convinced. She felt such sacrifice of life and property was unjust and unwarranted. It was too big a loss to justify the suffering and pain it caused. However, Kasper kept on asserting that it was a \u2018famous victory\u2019.\nStanza 11 .. Kasper narrated how, in the aftermath of the war, everyone praised the Duke for having brought such a great victory. Little Peterkine couldn\u2019t reconcile himself to the stance of his grandpa. He continued to be indignant. He demanded to know what great cause the war was fought for. Kasper ceded some ground to his little Peterkine. He admitted that he didn\u2019t know why the war was fought, but kept repeating that it was a \u2018famous victory\u2019.\nWhat is the underlying theme of the poem?\nDo you feel this poem should be hung in all public place like schools, offices, airports, stations etc. to awaken the citizens about the futility of war?\nIf war is so repugnant to our moral sense, why we have not been able to banish it altogether?\nOh,I am so delighted to see your appreciation. Thank you.\nThis is very helpful. Thanks a lot!\nThe British won the battle inflicting heavy casualties on the French."

In the 18th Projan had an extensive vineyard. It produced wine which was sent to the local market town of Aire sur l\u2019Adour where it was shipped down the Adour river to the port of Bayonne. From there the wine was taken to the Netherlands.\nIn 1986 the Chateau was bought by the famous international architect Bernard Vichet. He fell in love with the Chateau and its location at first sight. He created his unique design for the Chateau combining original 18th century features such as mirrors and armoires with art works drawn from his own art collection of Pre-Raphaelite, cubist and Art Deco sculptures and paintings."

Elizabeth had an elegant, graceful handwriting. Jack mused at how his lover's reflection came through in her penmanship.\nHe closed his eyes. The imagined sound of a gold nib scratching its way across the page filled Jack's ears.\nHe could see it all clearly in his minds eye; the inkwell with its jasmine scented ink resting safely in a crystal and brass holder, the ivory pages once tied with a fine silk ribbon now scattered about, the sticks of burgundy wax and the brass seal, and last but not least, Miss Elizabeth Hastings sitting at her delicate french styled desk writing cherished words of love to him.\nJack easily fell prey to his thoughts.\nWith a sigh of regret, he returned to reality.\nAll contents, including THE LETTER copyright 2000, Josephine Piraneo."

So, with that said, I miss a decent amount of phone calls, e-mails and texts. Which, if you know me, is sort of pathetic because not that many people are calling, e-mailing or texting.\nStill, when the phone is on vibrate, there isn\u2019t much better than getting a text message. You might argue that a call is more significant, but frankly, that\u2019s why it\u2019s worse. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not one of these new-age hipsters that only communicates via textual message. I enjoy a good phone call every so often and even prefer it at times when I know it\u2019ll save me time.\nBut, the text is always a nice feeling. For me, it\u2019s a longer buzz than the e-mail and shorter than the ones in the ringtone. Twitter gives off two shots, voicemails are one longer one. But the text is quick, distinguishable. From the depths of my pocket, I know based on vibration when I\u2019ve received one.\nOf course, my first hope is that it\u2019s a girl. She wants to meet up as soon as I\u2019m free, she found my number and had to reach out to me. Naturally, this is a ridiculous premise\u2014it\u2019s typically a family member or friend\u2014but a boy can dream.\nAnd, you see, that\u2019s what this feeling is about. It\u2019s the excitement of not knowing who it is at first. It\u2019s the fun of knowing that someone actually wanted to reach out to you. Of all the people in their phone book, they chose you.\nPolar Opposite of This Feeling? Getting a phone call from a random number, getting excited it might be someone or something fun and having it be one of those recorded voices telling you that you\u2019ve just won a vacation."

He was the only friend Richard ever had that didn\u2019t have an agenda.\nAfter thirty minutes, the limo rounded the circular driveway of a house that had to be over thirty thousand square feet. Gilbert stopped the limo at the entrance. There were cars parked everywhere.\n\u201cThis is Mr. Daurensbourg\u2019s home in Highland Park. I am one of his assistants. If you follow me, I\u2019ll bring Julio to you.\u201d Gilbert brought Richard to what seemed like a breakfast room and asked him to sit and wait. Richard scanned the room. Strangely, he smelled peaches. There must be a bowl of the ripe fruit on the kitchen counter.\nGilbert signaled Etienne. What are those two up to? Julio wondered.\nEtienne nodded and turned to Julio. \u201cI have another wedding present for you.\u201d He wore a secretive, pleased smile.\nJulio scolded, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have bought me anything else. I have everything I need, right here.\u201d He hugged his husband. Etienne motioned Gilbert forward.\nEtienne laughed and put his arm around Julio\u2019s shoulders, and they made their way to the breakfast room.\nJulio gasped. Richard\u2019s head was visible from the entrance to the room. His red hair had turned to a darker auburn. It called him like a beacon. Julio stopped and frowned. He knew that posture from when they were kids. Something was very wrong in Richard\u2019s world. He sent a message to his Mate: Richard is in some kind of trouble. I recognize those lines on his forehead.\nMaybe we can help, Etienne offered.\nJulio flashed his Mate a brilliant smile. Maybe we can. He held out his hand.\n\u201cRichard, by the gods, I thought I\u2019d never see you again,\u201d Julio greeted his old friend.\nRichard stood, ran to Julio and gave him a hug. Etienne emitted a low growl, and Julio sent him a terse message over the Mate link. Don\u2019t be stupid. I told you we were childhood friends. It would be like screwing my brother.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Richard. Would you like a beer instead?\u201d Julio asked.\n\u201cI wanted to see you. Social Services wouldn\u2019t let me contact anyone since I was a minor and a ward of the state. They put me in a group home because I was gay and then promptly forgot about me.\u201d Julio sniffed.\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have abandoned you. We couldn\u2019t find you.\u201d Richard\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that the company that was in the news for defective power supplies for the Cougar II?\u201d One of Etienne\u2019s eyebrows arched.\n\u201cWere you able to get a job somewhere else?\u201d Etienne asked.\n\u201cYou have proof of this?\u201d Etienne asked, jaw clenched.\n\u201cNo, they\u2019re not, but there was nothing I could do to stop them.\n\u201cI can guarantee it.\u201d Julio peered over Richard\u2019s head at Etienne and let go of his friend\u2019s hand.\n\u201cOf course, we\u2019ll read your resume, if only because you\u2019re a friend of Julio\u2019s and our family loves him.\u201d Etienne kissed the top of Julio\u2019s head.\nRichard\u2019s hands were shaking. \u201cI have them here in my satchel.\u201d After he sat down, he opened his bag, carefully removed his computer and pulled out the folders that contained his resumes. He handed one to Etienne, along with copies of personal letters of recommendation from his professors. He also retrieved both the reports he\u2019d sent to management and the sheets containing the test results with the Minster and Charter components.\nJulio grinned at the flabbergasted expression on Richard\u2019s face.\nArmand came down the stairs, followed by Henri and then Julien.\nRichard stood to meet Julio\u2019s friends.\nArmand walked over to shake his hand, followed by Henri and then Julien. When Julien\u2019s hand touched Richard\u2019s, a spark flickered between them. Julien\u2019s jaw dropped. Richard jumped back. Julio broke out in a huge grin.\nHenri excused himself. \u201cI\u2019ll bring the others down,\u201d he said sadly and went back up the stairs to get the other members of the board."

The doctors aren\u2019t sure what the problem is and tell him to make a note of what happened just before each attack\u2014what he ate, what he was doing.\nSometimes he feels ashamed of his \u201cevil thoughts\u201d that maybe Louise wants him dead. Perhaps it isn\u2019t really true. After 15 years of marriage, he still loves her and wants to continue their relationship. But is she having an affair?\nThey live above a stationery shop. It is his wife\u2019s business, having inherited it from her father. Everything belongs to her. Lomel owns nothing of his own and must ask her for money. He is totally dependent on her. She\u2019s the boss. The iron staircase of the title leads from the first floor up directly to their bedroom and the other rooms where they live.\nLomel often stands at the top of the staircase listening to what is said downstairs at the shop. He wonders about the men Louise meets there every day\u2014perhaps she is serious about one of them? He spends his days fretting and speculating about his wife while trying to recover from his illness.\nWe learn how Etienne and Louise first met 15 years ago. She was married to her first husband at the time. Etienne came to her shop on business and they soon began an affair. Louise\u2019s callousness is seen when her sister-in-law died: all it meant to her was the chance for a long rendezvous with her lover, Etienne, since her husband had to go away for the funeral.\nEtienne and Louise agree to marry, but what about her husband? During one of his visits, she tells Etienne that her husband has become seriously ill. After a few weeks, the husband dies. Etienne doesn\u2019t question her about it.\nHe believes she poisoned her husband, as she might be poisoning him now, to get him out of the way and marry a younger man. Etienne has the same symptoms that her previous husband had immediately before he died: weight loss, tiredness, and heart trouble. For the 15 years of their marriage, he had never asked his wife how her former husband had died.\nPart II opens with Etienne seeing a doctor and asking if it\u2019s possible to determine if he is the victim of arsenic poisoning. At first, the doctor isn\u2019t sure. Etienne resolves to stay with Louise in spite of her and not to die. He takes the blame for his poor attitude. He tells her and their friends that he is a new person.\nLater he goes to the doctor again for more arsenic testing and the doctor finds positive results. Etienne finally has proof that Louise is trying to murder him. He tries to figure out what he will do. The doctor suggests he is obligated to go to the police but Etienne refuses to give him any information and leaves.\nEtienne goes back home and acts naturally. Whenever he eats or drinks something he believes is spiked with poison, he leaves the house and throws it up. He decides to spy on his wife by following her and find out where she goes. Etienne sees her at the post office where she reads a letter that makes her very happy. He sees her receive additional letters in the following days, probably from the same person, her new lover.\nEtienne follows his wife as she leaves the shop one day and sees her go to a restaurant. He waits and after an hour, he sees her leave arm-in-arm with a man. He sees them kiss as they part. He recognizes the man as Roger Cornu, son of a printer in their stationery shop.\nEven now, knowing everything, Etienne still wants to keep Louise, and to keep living. He realizes he is as much to blame as his wife for the death of her former husband, since he agreed to marry her while she was still with him. Feelings of guilt over the death of the ex-husband often possess him. He wants their relationship to remain as it is, keeping to themselves with their silent secrets.\nEtienne follows Cornu to his workplace and home, not finding him. But he is told the name of the restaurant where he usually hangs out. He then goes to a gun shop and buys a revolver. Afterward, Louise will understand, he believes, because he did the same thing she did before. He can\u2019t afford to lose her because he is completely dependent on her.\nHe goes to Cornu\u2019s favorite restaurant and sees him there, writing a letter, probably to Louise. Etienne then goes to Cornu\u2019s home and lies in wait for him during the night. When Cornu arrives, he notices Etienne standing outside, and calls to him. Etienne is surprised Cornu recognizes him so easily, but shouldn\u2019t have, since they are so similar, two steps on a staircase.\nSimenon masterfully sets up the reader throughout the narrative for the strange, brutal resolution. Etienne hesitates to pull out his gun. He is unable to kill Cornu, as he is the same as himself and Louise\u2019s ex-husband. Unable to change from the kind of person he is to someone like his wife, he can\u2019t traverse the \u201ciron staircase\u201d that separates them. Cornu, knowing his own guilt, is stunned that Etienne doesn\u2019t pull out a gun and shoot him. He bids him goodnight and goes inside. Half an hour later, sitting outside, Etienne shoots himself.\nLong out-of-print in English, The Iron Staircase, with its psychological drama and pervading existentialist atmosphere, echoes Simenon\u2019s French peers, such as Sartre and Camus. It is one of his finest efforts."

I don\u2019t know if I have ever mentioned my love of St. Clair or of Anna or of every single thing about Anna and the French Kiss. Yeah, I\u2019m certain I have never mentioned my love of it or the fact that I have read it four times. \ud83d\ude00 In all seriousness I know I have told every single one of you that you need to read this book whether you have read it or not and I\u2019m here again to tell you all to read even if you already have. Love, just love!\nI have read this book three times now, yes 3*, and it has somehow gotten better each time I pick it up. There is something about this story that just makes me feel good and. Find myself going back to it again and again. It gives me this feeling of peace that is hard to describe. Between the friendships, the relationships and the back drop of Paris it transports me to a very happy place that I don\u2019t seem to want to leave or forget.\nThe book is about Anna, a girl from Atlanta, that is forced to go to Paris for her last year of high school. Not knowing the language or anyone at her new school Anna is left alone and missing her best friend Bridgette and her crush that was possibly turning into something more, Toph. She is surrounded by unfamiliar everything and all she wants to do is go back to the safety of Atlanta. And then her next door neighbor Meredith takes her in and introduces her to her friends and the one boy that changes everything, St. Clair. Etienne St. Clair, the boy dreams are made of. All of a sudden France isn\u2019t so bad. Pretty soon Anna has a life in France and friends, Meredith, Josh, Rashmi and St. Clair. They break Anna out of her shell and comfort zone and show her Paris isn\u2019t so bad. And when things start to get complicated at home Anna wants nothing more then to retreat back to the place she had been desperate to escape, back to St. Clair. Too bad there are two problems with this. She is not only head over heels in love with him but he has a girlfriend.\nI honestly don\u2019t know how to even begin to describe Anna and Etienne\u2019s relationship. It is so perfectly crush worthy, adorable that I\u2019m not sure I can give it justice. I mean reading about these two made me crave that feeling you get when you have an honest to God crush. The anticipation you feel when you see that crush was the feeling I got with every page I turned and Anna and St. Clair went from buddies to Anna and Etienne, maybe more then buddies, to Anna and St. Clair that won\u2019t cross any lines to Anna and Etienne the couple crazy about each other. Every emotion they felt, every conflict of uncertainty that was there I felt too and that made the characters and this couple in particular a work of greatness. And the way that Perkins showed cased Anna\u2019s feelings, towards this boy that had her all over the place, by having Anna call him St. Clair and Etienne was just masterful and the perfect way to describe their ever changing relationship.\nStephanie Perkins wrote an amazingly superb book about figuring out what you want out of life, dealing with crushes and relationships and knowing what is worth it. Truthfully I will never accurately describe the amazingness of this book and the feelings it gives me. It is pretty impossible to put into words. Maybe the fact that I have read it 3 times in less then 2 years will help. Haha. A definite must read\u2026at least once.\nAs an added bonus, here is what I dressed Anna in for a challenge that was requested of me. Basically sums up the character in my opinion.\nHave you read Anna yet? What do you think of my version of what she would wear? Did I do good?"

                            "text": "A lot of us start healthy lifestyle changes with friends and family. A support system is a must! But what happens when the motivation everyone started with starts to wain for a some?\nI am fortunate to have a fairly healthy eating and living family who generally support what I do. My husband is health conscious but left to his own devices won't always choose the healthiest meals and I've found the best defense for both of us is for me to prepared with healthy dinner ideas. As far as working out, he's just as likely (or more!) to motivate me to workout as I am to motivate him. I'm lucky that way.\nThat being said, I've had a lot of friends jump on the healthy living train after seeing my successes. It's great to inspire people but if I'm totally honest, I find myself wondering how much I can or should push these friends to stick with their new goals and how much I should just leave it be.\nI use My Fitness Pal which allows you to see when your friends log in, when they work out and when they lose weight. When someone hasn't logged in for awhile, it prompts you to encourage them. I always wonder if I should or do changes truly have to come only from the person making those changes? I worry that reminding someone to stick to their goals and plans will just come off as condescending. When we fall off the wagon, aren't we really the first to know anyway? Hearing a reminder from a friend can seem like just another guilt inducer. It's a fine line between support and pushing your own beliefs on others. I often wonder what my role as a friend is and if I invest too heavily in another's success, will I end pushing them away or being negatively effected by them? Can my motivation motivate more than just me?\nWould you want to hear from a friend? What do you think your place is in the healthy journey of loved ones? Do you want others to encourage you or does that just leave you feeling pressured or guilty?\nI think accountability is important!! WW is an effective diet plan, but I believe the biggest contribution they provide is accountability through weight ins & what not. Sometimes we all need a \"body check' to remind us of our goals. :-/ #guilty conscious.\nHaha I love you! It's such a fine line because some people respond well to tough love and others just feel defeated by it. I'm learning this more and more with my personal training stuff. Each person needs their own style of motivation.\nI totally agree with you on programs like WW. I first lost weight with them and knowing you had to WI provided accountability and knowing the people weighing you had stood in your shoes too helps when the scaled isn't friendly!\nNow go log into MFP!!"

                            "text": "GFX9.COM share Mastering calligraphy: how to write in cursive script, you can download now.\nTags: drawing, tutorials, typography, vector.\nIn this lesson of \"Mastering Calligraphy\" we're going to learn how to write like the great Jane Austen. Flowing, cursive lettering is still seen today on wedding invitations and menus at fancy restaurants. While it looks extremely difficult to ink, it's actually made of two basic strokes. Better yet, with the Cursive Script, you hardly ever have to lift your pen off the paper! So let's dive in to the Cursive Script.\nBefore we dive into Cursive Script, let's warm up our hands.\nPrint out four or five of the practice sheets on a nice cardstock or Bristol paper.\nPractice the basic upward stroke for one or two lines to warm up. This stroke is a bit new but very easy. You start just above the bottom line. Then you curve down and to the right to touch the bottom line. Next, you shoot up to the top line.\nPractice the basic curve stroke for one or two lines to warm up. This one hasn't changed but you may curl up a bit more than before.\nOkay! Now we're ready to start. In this lesson on mastering calligraphy, we're going to learn a very familiar alphabet called Cursive Script.\nLet's take a look at the Cursive Script alphabet. As you can see, it looks almost identical to the cursive you learned in elementary school. The blue arrows above show the directions of the pen strokes and the numbers below tell you how many strokes make up each letter. Most letters will be made with just one stroke as cursive is all about efficiency. We're going to start with the lowercase alphabet and break it up into two sections: upward stroke letters and curve stroke letters. So let's start with the downward stroke letters!\nThe letters b, f, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, and z all begin with the downward stroke. Some have strokes that fill up the entire height of the line and others only reach to the dashed line. Some, like the 'f' even reach below the bottom line. To start, I'm going to show you the direction of each stroke plus how many stokes make up each letter. When you're writing out the letters yourself, you can sketch them out using your pencil first. Then you can simply follow the pencil lines with your pen.\nLet's start with the 'u' since it's easiest. Place your pen tip on the bottom line. Make an upward stroke to the dashed line. Then make a downward stroke that dips to the bottom line and then swings back up again. Next, make another downward stroke and end with a little curl. Voila! You have a Cursive Script 'u'. It kind of felt like drawing waves on the sea, right?\nRepeat making the letter 'u' three times so that you get the feel of it. Many letters, such as the i, j, m, n, r, v, w, and y are very similar to the 'u'. Once you have the 'h' down, it's easy to see how other letters are made.\nLet's try a harder letter: h. The 'h' starts the same as the 'h' but its stroke reaches all the way up to the top line. You then arc to the left and make a downward stroke to the bottom line. You'll cross over your previous line right near the bottom. Now arc up to the dash line and make a downward stroke back down to the bottom line, curling up at the end.\nRepeat making the letter 'h' three times so that you get the feel of it. Many letters, such as the b, f, k, and l are very similar to the 'h'.\nThe letters a, c, d, e, g, o, and q all begin with the curved stroke. To start, I'm going to show you the direction of each stroke plus how many stokes make up each letter. You can always sketch out the letters using your pencil first to feel more comfortable. Then you can simply follow the pencil lines with your pen.\nLet's start with the 'o' since it's easiest. Place your pen tip just below the dashed line. Arc down and around to the right, returning to the starting point. Then make a little curl to the right. Voila! You have a Cursive Script 'o'. Not too hard, was it?\nRepeat making the letter 'o' three times so that you get the feel of it. Once you have the 'o' down, it's easy to see how the other downward curve letters are made.\nLet's try a harder letter: g. Make the same start to the 'g' as you did the 'o' but go up past the starting point. Then make a downward stroke and go past the bottom line. Curl to the left and make an upward, diagonal stroke that goes a bit above the bottom line. It should intersect the downward stroke of your 'g' right at the bottom line.\nRepeat making the letter 'g' three times so that you get the feel of it.\nNow that you've written each letter multiple times, it's time to put it all together and write out the lowercase alphabet.\nThe uppercase alphabet always plays by different rules and is generally much more elaborate. The curved strokes are much bigger and the upward strokes have more curls and slant to them. Besides that, the uppercase letters are just as simple to write as the lowercase. You can always sketch out the letters using your pencil first to feel more comfortable. Then you can simply follow the pencil lines with your pen. When it comes to uppercase letters, I prefer to pencil mine out beforehand.\nSince most of the letters begin with a curved stroke, I didn't divide the alphabet into groups. Instead, we'll simply work our way through it, using the guide above to see how many strokes each letter is made of and what direction the strokes go.\nSo let's start with an easy letter. We'll start with the letter 'l'. Place your pen tip on the top line. Arc down and around to the right, coming up to the top line and making something like a bad 'o' shape. Then make a downward stroke to the bottom line. Your line will be slanting to the right. When you reach the bottom line, curl up and around. Finally, sweep your line out to the right, making a nice gentle curve. Voila! You have a Cursive Script uppercase 'l'. Remember, it's all about curls and slants. The bigger, the better.\nRepeat making the letter 'l' three times so that you get the feel of it. Like I said before, when it comes to uppercase letters, the more flourish, the better so don't be scared to make some big curls and sweeping lines. Once you have the 'l' down, it's easy to see how other uppercase letters like the c, e, g, o, and q are made.\nLet's try a harder letter: r. Start with your pen tip on the top line. Make a downward stroke to the bottom line, arcing slightly to the left and ending in a fancy curl. Then lift up your place and place it on the dashed line. Make a curved stroke up and around to the left toward the top line. Then curve down to the dashed line again. You make a lopsided 'o' in the top half of the writing space. Now make another curved stroke out to the right and down to the bottom line, again ending in a fancy curl. A bit superfluous but not too hard, right?\nRepeat making the letter 'r' three times so that you get the feel of it. The letter 'r' is very similar to the letters b, d, f, i, j, p, and t. So once you have this one down, you can do the rest!\nLet's write something a bit more exciting! Most people use Cursive Script for invitations so let's write out some celebratory phrases.\nYou've Mastered the Cursive Script!\nThis style of calligraphy is the one most often used for wedding invitations and party announcements. You might also think of Jane Austen when you see it. I hope that you've discovered it's actually quite a simple font to write, despite looking very fancy. The more you practice, the easier it will be to ink the letters and the faster you'll be at writing. In future tutorials, we'll learn a slightly more complicated script that looks even fancier."

                            "text": "\u2190 So what was on trend at \u201cBloom\u201d?\nWhilst all the senses are connected to memory, it is scent which can be the most powerful in recalling the past \u2026 an old rose reminiscent of granny\u2019s garden, the faint scent of a familiar perfume, cloves baking in an apple pie.\nFor me, certain flowers recall the ten years I spent in South Africa. A stroll in the glasshouses of Dublin\u2019s Botanic gardens when the Brunfelsia pauciflora is in flower is certain to draw me back to that time. Although not native to South Africa, it was widely grown there for its strong sweet smell; it was known as yesterday-today-and-tomorrow as its petals began as purple, then lilac and finally faded to white.\nMimosa, Acacia dealbata, an Australian native, is widely grown in Mediterranean climates and its delicious scent will always remind me of Spring holidays in southern France or Italy. Its flowers are frequently given to women in Italy, Russia and Georgia on International Women\u2019s Day (March 8th). Here, it can often be found in florist shops in early Spring and fills the house with its sweet scent and cheerful Spring yellow. I can\u2019t resist it.\nLavender is also an evocative plant which invariably delights \u2013 the scent of summer, bees humming along lavender hedges, holidays, sunshine on Proven\u00e7al fields. I never fail to plant it in my gardens, always near a bench or by the house, its scent reminds me of happy times, holidays spent long ago with good friends near Aix-en-Provence.\nIt isn\u2019t just places but people which are brought to mind when we catch the scent of something which stops us in our tracks. My late father bought me a flowering shrub for my first garden, a Philadelphus, or mock-orange, with its creamy white very fragrant flowers; its scent will forever be associated with him.\nBut why does scent create nostalgia? It seems that smells enter through the nose to the olfactory bulb, part of the limbic system, the emotional part of our brain; whereas words go into the thinking part of our brains. This explains why smells evoke emotional, nostalgic feelings rather than anything concrete.\nThe scent of boxwood always carries me back to Virginia where I grew up, and the smell of dry earth when rain begins to fall takes me to its hot summer days. Lilac transports me to my first garden, near Toronto, Ontario. Sweetly scented narcissus tell me it is spring, and that I am at my present garden, Glen Villa, in the Eastern Townships of Quebec. Scent equals nostalgia. So don\u2019t get me started on madeleines!\nYes, boxwood, or box as we call it, has a very distinctive scent. I always recall the Victorian garden at Hunter\u2019s Hotel here in Ireland, with its garden of box hedging. Lilac and narcissi too are very nostalgic too. Thank you, more memories!\nYes, you\u2019re right, lilies such a lovely scent. Love the idea of Easter corsages of lilies. You\u2019ve reminded me of my mother wearing a corsage of orchids when she went out to a special danse. Thank you, hadn\u2019t thought about that in years.\nSeeing the \u2018yesterday today and tomorrow\u2019 really takes me back to our last house in Johannesburg. The scent of gardenias reminds me of a bottle of perfume I got as a Christmas present from my aunt when I was fourteen. It was such a surprise, because every year without fail, she would send me a manicure set for my birthday and again at Christmas. \ud83d\ude42 The scent of red roses reminds me of me in my early 20\u2019s when I had a small black and red bottle of \u2018Joy\u2019 perfume, which I eked out for as long as I could, because it was so expensive. Thanks for the memories, Lorna. Your photos are beautiful.\nThanks so much Sylvia! Yes, good old yesterday today and tomorrow, Jo\u2019burg memories. Lovely to hear about your other memories, you were certainly lucky to have Jean Patou\u2019s \u2018Joy\u2019 \u2013 is it still in the red and black bottle I wonder?\nOh how I enjoyed this post, Jardin\u2013the fragrances that remind one of sweet times and loved ones. A lovely reminder of the beauties of life on earth.\nThe scent of home. When I travel back home, the smell of the grass and trees bring back the childhood memories of hours playing outside until dark.\nI had just posted how the fragrance of mock orange blossoms brought the memory of my mother so powerfully to me so it got me thinking. I searched online for \u201cNostalgia through fragrance of a mock orange\u201d and it brought me right to your blog.\nIt must be an incredible bit of Love magic to be so powerful as to put a person in a trance and bring her back to childhood\u2026wouldn\u2019t you say?"

This one end up as a very clean blend on me (thanks white musk), and it smells almost austere. Medium throw and wear length.\nA lavender scent, rounded out by white musk. While not sweet, the lavender in this scent is not a sharp, medicinal lavender. I couldn't pick the teakwood out my itself at first, but as the scent wears, the teakwood comes out more and more until it rivals the strength of lavender in this scent. I never got the cacao note though. Overall, a relatively simple lavender scent and unfortunately, pretty forgettable in my opinion.\nIn the bottle, it's a strange cacophony of cacao, lavender and white musk.\nOnce it's warmed on my skin the cacao disappears and the lavender and musk seem to be a little more in alignment.\nAt dry down, this becomes a predominantly white musk scent with the lavender bringing up the rear. It's clean and light as white musks tend to be. I can see choosing this on very warm spring and summer days and evenings.\nChocolate dominates here on my skin. Alongside it, I get teak, blackcurrant, and lavender.\nI don't pick up white musk, which is cool because it goes so powdery on me.\nThis is an appealing blend. I love the teak with this cacao. I'm not seeking more chocolate, but I'm glad I tried this.\nA shimmering white musk lavender with very faint traces of cacao.\nReminds me a bit of the 2016 Lilith waiting, except that one was smelling a bit cleaner."

                            "text": "When a little bird at Chanel (actually, they\u2019re all little birds at Chanel) told The Scent Critic that their next fragrance launch was based around lavender and vanilla, I said a silent \u2018hmmmm\u2019. Because lavender and vanilla aren\u2019t natural bedfellows, in fragrance. They don\u2019t go together like a horse and carriage; they go together like a horse and \u2013 well, a tricycle. Or a pair of rollerskates.\nBut this is a Labradoodle of a fragrance, as it turns out. Or a Cockapoo. You know: those dogs which are created by taking two fairly attractive breeds (for instance, labrador and poodle), and creating something altogether more cute and appealing. (Though not a \u2018dog person\u2019 \u2013 The Scent Critic has plastic bag issues \u2013 I have been known to melt when encountering a Cockapoo on the end of a lead.) Lavender on its own: aromatic, but a touch antiseptic. Vanilla? Great in an ice cream, or a sponge cake, but over-eager use in a fragrance sends it speeding in the direction of ickiness. Together? In \u00fcber-nose Jacques Polge\u2019s hands, at least, somewhat delicious.\nIt took me a few wears to really get my head round Jersey, nevertheless. (And a few \u2018Wow, you smell nice\u2019-es, from friends and colleagues, which always helps.) It\u2019s crisp and clean at the start: I really am trailing my fingers through a lavender bush, which obviously is the effect Polge was going for. Now, classically, lavender is a masculine ingredient. Or a Little Old Lady ingredient (familiar from brushing your lips against a favourite great-aunt\u2019s slightly hirsute cheek, and getting a whiff of her Yardley). But here, the herbal cleanliness mellows in just a few minutes, and Jersey becomes cloud-soft and cashmere-snuggly.\nIn reality it\u2019s intended, I\u2019m sure, to be soft as jersey itself: the fabric which Coco Chanel embraced in the early 1920s, taking it out of the underwear drawer \u2013 it was worn, by chaps, in vest form \u2013 and using it instead to create drape-y clothes which liberated women from whalebone corsetry in one French-seamed bound. Why, the bottle I was sent \u2013 not sure if this is standard issue or Scent Critic privilege \u2013 actually came with its own drawstring jersey pouch.\nAs I fossick around in my scent memories, the fragrance it most reminds me of is the original Tartine et Chocolate (from Givenchy): originally marketed as a children\u2019s scent, because of its subtle delicacy, but loved by grown-ups, and \u2013 just like Jersey \u2013 unfolding to a vanilla warmth, on the skin. Were you so inclined, and despite the white musk whispers in the base, you could also safely spray Jersey on a 4-year-old. (Not that you probably would, at this price, unless you happened to be wedded to a Russian oligarch).\nEqually, it could be worn by a man, I\u2019d say (though probably not the stevedore type), and would smell tr\u00e8s elegant as he wafted around. It doesn\u2019t hang around for that long, to be totally honest, but I think it\u2019s nice while it does. That might sound like damning with faint praise, but I like both the bold Proven\u00e7ale lavender overture, and the pretty, powdery dry-down. And I\u2019ve found myself fairly compulsively re-spritzing, since Jersey landed on my desk, which probably speaks volumes.\nPlus: I really love it when perfumers, like dog breeders, break the rules. Rule-breaking is a great Chanel tradition \u2013 why not make frocks out of vest fabric, or be first to try to balance lavender with vanilla? \u2013 and while this may not be the greatest scent creation of the 21st century, and not quite up there alongside Sycomore or 28 La Pausa in the roll-call of Chanel Les Exclusifs triumphs, Jersey deserves a rosette, for trying.\nA black and white rosette, please.\nThis one was not well received elsewhere in perfume blog world but I like it too. Not love, but like, and will probably break out my decant in the spring along with Hermes Brin de Reglisse.However, as much as I enjoyed your review, how about Caron\u2019s Pour un Homme for pairing vanilla and lavender? That is one of my favourite men\u2019s fragrances ever and there is something of it in by Kilian\u2019s Taste of Heaven, also yummy.\nWhen I sidled up to the Chanel counter I only gave this latest addition to their line a cursory sniff just from holding the bottle and smelling the atomizer as it was recently spritzed by someone other than myself\u2026 I was mildly bemused it smelled like the laundry Boost powders I regularly use: borax and washing soda. Only less harsh with flowers and slight a slightly sweet scent floating above it.\nI honestly think I can get the same effect if I put essential oils and artificial vanilla into my rinse water of my laundry cycle I could get the same effect! That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t bother to investigate any further by sprinting it on a card. Loathe the thought of perfume smelling like laundry. Granted, I like it better than the nauseating air freshener CHANCE, the worst offender is the eau version. Those are awful!\nI actually like this one from Chanel. Its unlike their usual strong scent. I love how this is soft and feminine. I didn\u2019t like it at all in the beginning when I smelled it the first time but this fragrance grows on you after a while."

And what a spectacular debut the former Bieber lover has made. Stepping out in New York for the first time since the shock engagement, Gomez\u2019s first public appearance was spectacular for the very reason it was everything but; it was simple, understated and wholly irreverent. Wearing grey sweats, a black tee (which read \u201conly the strong survive\u201d) and oversized sunnies, the ultra casual look was paired with something money can\u2019t buy \u2013 a big grin \u2013 the biggest I-don\u2019t-care of them all.\nBut there was one remarkable difference about Gomez\u2019s look \u2013 a new \u2018do.\nFor the past year or so, Gomez\u2019s blunt chop has made even those with the most Rapunzel-like inclinations toy over the idea of cutting their hair. \u2018To Selena or To not Selena\u2019 has been the question plaguing all probable choppers, with her bob proving the ultimate hair inspo for many. But we all know the best revenge on an ex-lover is a new look, and Gomez has proved this spectacularly \u2013 by way of her hair.\nTaking her hair to new lengths, Gomez stepped out with long, lush, raven-like locks. With thanks to some masterful hair extensions, the new elongated length not only proves remarkably different to her blunt bob \u2013 which had become somewhat of a signature beauty note lately \u2013 but makes for the perfect insouciant hair flicking (Bieber, who?). Accompanied by that self-assured smile and glowing skin (plus subtle self-affirmation on said black tee) \u2013 what better way to handle a case of the ex. Poise, confidence and a new \u2018do: textbook vengeance 101."

                            "text": "Queen Elizabeth sacrificed many elements of her life for her country. She sacrificed her love, her dreams, and her most prized possession. She sacrificed her hair, which, during the Elizabethan Age was a woman\u2019s most prized possession. Queen Elizabeth made the decision to forgo her beauty and all else in order to display her love for England. Perhaps the only man she ever loved, Sir Robert, was a married man whom the Queen was \u201cforced\u201d to distance herself from. Her life was in danger by many powerful individuals including the Pope. The Pope felt that Queen Elizabeth was a threat to his supremacy and for that he could not allow her to be powerful.\nWhen Queen Elizabeth came to the throne her country was an impoverished and indebted one. During her long rule she turned her country into the most powerful nation on Earth. She made the choice to marry no one other than England. She therefore produced no heirs and her greatness lived on through the actions of others. Her rule was so amazing that it became known as the Golden Age (in England). Queen Elizabeth was an ordinary woman who wanted nothing more than to be happy. She never abused her power and when problems occurred they were handled not in a chaotic manner, but in quite a civilized one. In the movie Elizabeth there is a point in time when many people are murdered. At this time multiple people are trying to kill Elizabeth because of the death warrant the Pope had issued and therefore, the manner in which the situation was handled was nothing more than self-defense.\nBy cutting off her hair and wearing white makeup Elizabeth was purifying herself. She was \u201cre-virginizing\u201d herself which is a process entirely spiritual and not physical. Removing her hair was the most symbolic thing a queen could do. The cutting of her hair symbolized a new start for her. Her hair had been there to witness all of her sins and all of her life and certain things needed to be forgotten or not thought about. The white paste makeup symbolized both purity and the statue. The statue of the Virgin Mary was how Elizabeth desired to be; she desired to be looked upon as the statue was."

                            "text": "Justina: Zivile Zablackaite (Appeared in TAYO ISSUE 3).\nThe afternoon before the first day of school, ten-year-old Magdalena Johnson\u2019s mother told her that eating carrots gave children pretty eyes, so Magda ate three, even though she hated how they snapped between her teeth, how their skin was bumpy and gristly, and how they didn\u2019t taste like anything.\nAfterward she rushed to her bedroom mirror to watch her eyes turn blue. By bedtime, her eyes were still slanted and dark, her eyelashes were still short and stubby, and she vowed to never eat carrots again.\n\u201cYour grandfather is Chinese,\u201d her mother said, when she asked why her eyes were slanted. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky. Very smart.\u201d She tapped her forehead.\n\u201cNo one else at school has slanted eyes,\u201d Magda said.\n\u201cAll the Filipino live in New Jersey and California,\u201d her mother replied.\nBut Jenny was better than no one, and now that she was gone, Magda had no one, which meant it was time to become best friends with Danielle Tiptree.\nDanielle Tiptree reminded Magda of those fancy porcelain dolls she would see at the hobby shops. Her skin was creamy like milk, and she had long blond hair that she tied in silky ribbons. Her eyes were big, blue, and round. Very American.\nAt lunch the next day, Magda went straight from the lunch line to Danielle\u2019s table, where three other milky-white girls sat. All of them pulled neatly packed peanut butter sandwiches from shiny Coca-Cola lunchboxes. They barely looked at Magda when she sat down and opened her own lunchbox, which she did very quickly so they wouldn\u2019t notice that it was the same one that she\u2019d had since the end of second grade.\nThe white girls didn\u2019t say a word to her until she opened her Tupperware full of boiled chicken and cabbage, which her mother had cooked the night before.\n\u201cI\u2019m not Chinese,\u201d Magdalena said.\nMagda slipped the Tupperware back in her lunchbox. Once the chicken and cabbage disappeared, so did she. Danielle and her friends kept talking like she wasn\u2019t there.\nThere were other things to eat besides the chicken and cabbage. Her mother had also packed an apple and some orange slices, but Magda was afraid to take anything else out. She didn\u2019t like being invisible, but hated being singled out even more. What if she took out an apple slice and the edges were slightly browned? What if she bit into the orange wedge and some juice squirted out? Best to sit silently.\nShe put her arms on the table and leaned forward just a little, then looked around the lunchroom. That\u2019s what she usually did when she sat with Jenny, because it made her look like she was part of the conversation.\nAt a nearby table, a third grader flung a spaghetti noodle at one of his friends and the teacher scolded him. At another, two girls looked at something on a loose-leaf paper and giggled. And in the corner of the lunchroom was Raven Baker, the darkest and heaviest girl in the class. The other children called her \u201cButterball.\u201d Raven had a lunchbox in front of her, but she wasn\u2019t eating anything. Raven never ate anything at lunch, even though she was twice the size of everyone else. Instead, she read books. And she always sat alone.\nBy the time the bell rang, it felt like there were knives in the pit of Magda\u2019s belly. The other girls picked up their leftover trash and left the cafeteria in a group; she followed slowly behind, carrying a lunchbox heavy with food.\nThat night, when she saw her mama shoveling more chicken and cabbage into a Tupperware container, she asked if she could bring a peanut butter sandwich instead.\n\u201cIn the Philippines, children don\u2019t tell parents what they want to eat. Parents tell the children. That\u2019s the difference between Filipino children and American children.\u201d Once the Tupperware was full of food, she snapped it shut all the way around and put it in Magda\u2019s lunchbox.\n\u201cCan I at least have a new lunchbox?\u201d Magda asked.\nThe next day, Magda debated whether to sit with Danielle again and starve, or sit somewhere else and eat.\nShe decided to sit somewhere else and eat, but the only available chair was next to Raven Baker. Before she sat with Raven, she glanced back to see if Danielle and her friends were watching. They weren\u2019t paying any attention to her, so she sat down.\nRaven looked surprised, but didn\u2019t say anything.\n\u201cI brought an apple and a juice box. And this is chicken and cabbage. It doesn\u2019t smell good.\u201d Magdalena debated whether she should open it. Her tummy grumbled.\n\u201cI bet it smells better than chitlins,\u201d Raven said.\nThat sounded like a dish her mom liked to cook, but she didn\u2019t call it chitlins.\n\u201cWhat do you have for lunch?\u201d Magda asked.\nRaven\u2019s lunchbox hadn\u2019t been opened.\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m not hungry,\u201d Raven said.\nMagda ate her apple, then sat back and looked around.\n\u201cAren\u2019t you gonna eat your chicken?\u201d Raven asked.\nLater that afternoon, while Danielle and her friends took turns on the monkey bars, Magda found Raven and asked if she wanted to play hopscotch. After school, they sat together at the pickup line. They faced each other, cross-legged, book bags in their laps, occasionally glancing down the line of cars to see if they saw their mothers. Every time Magda glanced back, she also looked to see if Danielle or any of her friends were there, even though she knew they usually took the bus.\n\u201cAre you Chinese?\u201d Raven asked.\nRaven touched her stubby ponytail. Her hair was coarse and dry and pieces on the side had fallen out of the ponytail and stuck out in all directions. \u201cI like your hair,\u201d Raven said.\nMagda\u2019s mother appeared behind her in the family sedan.\nWhen Magdalena got in her mother\u2019s car and shut the door, she waved at Raven, who was still sitting there with her bag.\n\u201cWho is that?\u201d her mother asked. They made their way out of the school\u2019s driveway and onto the road. Magdalena turned around to see if she could still see Raven. She couldn\u2019t.\nHer mother pointed at a group of white girls walking along the sidewalk.\nAt morning recess the next day, Raven asked Magdalena if she could braid her hair. Raven sat behind her under the shade of one of the enormous magnolia trees, then separated Magda\u2019s long black hair into three groups of locks.\nNot really, Magda thought. White girls don\u2019t have slanty eyes and stubby eyelashes.\n\u201cDo you wash your hair every day?\u201d Raven asked.\nMagda had no idea what she was talking about, but she didn\u2019t ask.\n\u201cWhat do you want to be when you grow up?\u201d Raven asked.\nDanielle and her friends had been out of sight when Raven and Magda sat down, but a game of chase now brought them near the magnolia tree. When Danielle saw them, she whispered to her friends, walked over, and put her hands on her hips. Her legs stuck out of her denim skirt like two twigs.\nMagdalena didn\u2019t know what to say, so she said nothing.\n\u201cShe\u2019s not Chinese,\u201d Raven said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have lice,\u201d Raven said.\nDanielle looked at Magda, told her that she better wash her hair the minute she got home then disappeared down the playground with her friends.\nThat afternoon, when Magda and her mother pulled out of the school driveway, Magdalena asked her mother what \u201clice\u201d were.\n\u201cBugs,\u201d her mother said, and she immediately looked in the rearview mirror.\n\u201cNo. I was just wondering what it was.\u201d Magda looked in the side mirror at Raven as they pulled away. Raven grew smaller and smaller. When she was finally out of sight, Magda unbraided all her hair.\nErin Estrada Kelly published more than 30 short stories worldwide. She\u2019s been nominated for the Philippines Free Press Literary Award and the Pushcart Prize.

The best treasurer of this wealth is none other than our beloved grandmothers. Whether it is a cure for skin irritation or a remedy for dull hair, granny\u2019s formulas have always helped most of us. Here, we have documented a few beauty tips which are exclusively out from my granny\u2019s box of wisdom.\n1. Turmeric \u2013 The best part of using grand mom\u2019s beauty recipe is its closeness from nature. Turmeric is one of the most used herbs and it is found in almost every Indian kitchen. Turmeric is not only a wonderful antioxidant but also it helps in making skin brighter and fairer. To make your skin prettier than ever do not forget to mix this golden herb in your regular face mask.\n2. Cucumber and lemon to bleach your skin \u2013 How did our grannies managed to look gorgeous in an era when hardly there were any beauty salon which could offer facility of bleach and tan removing. Our grand mom\u2019s got rid of their tanning by applying lemon and cucumber juices. Both these fruits are amazing bleaching agents.\n3. Honey is the key of beauty \u2013 Nowadays almost everyone around the globe is flocking towards natural resources to maintain good health. And, honey is one of the most used natural substances. Most of us use it as a natural sweetener while my granny used honey as face mask. It was secret of her ever glowing skin.\n4. Amla for raven tresses \u2013 Grand moms look very graceful in their snowy hair. But I remember, my granny sported long and naturally raven hair till her 60\u2019s. And she gave its credit to regular consumption of amla.\n5. Fenugreek for strong hair \u2013 Fenugreek holds hair fall and makes it stronger than ever. I learnt it from my mom\u2019s mom.\n6. Carrot Juice \u2013 Tired of premature graying, drink carrot juice every day. This is an old and proven formula of defying premature hair graying.\n7. Fresh milk cream to avoid dry skin \u2013 Fresh milk is one of the healthiest ways to get soft and supple skin. Our predecessors used it as their best cold cream.\n8. Gram flour pack for sebum free skin \u2013 Till a few decades back not many beauty products were available to restrict sebum production in skin. Young women of the era did it by applying gram flour mask on their face.\n9. Tomato juice \u2013 Tomato juice is the best toner you have. Trust me, your granny would have also used it.\n10. Regular oiling \u2013 Proper oiling makes your hair great \u2013 This was confirmed by an ad too. My grandma told me, regular oiling makes your hair great and it is proven now."

                            "text": "KATHERINE OF ARAGON is described as small, with reddish hair which had turned a dull brown colour by her mid-thirties.She was considered attractive as a young woman, but quickly lost this and by the time she was in her early thirties, the King of France considered her 'old and deformed [ugly]'. As a young woman she was famed for her hair, which was very long and unlike Henry's other wives she wore loose the majority of the time. She was apparently plump.\nANNE BOLEYN was indeed described as having long dark brown hair - long enough to sit on - and large 'black' eyes. She is also described as having sallow skin. Ignore the portraits showing a reddish tinge; this was a popular attribute to add to portraits in the 16th century, as was pale skin.\nJANE SEYMOUR - her portrait gives no indication of her hair colour. The descriptions we have show her as a plain woman, with very pale skin. I always imagined her to have light brown hair, though I don't know why. Red hair was considerd very attractive; I don't think she would have insisted on all wearing the gable hood, which covered all the hair, if her hair was one of her best features.\nANNE OF CLEVES - tall, 'of middling beauty' and with smallpox scars on her face. Her portrait shows a woman with brown, wide-set eyes and a round face. We have no indication of her hair colour.\nCATHERINE HOWARD - we have no portrait that we can be sure is her; the two thought to be her show a woman with blonde-brown hair. She was said to be very short and quite plump. She died as a teenager. Some sources describe her as beautiful, others as average.\nKATHERINE PARR - Her skeleton, when examined in the 19th century, showed her to be 5'2\" with auburn, curly hair.\nAs to eye colours, I think you'll have to scrutunise the portraits; the ones on Google images weren't clear enough for me to be sure.\nAlso, of course, you can go by the eyebrows in the portraits: Anne of Cleves had dark brown eyebrows, so probably had dark brown hair.\nKatherine of Aragon had strawberry blonde hair, was of average height, and was slim, until her late 30's. Pregnancies and miscarriages had taken its toll on her.\nAnne Boleyn had long dark hair, almost black. Her eyes were almost black too and she had olive skin. She apparently had moles on her too. She was petite in stature and physique.\nJane Seymour was a blonde. Not brunette or a redhead. She was slim, and had pale skin and \"mouse\" like features.\nAnne of Cleves was believed to be a little \"chubby\" compared to Henry's previous wives, one of the reasons he quickly divorced her. She was small and apparently her hair was brunette.\nKatherine Howard had auburn hair. She is the cousin of Anne Boleyn. She wasn't slim but not chubby either. She was only a slip of a girl when Henry found out she had another lover and had her beheaded.\nKatherine Parr had brown hair. Blue eyes I believe too. She was of average height as well.\nKatherine Of Aragon - Had brown hair with a lot of red highlights and it was said she had extremely light eyes. Her family house (Trastamara)was fair.\nJane Seymour - Had a receding chin and her hair was almost white blonde.\nAnne Boleyn had black hair and black eyes (as you mentioned).\nAnne Of Cleves- Anne had copper-red-brown hair and being that she was from Germany she probably had blue eyes. She not overweight, she was just big boned.\nKatherine Howard- Had brown and dark eyes, she was considered (by Henry) as the most beautiful.\nCatherine Parr- Had Dark brown hair and blue eyes. She had somewhat Asian eyes and high cheekbones.\nKatherine of Aragon - she was described as having reddish/browny hair, and from what I can see had blue eyes. - This would make sense, since she was concidered a beauty in her youth, and the idea of 'beauty' at the time went along the lines of blue-eyes.\nAnne Boleyn - famous for her very dark brown hair! She is probably the easiest to spot, since she was fond of the French hood, which made her hair visible at the top. Her eyes were a similar peircing brown/black - famously given to her daughter Elizabeth.\nJane Seymour - Although the only contempory portrait we have of her shows the gable hood being worn, from which we can't see any hair, she was described as being very pale in appearance - either a blonde or light brown hair colour. From what I can see in the same famous painting, her eyes look blue or light brown. Many historians say that one of the reasons Henry was attracted to her was the fact that she looked nothing like Anne Boleyn, so this description makes sense.\nAnne of Cleves - I don't think that there was ever any description of Anne of Cleves' hair colour, but her eye brows are dark so that may couple with darker hair. Most people seem to ashume that she was blonde, due to the yellow/gold headdress she wears in the famous painting of her. Her eyes look brown, from the same painting.\nCatherine Howard - The portraits done of her picture brown hair and brown eyes. It is not known if she really was the 'Rose without a thorn' as Henry called her, though, since all the descriptions vary from average looking to pretty, but no more. Being a teenager she was probably shorter than some other women.\nKatherine Parr - Having more than one famous painting done of her, we can plainly see that she had brown hair and greyish eyes. One of these pictures her wearing a cap, so your doll would be more easily recognisable as Katherine if she wears one too.\nFrom her portrait she seems to have blonde or red hair and possibly blue eyes. She was very beautiful when she was younger.\nShe was famous for her dark hair and eyes. Her skin was quite pale, as this was fashionable at the time.\nShe apparently had very pale skin, light blue eyes and (white) blonde hair. She was probably a bit prettier than her portrait seems to suggest.\n\"apparelled in a gown of rich cloth of gold ...her hair hanging down, which was fair, yellow and long\".\nAnne of Cleves had blonde hair.\nA note on Katherine Howard's colouring: nobody said she was average - Marillac simply implied that she was not as beautiful as he had been lead to believe. She was probably rather pretty. And if she was pretty enough to have been described as \"the rose without a thorn\" and \"the jewel of womanhood\" then we can expect that she fit Tudor ideals of beauty - i.e. she was fair. Rather than brunette, she was more likely to be auburn haired: the portraits identified as possibly being her all have reddish tinges to the hair.\nHer eye colour depends on what portraits you believe are her: I'm leaning towards hazel/dark green, personally, but please don't think that historic fact! That's just my estimation based on the portraits I believe to be her, predominantly the miniature.\nAs for her skin, it's been reported that she was like her cousin, with olive skin, and it's also been said that she was pale: it is most likely that if she was \"the rose without a thorn\" she'd be pale, but perhaps she was not as fair as the Tudor age liked: after all, Marillac wasn't as impressed with her appearance as he expected to be. So, really, it's impossible to tell.\nThe rest of her description of correct. She was described as tiny, and if Anne B was of average height, and her skeleton measured to be around 5'3\", then tiny Katherine could have been somewhere under 4'11\". It's understandable then that she looked rather curvy.\nThin women were not considered attractive in those days so whoever said ann of cleves being chubby had to do with henry VIII not wanting her is most likely incorrect. The clothes of those days would swallow extremely thin women up making them appear shapeless. Catherine of aragon did become overweight they say but their version of overweight would be over a size 16 today. Being around a size 8-12 was prized, pale skin, golden-reddish hair (considered the color of royalty at the time), and blue eyes, and small mouths were considered beautiful. Anne boleyn was not fashionable though her eyes were considered her best feature. You can find portraits of jane seymour as a child and she did indeed have blonde hair, but whether it darkened over time or not is hard to say. King Henry's sister Mary the duchess of suffolk was considered the epitome of beauty at the time so you can see what was considered beautiful at that time by looking her up. Hair color is a polygenic trait much like skin so it is not as simple as figuring out the recessive vs dominant traits to conclude the hair color of offspring.\nJane is my fave , her hair colour was medium-light blonde , I've got that hair colour , her hair WAS NOT brown or red!!!\nActually nobody knows what hair color Jane had, it's thought it might be blonde but really historians don't know.\nAnd actually Anne hair color is never described, she probably had red hair though, given the earliest known portraits of her (The Elizabeth I ring and the Holbein Sketch) both have her with red hair. Anne's only ever described as having dark skin and eyes, her hair color is never mentioned.\nThese are all just guesses from the portrait and the TV show the Tudors.\nCatherine of Aragon: She probably had strawberry blonde hair if you look at the portraits, as for eyes, they were probably blue or hazel. If you look at the portraits of her you can tell she was pale.\nAnne Boleyn: Dark brown hair (could have been almost black, like my hair) and the famous almost-black brown eyes. Olive skin tone. If you can't tell some of her features, look at her daughter Queen Elizabeth I portraits.\nJane Seymour: This one's tough. Her gable hood covers her hair in her portraits and you can't really make out Jane's eye color. But if I had to guess, she probably had blonde or red hair (or something in between), and blue or hazel eyes. I really wish they had color photography back then.\nAnne of Cleves: Once again, this is tough. If you look at her portrait, she had brown eyes, but then, we have this strange anomaly. We can't figure out her hair color! She could have brown hair because of eyebrows, but, it's pretty weak because of my best friend's has brown eyebrows, but she has blonde hair. You could believe she was a blonde (based on one contemporary description) but you could believe she was a red head because one of her sisters has red hair. Best advice, just cover where her hair would be with a gable hood.\nCatherine Howard: A little bit easier. What I can tell she looks nothing like Tazmin Merchant (actress who played her on the Tudors) She probably had auburn hair and brown eyes. Once again, pale.\nCatherine Parr: Probably the second most easy one to determine (after Anne Boleyn) A hair sample taken from her corpse shows she had blonde hair (could be strawberry blonde, sense the hair sample has faded) and brown eyes. In same fashion (except for Anne Boleyn) pale.\nP.S. Not my actual name. I'm an idiot!\nThnxxxx so much. gave lots of help with history homework!!!!\nAnne of Cleves was notably not very good looking which is why Henry Divorced her pretty Quickly. she had light brown hair blue eyes and a fairly wide brow she was best described by Henry man like feature's haha.\nshe has blue /hazel eyes.\nbrown eye's and olive skin.\nonly biological heir to the English thrown.\nCatherine Howard she is considered to be the prettiest out of all king Henry's wives she has medium brown hair and brown eye's.\nCatherine Parr she has auburn reddish brown hair and she has blue/gray eye's.\nmy honest opinion she is pretty even though she is fair she is still the prettiest \u263a\ufe0f.\nVery unfortunate when people use HBO's The Tudors as a reference. That show was very far from historical...it was a soap opera in period clothing. With some research, one can find contemporary accounts to go along with portraits from the time. There is an amazing wealth of info found in books by historians....go to Amazon or eBay and such books don't cost that much should you want to start a collection (I love mine!). Or, heck, visit the library. Sometimes it is helpful to actually read a book rather than Google, amazingly enough. Yeah, we have to make some of our own conclusions but at least doing that gives us more basis in truth than...omg...Hollywood fancy or wishful thinking.\nYou can't go by that since the show's producers were shocked when Natalie Dormer showed up for filming as a brunette Anne Boleyn. They hired her when she was her natural blonde color and had expected that she would play Anne as a blonde. She had to talk them into letting her play the role as a brunette. So don't think for a second that the creators of The Tudors were casting these roles with any specific historical accuracy as a guide.\nCite your sources, I'm begging y'all. You can't just say \"Jane Seymour had really light blonde hair\" and give no indication of how you know that. That's not how history works."

How did you approach the situation without crying and feeling like a terrible parent?\nI see it in my sister although she is 34 she still has that middle child syndrome and constantly makes my mom feel guilty for anything . I love being the eldest daughter/sister because I think thee is just something about being the eldest where you don't need confirmation of anything because you had to learn to be independent from a young age and just to love life really . luckily I only have 2 but the eldest does tend to say that his sister gets away with anything but thats how it goes ."

                            "text": "The still night\u2019s chill pushed a young couple into the embrace of their tribal elders. Arrayed in all corners of the large log building, the bodies of men and women were gathered. Smoke from incense and pipes spilled up and circled within the roofing. Cloaked in robes of reeds and scales, six women circled a small pedestal at the center of the group. The eldest of the village took the wrapped child from its mother and shuffled back to the circle. Then, with the silence of stars, the elder placed the bundled child on the stone marker, ready to start the Illumination.\nTo begin, the child must be asleep, secure in its infant mind that all is well. The eldest of the tribe\u2014a bony woman who had forsaken her name long ago for the title of Celestaon, speaker to the stars, led the ceremony. She unwrapped the babe in a smooth motion, as she did for all children. She spoke the names of the Seven Celestial Chiefs, the great beings that hold the dark at bay. Celestaon invoked their attention to look on the new member of their tribe with grace.\nThe parents kneeled in anxiety, knowing their hopes for the child were not their own, now. Both parents had been deemed merchants, to trade with other clans and even the people beyond the land of Misten. Their fate, much like their child\u2019s, was decided during their own Illumination.\nFinally, the prayers ended, and chants began as the Eldest placed her hand upon the chest of the baby. She felt its warmth and the flutter of its heart beneath her wrinkled palm. With the subtlest of senses, she focused her Reach, the limit of her magic\u2019s influence, at the center of the child\u2019s chest.\nFrom within the babe, gently at first, came her raw magic, liquid and glittering in its form. Benign, but leaving its stain nonetheless. All mages bore such a stain for pushing their magic out into the world.\nA set of speckles would appear before the child awoke and ended the ritual. Waking would tell them the child was almost out of its magic. As the body tried to fight the pull in the only way it could.\nThe cries of the child brought everyone\u2019s attention to the end of the ceremony. Waiting for the Celestaon to announce where the new member of their tribe would belong. The leaders of each Constalari shouldered their way to the center, ready to embrace the child. After the elders huddled around the child, they called for the Star Chart to find the closest constellation match to the speckles of stain. As the anticipation grew, no answer came.\nIn quick movements, Celestaon grabbed up the baby as the other elders pushed a path through the crowd. The moment of wondering bought her time to escape the questioning and get to her home. As she reached the edge of the steps, she prepared to run across the waterway.\nAs her bare foot was about to strike the surface, she stretched out with her Reach and pushed the heat out from the surface and below\u2014a process so second nature that it took little thought at her age. The slabs of frozen water contrasted to her warmed skin, but each step was so brief most were barely noticed.\nBehind her she heard the uproar of her tribe members. This was unheard of, but she couldn\u2019t let them see the child\u2019s mark. The tribe has no place for anomalies. Every member must fit. This anomaly needed thought, and she feared the direction of impulsive Constalari leaders.\nCelestaon\u2019s home was close now, a place few would invade out of the respect her role demanded. The simple clay home was built onto a large wooden platform with stilts to save it from the harsh change in tides and the natural swamp conditions. She finally reached the set of steps to her home and turned to see a couple of elders escorting the parents by canoe. She pushed through the door and into her home, the scent of herbs welcoming her. The gentle stirrings of her guest pulled her from relaxing, and she absentmindedly rocked the child.\nCelestaon sat at a table as the door opened. In shuffled the parents and the elder for the Merchant Constalari. The arguing of the clan trailed in behind them.\n\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d the mother asked, worry etched in her words and on the father\u2019s face.\nThe parents stared, uncomprehending. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d the father asked, wrapping his arm around his wife.\nThe other elder had the same quizzical look; she had never heard of such a thing before. She stepped over to Celestaon\u2019s chair and looked down at the child, now awake. They had named her Aliene, and she was squirming with her eyes darting around, unable to focus on any one thing.\nCelestaon unwrapped the child, showing them the markings that formed a faint eight-pointed star. No more than a finger\u2019s length in diameter, but clear as day. Aliene had no marks like the rest, and her position could not be determined with such a showing. To followers of the seven celestial chiefs, she may as well not be of the Misten clans.\n\u201cWe will most likely have to exile this child; she will be cast into the other lands of Savea.\u201d Celestaon knew her odds. Misten was one of the southernmost countries. To wander the wilds alone was the end of anyone but the most experienced mages. They were forced to give her up to the wayward nature of fate."

The Science of Favoritism (*of course she would never admit it).\"\nThe cover features three blonde young children, a boy and two girls. Just like our family. Favorite girl has a big piece of cake with an even bigger smile on her face, while non-favored younger children have small pieces and rather grumpy faces.\nOf course it was the cake in the picture that interested my kids the most. Each of them has complained at one stage or another than so-and-so gets more, or doesn't get reprimanded like they do or gets better \"stuff\" in general.\nThe good thing is that each one has complained about the other, evidence that we have equally failed each child!\nThe Time magazine article insists that all parents really do have a favorite, even if it's subconscious. It's the natural order of things, just like in the animal kingdom.\nAnd just like in the animal kingdom, it seems that the oldest child tends to be the favored one. Catherine Conger of the University of California, Davis concluded in her well-known study about favoritism that 65 percent of moms and 70 percent of dads do outwardly show favoritism to one child and it's usually the oldest.\nOlder children often grow up to be the tallest and/or strongest of the kids, with higher IQs (by about three points). It's believed that these numbers are actually low due to parents' awareness of being watched by researchers as they interact with their children during studies on favoritism.\nIn animal studies, mothers prefer larger eggs, larger babies and babies born first (since they tend to be larger). They will throw small eggs or the runt of a litter out of the nest/family home in order to focus on the healthier, older children since younger ones are considered \"spares, not heirs\".\nAnother reason researchers believe the oldest is often favored may involve the care, attention and expense invested in the first child. Parents focus on the eldest to make sure their investment pays off.\nYounger siblings get the hand-me-downs and their milestones aren't as celebrated -- it's all been done before.\nYeah, I think every parent has his/her favorite child. Specially the Moms. She likes the eldest one and always ready to pour her heart for the eldest ...The other children of her suffers obviously but that is a fact that she can't love or favor her other child specially the middle one as much as the eldest...Bitter truth of parenthood...!!"

You can read the original post here.\nThe first rule of parenting multiple children is to never admit you have a favourite child. Apparently, it is not appropriate as it might cause a rift in the family or affect the other children\u2019s self-esteem. Well, I believe there is nothing wrong with having a favourite child and you should never be afraid to let your children know exactly who the favourite is.\nThe next baby comes along. She had forgotten how beautiful a little baby is to hold and how sweet they smell. The softness of her baby&apos;s skin against hers brings back overwhelming memories of becoming a mother.\nNow she looks at her stinky toddler, constantly demanding attention and screaming if they do not get their own way. Her toddler now looks enormous compared to her baby and the size of its poop is often scary. Whenever her toddler is awake, life seems too chaotic, rarely calm like when they were a baby. Today she has a favourite child but she would never admit it out loud.\nBy the time baby number three comes along, she realises that her affections have moved again. The older two seem to do more wrong than right. They are either fighting with each other, creating a mess that takes hours to get back in order or refusing to eat the healthy and delicious meals she has taken time away from her baby to prepare. Her favourite child has changed and she is starting to think she is a bad mum as her guilt settles in.\nAs her children grow, she becomes smarter and more efficient at this mothering job. Some days she is madly in love with her eldest child, as they seem so mature and helpful, always lending a helping hand. Other days her middle child will just sit and be with her, cuddling on the couch as they watch TV shows together. And finally there are days when she watches her youngest play happily on their own, their imagination spreading its wings.\n\"Her favourite child has changed and she is starting to think she is a bad mum as her guilt settles in.\" Photo source: iStock.\nShe realises she does have a favourite child and that doesn&apos;t make her a bad mum.

If she is feeling grateful, humble for everything she has achieved in her life, her baby makes her heart sing.\nThe first rule of parenting 101 should be eliminated in the rulebook -- there&apos;s nothing wrong with having a favourite child.\nMy kids have sucked the life out of me.\nTo every mother with girls.\nAn easy way to reduce anxiety."

                            "text": "Elizabeth Norton looks back to another highly-anticipated royal birth - that of Queen Victoria's eldest child.\nPart of the excitement over the royal birth was that, for the first time, boy or girl, the child would become a future monarch. Primogeniture \u2013 the succession of sons before daughters \u2013 has long been established, with Henry VIII and George III both succeeding ahead of their elder sisters. The Succession to the Crown Act, which received royal assent on 25 April 2013, changes this. When it is brought into force it will ensure that princesses born after 28 October 2011 will succeed before their younger brothers. As it turns out, haste was unnecessary and the baby born yesterday afternoon was a boy, but for his own daughters or granddaughters, the change will be significant.\nJust under 172 years ago, there was a birth as highly anticipated as the current royal baby. Queen Victoria\u2019s eldest child was born three weeks early on 21 November 1840, after a twelve hour labour, at which her husband, Prince Albert, was present. The baby, a girl named Victoria, was known as Vicky to her family.\nThe baby\u2019s delicate health caused friction between her parents, who disagreed over her care. After one furious row, Albert pushed a note under Victoria\u2019s door, declaring that \"Doctor Clark has mismanaged the child and poisoned her with calomel and you have starved her. I shall have nothing more to do with it, take the child away and do as you like and if she dies you will have it on your conscience.\" He won the battle and Vicky became the favourite of his nine children. Albert undertook her early education himself, ensuring that she was fluent in English, French and German by the age of three. She far outstripped her brother, Bertie (the future Edward VII), who supplanted her as heir to the throne with his birth on 9 November 1841.\nIt was never suggested that primogeniture should be abandoned in order to allow Vicky to succeed. In fact, Victoria was disappointed after the birth, declaring \"never mind, the next will be a Prince\". If she had known the character of her eldest son, whom she disliked, would she have changed her mind? Vicky was certainly popular and considered to be \"England\u2019s daughter\" by the people.\nBritish monarchs notoriously often despised their heirs and Queen Victoria was no exception. She unfairly blamed Bertie for Albert\u2019s death in December 1861 and thought him stupid and incapable of governing. Victoria and Vicky had a complicated relationship thanks to Albert\u2019s favouritism, with the queen jealous of having to share her husband\u2019s affections. Victoria did admit that her eldest daughter was \"so clever (I may say wonderfully so), and so sensible\" \u2013 an indication that she might have found her a more fitting heir.\nIf she had been Princess of Wales, Vicky would not have enjoyed the personal happiness that she found in her life when, at fifteen, she fell in love with Frederick \u2018Fritz\u2019, Crown Prince of Prussia. As heir to the throne, Vicky would never have been permitted to wed Fritz, with her marriage, in January 1858, requiring her to live in Germany. In 1888 she became Empress of Germany, although her husband, who was already ill with throat cancer, survived his accession by only 99 days. It was the thought that Vicky would become an empress and outrank her which prompted Victoria to seek her own Imperial title \u2013 that of Empress of India.\nVictoria was not an easy mother to have. After Albert\u2019s death she always wore black and relied heavily on her youngest daughter, Beatrice, refusing to allow her to marry until she had promised to continue to live with her. Vicky\u2019s relationship with her mother improved with separation. In particular, the queen urged her daughter to avoid the frequent pregnancies that she had endured in her marriage. In spite of this, Vicky bore eight children, with her eldest, the future Kaiser Wilhelm II, born on 27 January 1859. Whether mother and daughter would have been quite so close if Vicky had remained in England is questionable.\nQueen Victoria II would have had a brief reign. She was already suffering from breast cancer when her mother died on 22 January 1901, after a reign of more than 63 years. For Vicky, the queen Britain never had, the ending of primogeniture would not have been welcome. Unable to marry the man she loved, she would have spent her life forced into uncomfortably close proximity to her mother. Vicky died on 5 August 1901 \"alive and alert\" until the end, less than seven months after her mother.\nWith increasing longevity, future monarchs will be elderly when they succeed to the throne. The ending of primogeniture would have meant a lifetime of waiting for Vicky. Will it be the same for this new royal prince or will he be permitted to make his own way in the world \u2013 something that would have been unthinkable to a mother as controlling as Queen Victoria?\n\"Windsor Castle in Modern Times\" by Sir Edwin Landseer, depicting Prince Albert, Queen Victoria and a young Princess Vicky."

                            "text": "Summary: Jane Austen grew up in England at a time when women received little education, and marriage seemed like the only way to get ahead. Her family was poor, and when they did manage to send her to school, she learned only what she would need to know to become a good wife. But Jane was observant and she loved to read. As she grew older, she began to write about the people she saw around her, poking fun at them and the conventions of the day. Her first book, First Impressions, was rejected by a London publisher, but she continued writing, even turning down a marriage proposal to live life on her own terms. Finally, she published Sense and Sensibility, soon followed by First Impressions which was renamed Pride and Prejudice. She died at age 41 in 1817, the same year two more of her books, Persuasion and Northanger Abbey, were published. Includes biographical information, Jane Austen quotes, others\u2019 quotes about her work, and sources of additional information. 48 pages; grades 2-5.\nPros: Quite a thorough look at Jane and her times, placing her and her work in the context of her era. The gouache illustrations are charming and bring the time period to life.\nCons: Most kids won\u2019t have any idea who Jane Austen is or be familiar with her work."

                            "text": "Jack Daniel Miles currently resides in Gainesville, Florida, with his wife and daughter. Jack is a writer, multi-instrumentalist, and volunteer educator. Some of Jack's most recent work is forthcoming in the spring 2016 issue of Down in the Dirt magazine. You can also check out him and his sporadically updated blog at jackdanielmiles.com.\nJane Chapman was the youngest of three children; she had two older brothers, Christian, and Benjamin. Jane\u2019s mother, Anna, died while giving birth to her, and Jane\u2019s father, Robert, was devastated. This was the time of the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression. Times were challenging in many areas of the country, but Jane and her family managed to live a relatively plentiful, if not fairly reclusive, existence on their farm in the Midwestern U.S.\nOverall, the Chapman farm was not vast, but they had a fair sized chicken coop, some cows, pigs, and the like. The family also maintained an ample garden; they grew asparagus, Carolina cucumbers for pickling, potatoes, and a variety of other produce to sell and consume.\nJane\u2019s brothers rarely left the family farm, except when they needed to fetch a few supplies and could not wait on Mr. Camdon to make his regular delivery from town.\nMr. Chapman never left the farm, and he rarely helped with the chores. Instead, Mr. Chapman elected to spend most of his time sitting on the front porch silently smoking his pipe, or on a recurrent basis, laid up in the house all day after a night of too much shine and ruminating on Anna.\nWhen these instances occurred, Jane could usually be found sleeping up in the hayloft in the barn. Understandably, young Jane wished to avoid the ire of her father, which her brothers did little to waylay. Not that they did not want to, but over the years Mr. Chapman had devolved into a bit of a ferine creature; he was not easily handled once he was set\u2014either physically or emotionally.\nJane, come what may, still had love in her heart for her father, though, and did what she needed to in order to take care of him. Sadly, her love was only equaled, and more often than not surpassed, by her fear of him, especially when he was overcome.\nFoolishly, Robert Chapman had grown to blame Jane for Anna\u2019s death. Over Jane\u2019s sixteen years, her father\u2019s wound had festered and burrowed horribly deep into his soul. He never quite viewed Jane in the way that most fathers view their young daughters, but instead he increasingly beheld her as one of the primary sources of his inner turmoil, anger, and sadness.\nAfter the birth of their second child, Benjamin, Anna was not supposed to be able to have any more children\u2014there had been complications\u2014so Anna\u2019s pregnancy with Jane had been quite a surprise. The occurrence was celebrated as a blessing.\nAs Jane grew older, her father's despondency increased in proportion to his drinking, and the drinking had increased a great deal year over year. If it had not been for her brothers taking up the lion\u2019s share of the work on the farm, and hiring on a couple of hands who had migrated from North Dakota, Jane was sure that her father would have eventually let the farm go to seed, and drowned in shine while it happened.\nJane was expected to perform the duties of a wife and a daughter on the farm. This meant that Jane was, on a daily basis: cooking, cleaning, tending the garden, collecting eggs from the coop, and sometimes even mucking out the stalls. Jane\u2019s duties also included going into town to make deliveries and sell eggs and produce. This was her favorite activity, especially when she got to visit Mr. Camdon\u2019s store.\nEveryone in town knew Jane\u2019s story, and about her father, but most of the time folks just kept their mouths shut concerning the whole affair. One exception to this disregard was Mr. Camdon\u2019s son, Joseph Camdon Jr.\u2014all and sundry just called him Junior.\nJunior worried a great deal about Jane, and he had in mind that he was going to marry Jane and take her far away from that farm. Mr. Camdon had gotten wind of this, he warned Junior, \u201cNow, boy, you best stay away from Jane and anything to do with that Chapman family. I don\u2019t need no trouble from Bobby or his boys. You hear me, son?\u201d Then he finished the lecture with an open-handed blow across Junior\u2019s face. In truth, Mr. Camdon was more worried that he would lose his only son and cheapest source of labor.\nJunior was a year older than Jane, wanted to make his own way, and had no desire to take up the running of his father\u2019s store. Over the course of six or seven visits after the spring harvest that year, Junior not only declared his love for Jane but also began trying to convince her to run away with him. Jane, who liked Junior a great deal, dismissed the suggestion, still feeling a strong obligation, almost a debt, to her father and brothers.\nAfter a time, Jane took less joy in her visits into town and even began avoiding the Camdon\u2019s store, when she could. In a vain effort to avoid detection, Jane would wear her bonnet and keep her head down when passing nearby. Then, during one particular visit into town, one in which Jane kept her head a little lower and her bonnet pulled a little further forward in order to hide a still healing bruise, Junior, in his diligence, spotted her and hurriedly went out to speak with her.\nJunior made a good argument, and everything seemed well enough planned out to Jane. With the still tender bruise under Jane\u2019s eye, and with what Junior had said about her mother, Jane finally acquiesced. Yet, just as with so many events since Jane\u2019s birth, not all would go according to plan.\nThat night, after Jane believed that everyone was asleep, she packed a small rucksack with some clothes and a few dollars that she had been hoarding. Jane quietly exited the house and crept to the edge of the porch stairs; she stopped and stood for a moment. Jane looked out, for what she believed would be one last time, over the moonlit lawn and the meadow just beyond.\nUnexpectedly, Jane heard a noise from the far side of the porch in the shadows, and grasped that she was not alone. \"Where you think you're goin', girl,\" Christian said in a light whisper, as he sat hidden from the moonlight on the porch swing.\nOf course, as the saying goes: Speak of the wolf and the wolf is at the door.\n\u201cWhat in the hell\u2019s goin\u2019 on out here, sound like a buncha mice havin\u2019 church!\u201d Mr. Chapman said, his words a touch slurred, flinging open the door and stumbling halfway out onto the porch.\n\u201cNothin\u2019 pop, go back to bed,\u201d Christian said boldly.\nJane did not even glance back before snatching Junior\u2019s hand and taking off toward the road. \u201cCome on!\u201d Jane yelled.\nChristian, withdrawing from the shadows, leveled the gun and slowly began to approach his father. Mr. Chapman, now at the edge of the stairs, seemed fixated on the image of his daughter making her way from the house with Junior. Christian continued to advance, but in his inexperience he drew too near, and in an instant his father had turned and lunged for the gun, a struggle began.\nAs Jane and Junior were running hand in hand, less than fifty or so yards from the house, Jane heard the 12 gauge go off once, and then twice. On the second shot, she was violently pulled backward as if suddenly anchored to the ground.\nAs Jane gained her senses and rolled over, she saw Junior lying chest down in the grass, head to the side, his eyes glazed, and his jaw slack. She looked up to the porch and saw the giant silhouette of her father alone in the moonlight with the shotgun. Jane then saw a great flash, heard the 520 tear through the night one last time, and saw her father\u2019s figure crumble and spill down the porch stairs.\nJane, a scream caught in her throat, in a delirium, tried to run back to the house, making it just over halfway before collapsing. At that moment, Benjamin was fearfully creeping outside to see what the hellish ruckus was about. Eyes wide, he looked out upon Jane, and they stared in silence as Benjamin tried to fathom the calamity before him. Jane soon broke the connection and turned away from the farmhouse. For what seemed like an eternity, Jane stood in the moonlight and gazed absently out beyond the endless meadow to where she imagined the truck was sitting, waiting to take its passengers to their new life."

                            "text": "Jane and I grew up together. We were raised by Christian parents in the same Lutheran congregation. We were confirmed together, enjoyed youth group together, and were bridesmaids in each other\u2019s weddings. But, our paths in life were very, very different.\nWhen Jane was a senior in high school, she began dating a college man. He made Jane feel special. She was flattered to receive the attention of an \u201colder\u201d man. But, he was not a Christian nor did he share Jane\u2019s values or dreams. Things began to move fast. The pressure was on. Jane let her emotions take the lead. The relationship changed when she and her boyfriend became sexually intimate. Marriage was the next step for a \u201cgood\u201d Christian girl.\nMarriage had always been something Jane dreamed of. But, doubting God\u2019s good plan for her life, Jane hurried things along. Worried that she might be left behind, she crossed protective boundaries to make choices based on feelings and fear. I\u2019m convinced that Jane loved her husband and he loved Jane \u2013 the best he could. But, without God, he could not truly cover his wife and love her patiently, kindly and unselfishly. In time, they moved far away from her parents, friends, and church family. She was not encouraged to find a new church family. It was too easy to remain anonymous and, thus, accountable to no one.\nWhen Jane gave birth to their first child, she wanted to be the kind of mom her mother was. But, she failed to trust that God would help her in that vocation. In fact, she didn\u2019t see it as a vocation. Not only was Jane intimidated by motherhood, she believed her identity would be found outside the home.\nShe did find an identity outside the home. She was good at her job in the business world. But, her choices left her heart and soul in conflict. Choosing day care, she believed her child was in expert hands\u2026 more expert than her own. Choosing more worldly friends, she was more easily tempted. She developed a critical spirit and became discontent at home.\nJane became pregnant with a second child, but her husband was not the father. There was an abortion. Then divorce. Jane quickly found herself a single parent in a cold, lonely and confusing world.\nI was well aware of my friend\u2019s divorce, but I didn\u2019t know about the abortion. Wouldn\u2019t you know it? I had just become involved in Lutherans For Life. I was speaking up about the sanctity of each human life \u2014 born or unborn. One day, I briefly mentioned my involvement to Jane in a letter. Jane\u2019s angry response left me stunned and in shock. Our friendship began to unravel, but I didn\u2019t know why. All of a sudden, it seemed Jane and I didn\u2019t have anything in common. She was a successful career woman, I was a stay-at-home mom. Jane was surrounded by feminist friends, I was surrounded by Christian family and church friends.\nEach time we visited, Jane trusted me with a little more of her story. By the time the Spirit encouraged Jane to tell me about the abortion, the Spirit had also prepared me with a warm and welcoming heart.\nWrong choices are made when we are fearful and fail to trust God.\nWe are easy prey for Satan when we doubt God.\nIt is seldom a good idea for young girls to take up with older men.\nWe are more vulnerable without Christian friends.\nMen may not want to hurt women, but they do when they don\u2019t remember God\u2019s Word and use it.\nAbortion doesn\u2019t return a woman to an un-pregnant state but, rather, makes her into the mother of a dead child.\nThose who most fiercely defend abortion have often been hurt by its piercing blade.\nFaithfulness even in awkward friendships can be used by God for His glory.\nGod\u2019s hand is never so heavy that it crushes us; instead, when we confess our sin, His hand lifts us from despair .\nWhen the world deceives us and then betrays us, we have hope in Christ.\nThis entry was tagged abortion, divorce, doubt, fear, friendship, mercy of Christ, temptation.

Laura was so excited to finally be blooming. She was almost four years old and had wished for this day as long for as she could remember.\nJane Magnolia, Laura\u2019s very best friend in the nursery, was more than a little jealous. She so wished she could bloom too. She and Laura were born the same year, and had been like sisters ever since. They shared everything, telling each other their deepest secrets and giggling together over the antics of the visiting birds and dragonflies.\nJane remembered meeting Laura, Mama Oak and all the other baby trees like it was yesterday. Her very first memory was feeling the sun beaming down on her tiny leaves. She only had a couple of branches, and was amazed at how good it felt to spread her leaves up to face the warm yellow ball up in the sky.\nJane looked up to see the most beautiful tree standing tall at the edge of the nursery. Mama Oak was an ancient Red Oak who had been overseeing the nursery for many years. She was kind and loved all the baby trees as if they were her own.\n\u201cWhere am I?\u201d exclaimed Jane. \u201cWhat am I? Who are you? How did I\u2026?\n\u201cYeah, sleepyhead, Mama wouldn\u2019t tell us anything until we all woke up,\u201d yelled Eric, a tall willowy sapling planted a few rows away. Eric always yelled whatever he had to say. His leaves stuck up every which way, and he liked to wave them around for no reason at all.\nLaura Lilac was planted right next to Jane, and was getting impatient to hear Mama Oak\u2019s tale. But she was also glad that the little Magnolia tree was finally awake. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Laura,\u201d she whispered, waving her dozen or so leaves merrily in Jane\u2019s direction.\n\u201cHi, I\u2019m Jane,\u201d said Jane, feeling a bit overwhelmed as many of the baby trees around her began to talk and rustle their leaves.\nThat was when Mama Oak began to speak. Her beautiful voice drifted over all the baby trees as she told them the story of the nursery.\n\u201cOnce upon a time, when I was just a tiny sapling like you,\u201d Mama began. \u201cI awoke to see a vast meadow all around me. Grasses and wildflowers grew everywhere but there were no other trees for me to talk to. I was very lonely because the grasses only hum, and flowers giggle and giggle but never say anything of importance. Even though the birds and dragonflies would stop and say hello, they never stayed very long."

After graduation, she even taught one year of high school art classes before teaching in her degree field of mathematics and English. Jane Ellen is currently serving as the Education Director for the Monroe County Heritage Museum.\nJane Ellen wanted strong and useful baskets for her home and yard. She was interested in the art of white oak basket weaving, but did not think herself capable of the laborious process. After studying the Foxfire egg basket style, Jane Ellen envisioned the same basket using the ever-present kudzu vines that grew rampant in her area. She goes into a kudzu patch and chooses a moderately mature vine that is flexible and will not split. She found that a young vine flakes its skin and an older vine is too brittle. The vine she uses works like rope, yet dries board stiff, producing a basket with a sturdy handle and strong body. The chandeliers Mary Ellen creates are hollow spheres intertwined with tiny white lights. The natural grey white of the dried vines produces an ethereal glow as the lights reflect among the loops and twists.\nJane Ellen\u2019s creations are also available at the Monroe County Museum Gift Shop in Monroeville.\nThis kudzu basket by artist Jane Ellen Clark is 19 inches long, 23 inches wide, and 18 inches tall."

Reflected in Dizzee Rascal's genre-defining album Boy in da Corner and its impact on her development as an artist, Debris delves into London's grime scene, a pirate radio station and teenage bedroom to tell her story of self-discovery.\nSeen Debris Stephenson?

Carla Golden: Why Not Let Your Light Shine Every Day?\nWhy Not Let Your Light Shine Every Day?\nI was among the thousands who participated in the \u201cFire the Grid\u201d project on the morning of July 17. I received emails from many friends and comments on my Gather articles from others who had said they were excited about the opportunity to be a \"Messenger of Light\" -- to pray and meditate for the healing of this planet and for peace on earth.\nSitting next to my husband in the quiet of our den, I was uplifted by the knowledge that so many of us were doing this at the same time around the world. I could feel the positive energy of this combined prayer consciousness. Afterwards, I thought to myself that we need to continue sending this positive energy out into the universe and spreading the loving vibrations that were set forth in this project that we participated in on July 17. Then I remembered that my good friend, Rev. Elizabeth Haugen, had started a movement designed to help do this.\nHere is what she has to say about her new project, SMILE, in her own words. I hope that you\u2019ll check it out and get involved. It will cost you nothing and will continue the work that we have already begun.\nAre you ready to make a difference in our world? Are you willing, as Mahatma Gandhi said, \u201cto be the change you wish to see in the world\u201d? The SMILE Movement (Sharing My Inner Light Everyday) was organized for just that purpose.\nWe are also committed to recognizing and acknowledging others when they show up in positive and loving ways. When we interact with or observe someone being a positive light in the world we share SMILE Award cards with them letting them know that they have made a difference.\nIf you would like more information on the SMILE Movement, desire to become a SMILE ambassador, or are interested in obtaining a supply of SMILE Award cards for sharing with others, please go to our Web Site at www.smilemovement.com or e-mail us at [email protected] . There is no fee to become a SMILE ambassador.\nOooh. This information about the Smile Movement hit the spot! I would love to repost your information about it at my webspace to help spread the word.\nNow all we need are cyber-Smile Award Cards, (in addition to the hard-copy cards), we can download as a graphic and give out to our cyber-friends who are a positive light in the world. I would start with you.\nThe Smile Movement. It makes me smile inside and out just reading about it."

                            "text": "Photo courtesy of Lydia Waybright.\nWhen I was in high school, I started to learn firsthand that the list of demands for me to succeed, even as a teenage girl, was longer and much more specific than the coordinating list for my male classmates. I competed in speech and debate competitions where my hair had to be sprayed to stillness, my lips had to be red to perfection and my tights could never have a run. Pants were okay, but skirts were better. I was taught to impress judges by, yes, my performance, but also with my charm. To give them a smile.\nAs I\u2019ve gotten older, I\u2019ve continued to see the two different lists of demands in almost every professional environment. Women are scrutinized for things that men are not expected to do at all: dress professionally, but not like a prude; be assertive, but not bossy; smile.\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders commented Wednesday that House minority leader Nanci Pelosi should \u201csmile a lot more.\u201d Sanders\u2019 interview with Chris Cuomo on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Today\u201d was in reference to Pelosi\u2019s seemingly unimpressed expression during the State of the Union Address Tuesday.\nWith this statement, Sanders is implying that Pelosi\u2019s professional responsibilities would be better handled if she acted sweeter about it\u2014 a standard that is rarely expected of men.\nSanders took a wrench out of the patriarchy tool box with her demand of Pelosi. Expecting women to always smile is expecting them not to get involved with the serious matters that don\u2019t involve smiles. It\u2019s asking them to stand on the sidelines rather than get their hands dirty. It\u2019s confining their achievement to what their faces look like.\n\u201cSmile a lot more\u201d isn\u2019t something men are asked to do. In fact, men aren\u2019t expected to show softness. Where women are expected to be soft and fluffy, men are expected to be hard and invincible and anything less is a failure. In patriarchy, everyone loses.\nThe truth is, this is the same tool box some people have drawn from to tear down Sanders herself. For instance, in November, Los Angeles Time columnist David Horsey referred to the White House press secretary as a \u201cslightly chunky soccer mom.\u201d Sanders has even been criticized for her lack of a sunny demeanor.\nSanders used the master\u2019s tools, so to speak, when commenting on Pelosi\u2019s need to smile. But Sanders was using the very same tools that are used against her.\nIf we want to dismantle patriarchy\u2014 if we want women to be evaluated based on their ability to achieve despite the look on their face or the lipstick on it, we must stop using their tools.\nSanders may be able to sit at the men\u2019s table for a while if she demeans other women with sexist remarks, but in the end, no one wins if we continue to use the master\u2019s tools."

Created by London-based Berliner artist Jess de Wahls, who I interviewed for my Exploring Creativity blog series, the show featured huge sculptural portraits of inspirational women which were all hand made by Jess from recycled textiles, and was a resounding success. After a busy year where she had her work exhibited at the Twilight Gallery in Seattle and the headquarters of world famous embroidery firm Hand & Lock in London, Jess has started a fundraising campaign for her next project #STOPJECTIFY.\nShe is currently raising money via a crowd-funding campaign on Indiegogo, for an extraordinary and inspiring central London group exhibition \u2018exploring the damaging effects of objectification through art \u2013 imagining an alternative more compassionate reality for all\u2019.\nI talk regularly with people about topics such as Feminism, gender inequalities, sexism and the constant objectification many of us face day in and day out. After yet another defeatist comment like \u2018Nothing you can do about it\u2019 and \u2018I see your point, but we all know that\u2019s not going to change in your life-time\u2019 I figured, like Michael Jackson already sung\u2026 If you wanna make the world a better place TAKE A LOOK AT YOURSELF AND MAKE A CHANGE!\nThe exhibition will display art that does the following things: defines objectification as one of our universal root problems; addresses gender inequalities and social taboos with regard to objectification; explores the difference between consensual roleplay and everyday misogyny; and imagines an alternative, more compassionate reality where people are more conscious of their behaviours towards others. Another feminist masterpiece in the making! Jess has already had some fantastic submissions from artists across the world, but really needs your help to raise the cash needed for venue costs, set up, take down, marketing and any other help that she needs to pull this off! Please check out the #STOPJECTIFY Indiegogo page and help make this fantastic art show a reality."

                            "text": "My little artist, Gwyn, age 7, is currently working her way through the Level 1 (she has one more to go) art DVDs by Creating a Masterpiece. A few months ago she completed the Sunflower Lessons in Pencil Drawing and Rainbow Butterfly Silk Dying be sure to read our review on these two lessons.\nGwyn absolutely ADORES Sharon and she has even had the privilege of meeting Sharon a few times at homeschool conventions. Gwyn was thrilled when Sharon asked if she could display Gwyn's work at one of the conventions. I recently told Gwyn that Creating a Masterpiece would be in Atlanta for the SE Homeschool Expo in July and Gwyn immediately replied, \"Please mommy can I go, I want show Sharon my turtle.\" Sharon is a fabulous instructor and the connection she makes with children over a DVD is amazing. Each time Gwyn creates a masterpiece she cannot wait for Sharon to see it....I only wish we didn't live thousands of miles away from each other. But thanks to the internet Sharon is able to see Gwyn's creations via Faceboook and our blog and she takes the time to comment on each of them and provide encouragement. So be sure to share your photos of your families creations on the Creating A Masterpiece Facebook Page!\nThis post will highlight the following 3 Level 1 DVDS: Earthenware Sculpture The Turtle, Colored Pencil Tropical Clown Fish, Acrylic Carribbean Lighthouse. But first here is some information about Creating A Masterpiece.\nI highly recommend (especially if you have younger children) that you watch the DVD through once or twice prior to starting the project. This will allow your child to soak in all the information and understand each step thoroughly before getting started. This will help ease any worries or frustration (trust me)!\nI personally utilize the 20% discount Micheals gives to homeschoolers (just show some kind of proof you homeschool like a declaration of intent, homeschool buyers co-op id card). Plus you can also still use a 40% off coupon on top of the educator discount. We have been purchasing the Artist Loft materials (from Michaels) which are very inexpensive and decent quality.\nBelow I have a breakdown of each DVD we received, pictures of Gwyn's finished masterpieces and some more specific thoughts.\nThis DVD takes students step-by-step through the process of creating a beautiful, colorful fish on bristol paper using colored pencils. Children will first draw their fish using a pencil. Sharon will explain how to use simple shapes to create a clown fish. Then children will then use colored pencils to create an effect that looks like paint (and yes when I posted her picture on my Facebook wall all my friends thought it was paint). Children will learn about how to blend 6 simple colors (believe it or not there is no orange) to create additional colors. The materials for this lesson include bristol paper and colored pencils (scarlet lake, white, black, yellow, photo blue, indigo blue).\nGwyn did fabulous with this project and needed no help. She loved adding her own special touches to her masterpiece like the seaweed and swishing fish tail. We purchased a black from from Dollar Tree to display her artwork.\nThis DVD takes students step-by-step through the process of painting a Caribbean Lighthouse using acrylics on canvas. The DVD explains how to use acrylic paints, how to break up your canvas into sections, shading and more. The materials for this lesson include a canvas 11\"x14\", brushes (several sizes) and acrylic paint (black, cadmium yellow, cadmium red, blue and white).\nGwyn practiced on a sheet of paper a few times before she did her final project on the canvas (she is quite the perfectionist). Believe it or not there is not much pencil drawing in this project. Gwyn did pretty well with this one too, I only needed to help her with taping off the lighthouse. And she of course added her own details, like the flying birds. We did find acrylic paint a little more difficult to work with, but the end result was beautiful. Gwyn even named her island, cattail forest. Gwyn created this masterpiece just a few weeks before we got to visit and tour a real lighthouse in South Carolina. The combination of this artwork and our trip sparked an interest to learn more. So in a few month we will be doing a lighthouse unit study.\nThis DVD takes students step-by-step through the process of sculpting a turtle. The DVD explains how to work with clay, make textures and use crackle paint. It really is quite amazing how the textured wrinkles really bring the sculpture to life and make it look like a real turtle. The materials for this lesson include 2 lbs of self hardening clay, sealer spray, kroma crackle and acrylic paint (raw sienna veridian and black).\nGwyn had a lot of fun with this one and learned all about patience as well! This project spanned over a few days because you must allow time for drying of the clay, paint, crackle and sealer. So be sure you talk about the process before starting because as I am sure you know little ones want instant results and have trouble waiting! The only issue we encountered with this project was not being able to find the kroma crackle at local stores. So we improvised and tried two different products as replacements, one didn't work that great but the other did. So if you wish to use the kroma I suggest ordering it online prior to beginning. As you can see Gwyn really added her own touches on this one and decided to create a beautiful sea turtle for their beach themed bathroom in our new house. She needed very little help with this one and used one of our New Leaf Publishing science books as inspiration for her turtle. One other quick note about this project is that it can be fragile especially if a leg, head or tail is not attached correctly so make sure your children know to be gentle. We did have one leg fall off, but Gwyn told me not to worry because Mrs. Sharon said you can just glue it back on...which is just what we did!\nThese 3 DVDs really provided great lessons on color for us. Gwyn learned all about shade variations, blending, the color wheel, color theory, etc. We also even dug a little deeper and explored where names like ultramarine, cadmium come from, this website was very helpful.\nEven Rowyn my 6 year old son got involved in the lessons. He generally prefers to play with his Legos and doesn't really care to \"do art.\" However when he sees the masterpieces his big sister creates he gets a little more intrigued each time and wants to give it a try.\nAll of the skills learned in these DVDs can easily be applied to other other creations. Encourage your children to use the skills they have learned to create additional masterpieces.\nRecently I took an old scrapbook organizer and turned it into an art supply organizer for Gwyn. Now she can easily take her supplies anywhere including outdoors. Shhh don't tell her but I am getting her an art isle for her new bedroom.\nI liked these DVDs A LOT. The turtle was the most fun. I liked working with the clay and painting. I learned that you have to wet the clay to make it smooth. When I painted my Caribbean lighthouse I learned how to use tape to mask off a shape. When I made my clown fish I learned how to blend colors together to make it orangey looking and like it was painted. Mrs. Sharon is a great teacher. She is really, really good at making art. My daddy is an artist too and is proud of me when I make pretty pictures.\nYou can purchase these art curriculum DVDs directly off the Creating a Masterpiece website. Each lesson is $35.00 or you can purchase an entire level (6 DVDs) for $179.00.\nUse the coupon code setof6 to choose ANY six DVDs you want for $179.00 the coupon codes saves you $31.00!!!\nWow! This sounds awesome! I love the Sea Turtle project.\nI saw their booth and spoke with them in depth at the Great Homeschool Convention in March in Greenville. It looks like a great product.\nThat sounds great! I may just have to consider this for next year.\nI don't think I've ever heard of Creating a Masterpiece. Your kids art work is great! Thanks for the review.\nWow, that sounds like a GREAT program. I'll have to check it out for my little band of art lovers!\nI am impressed! I think that DVD instruction for art is the way to go, for sure. Tell Gwyn I love her turtle!\nI really like this idea. The dvd seems like a good idea in that you could pause it when needed etc. Thanks for the review."

When her husband dies, Harry decides to create her own masterpiece, Maskings. She shows three different pieces of her artwork using three different men who will pose as the artists. The plan is to reveal her deception, and to reveal the art world\u2019s preference of male artists, once all three shows have taken place. But when the final artist, Rune, refuses to acknowledge that she was the artist behind \u201chis\u201d work, the art world doubts the veracity of her masterpiece and her claims.\nThe Blazing World is told from various points of view collected after Harry\u2019s death. The story is told through Harry\u2019s journal entries, industry articles, and interviews with her lover, children, and others. This doesn\u2019t detract from the continuity of the story, but allows it to flow nicely while providing alternating points of view.\nHarry\u2019s frustrations and convictions are all-encompassing for her, overwhelming her both personally and professionally, and are clearly documented throughout the story. Unfortunately, while they were documented, often to the point of tedium, I never felt them. The book is intelligent to a fault. While I am not an uneducated person, I am also not an expert in philosophers or artists, nor do I want to have to be in order to enjoy a story. Harry\u2019s in-depth knowledge of these fields, and the constant references to them, and the overwhelming footnotes, detracted from the story. A book full of knowledge, but without much heart.\nThis entry was posted in Adult, Book Discussions, Fiction and tagged blazing world, siri hustvedt. Bookmark the permalink."

It is so simple that the least technical employee will be comfortable and powerful enough to exceed every gallery's needs. Manage your inventory, track your clients, replace Constant Contact, pay artist consignments, synchronize your web site, run online auctions! Complete sales in seconds while keeping your accounting data synchronized. Masterpiece handles all of your day to day gallery operations.\nMasterpiece Manager Reviews Recently Reviewed!\nWe recently upgraded to version 11 and the accompanying new website. One word ...Awesome!\nPros: Very intuitive. No longer need constant contact. REAL TIME DATA on our website. Having the photos in this POS / Inventory system which automatically feeds the website at the time of item setup. Once an item sells the items shows a red dot on the web, showing it sold, and then the item is automatically taken off the website 3 days later. This is eliminating the need for 1 full time employee between the website updates automatically taking place and the email/client information always update and not having to know another system (constant contact, etc.).\nThe team was professional, suggestive, and VERY timely upon all requests made. Really felt like they are \"in it to win it\" and that my success is truly their success! Great software always improving!\nCons: Must export the data to excel for printed reports. Would like to see the data on my screen including photos and simply print all the data. Not just a browse screen shot but the full data including scroll down data.\nThank you so much for the kind words, Cindy. We are thrilled that Masterpiece is making things easier for West Lives On. We will be contacting you to discuss the data export suggestions you've made.\nThey Know the Art Business and What Galleries Need.\nPros: Working with the team at Masterpiece Manager has been wonderful. They have developed a software that keeps my art gallery organized with inventory. Masterpiece is an incredible time-saver with real-time website updating upon a sale and upon adding new inventory.\nCons: The only con that I see is the difference in how our website and newsletter is viewed from a desktop computer to a cell phone or other hand-held device. We were able to over-ride this within the newsletter by adding images of text vs body copy. This quick change has allowed us to use our branded font and it show correctly no matter what device / computer system / email system our newsletter is viewed on.\nOverall: Masterpiece is an incredible time-saver with real-time website updating upon a sale and upon adding new inventory. Customer service is out of this world! the team respond quickly and positively to anything we need. They are a dream to work with. Having come from years working with ArtCloud, I am very happy with my decision to work with Masterpiece Manager for my gallery inventory, POS, website, artist commission reports, and e-mail marketing.\nPros: We have been with Masterpiece for almost 15 years now and have gone through all stages of the software since. Version 11 is extremely good and offers everything that we need to run our fairly complex business. Impossible to list all the features we use, but we like most the seamless integration into the web site and the fact that it is all cloud based now.\nCons: The previous versions had a few flaws but 11 seem to have overcome all that.\nOverall: What I appreciate most is that it feels more like a partnership than just buying an out of the box software. We have evolved alongside and the Masterpiece team listens to suggestions and responds quickly.\nYour words are most appreciated, Christian. You and your team has been invaluable in helping Masterpiece get better through the years. Thank you for pushing us with high expectations and for all of your patience and support.\nGreat, chill and easy software that flows.\nPros: The ease and simplicity along with the comprehensive understanding of how a business works and how this integrates with business.\nCons: I actually like everything.

Everything you need to know or view is together - no more separate systems. Love how our website is attached to our inventory and is updated in real time as inventory is added and sold.\nLuana - thanks to you and to Issaacs Art Center for allowing us to assist in your efforts to support Hawaii Prep Academy. You folks are the very best.\nThank you for your kind review. While your words were very positive I see that Customer Support and Features did not receive top marks from you. These are normally areas where we receive our highest ratings. Can I ask what we can do better for you to be totally satisfied with Masterpiece?\nMy business is operating more efficiently and I'm making more money. Customer service is superb.\nPros: It is intuitive. Integrates with my quickbooks, auction abilities, seamless push of my products to my website and Masterpiece Online.\nThank you, Ben for your very kind words. We are proud to be able to support all of the success you have had with LH Selman.\nPros: Masterpiece is always innovating and improving and support is top notch. The software is full of functionality and has lots of capabilities.\nCons: I would prefer to have all fields available to me when searching for transactions. But I understand that less makes software less complicated and easier to use.\nCons: Very little that I don't like, perhaps formatting labels was an issue but I figured it out. We don't use the website option because we have our own.\nThank you, Janet. It has been a pleasure supporting you and Motoko Original Art for so many years!\nA very useful software to manage art collections (of any size).\nPros: If you have ever worked with art pieces, you'll understand the struggle finding a software that really gets the complexity of it all. This software does. Whether you're an artist, a collector or a gallery/museum manager, this is a very useful software.\nIt comes from 1994, so they know what their doing. And now it's cloud based and comes with mobile apps which is fantastic to this accelerated world we live in.\nBut it not only register your art pieces, it also gives you an e-commerce and and an invoice feature. And the integration of everything is seamless.\nPrices are fair considering all it offers.\nCons: It will take a while to learn how to use it wisely, but it is worth it.\nOverall: Art is a global business nowadays and Masterpiece Manage makes it easier for you to jump in the game.\nMaria, thank you for your gracious review. We greatly appreciate it.\nPlease remember that your subscription includes training and technical support.

Give yourself a try and enter the easiest way to see and purchase art.\nCons: As a picky Designer/Artist, i could say that the interface may need a more creative way to display options. Esthetics aside, i don't have another complain about it.\nOverall: I can promote myself as an artist and i can be in contact with what's new.\nPros: The software is easily navigated, the team adapted the software to our specifications for our use in Australia. Even the less experienced employees can use this fail safe system.\nCons: Because the software is Unite States based the date on the program dosent match our Australian time.\nHey Coral. Thank you so much for the kind words. We love you folks!\nPros: The ease at which everything works together.

The air was thick with tension, a palpable sense of unease that hung like a challenge.

A thin curtain separates this little oasis of light from the rest of the world. Outside, the night hasn't yet surrendered to dawn and the sky and the world shift between shades of blue, as if uncertain whether it's time for light or darkness. There are no trees outside, only bare mountains, rock and stone, but beautiful in a hard way and not inhospitable. Inside, on the cool floor, a cold breeze rippling across the room, I sit crosslegged, covered with some kind of dark, woollen shawl or robe, only my face uncovered as I drink hot, spicy, unfamiliar tea through a small earthern pot.\nFor years, this image has fixed itself in my mind. Where it came from, I cannot say. Perhaps from a short movie clip watched between forty winks. Or a figment thrown up my the imagination, on reading a piece of writing somewhere. I don't know where it springs from, but it stays and fills me with a longing I can't describe. It makes me want to go to places with exotic names like Istanbul and Samoa and Casablanca.

Any more? said the whistling gentleman. No more, replied Job Trotter. Mr. Pickwick paid, the door was unbolted, and out they came; the uncombed gentleman bestowing a friendly nod upon Mr. Roker, who happened to be passing at the moment. From this spot, Mr. Pickwick wandered along all the galleries, up and down all the staircases, and once again round the whole area of the yard. The great body of the prison population appeared to be Mivins, and Smangle, and the parson, and the butcher, and the leg, over and over, and over again. There were the same squalor, the same turmoil and noise, the same general characteristics, in every corner; in the best and the worst alike. The whole place seemed restless and troubled; and the people were crowding and flitting to and fro, like the shadows in an uneasy dream. I have seen enough, said Mr. Pickwick, as he threw himself into a chair in his little apartment. My head aches with these scenes, and my heart too. Henceforth I will be a prisoner in my own room. And Mr. Pickwick steadfastly adhered to this determination. For three long months he remained shut up, all day; only stealing out at night to breathe the air, when the greater part of his fellow-prisoners were in bed or carousing in their rooms. His health was beginning to suffer from the closeness of the confinement, but neither the often-repeated entreaties of Perker and his friends, nor the still more frequently-repeated warnings and admonitions of Mr. Samuel Weller, could induce him to alter one jot of his inflexible resolution."

His sitting-room was the first-floor front, his bedroom the second-floor front; and thus, whether he were sitting at his desk in his parlour, or standing before the dressing- glass in his dormitory, he had an equal opportunity of contemplating human nature in all the numerous phases it exhibits, in that not more populous than popular thoroughfare. His landlady, Mrs. Bardell-- the relict and sole executrix of a deceased custom-house officer--was a comely woman of bustling manners and agreeable appearance, with a natural genius for cooking, improved by study and long practice, into an exquisite talent. There were no children, no servants, no fowls. The only other inmates of the house were a large man and a small boy; the first a lodger, the second a production of Mrs. Bardell's. The large man was always home precisely at ten o'clock at night, at which hour he regularly condensed himself into the limits of a dwarfish French bedstead in the back parlour; and the infantine sports and gymnastic exercises of Master Bardell were exclusively confined to the neighbouring pavements and gutters. Cleanliness and quiet reigned throughout the house; and in it Mr. Pickwick's will was law.\nTo any one acquainted with these points of the domestic economy of the establishment, and conversant with the admirable regulation of Mr. Pickwick's mind, his appearance and behaviour on the morning previous to that which had been fixed upon for the journey to Eatanswill would have been most mysterious and unaccountable. He paced the room to and fro with hurried steps, popped his head out of the window at intervals of about three minutes each, constantly referred to his watch, and exhibited many other manifestations of impatience very unusual with him. It was evident that something of great importance was in contemplation, but what that something was, not even Mrs. Bardell had been enabled to discover.\n'Mrs. Bardell,' said Mr. Pickwick, at last, as that amiable female approached the termination of a prolonged dusting of the apartment.\n'Why it's a good long way to the Borough, sir,' remonstrated Mrs. Bardell.\n'Ah,' said Mr. Pickwick, 'very true; so it is.' Mr. Pickwick relapsed into silence, and Mrs. Bardell resumed her dusting.\n'That depends,' said Mrs. Bardell, approaching the duster very near to Mr. Pickwick's elbow which was planted on the table.\n'La, Mr. Pickwick,' said Mrs. Bardell, the crimson rising to her cap-border again.\nMrs. Bardell could only reply by a look. She had long worshipped Mr. Pickwick at a distance, but here she was, all at once, raised to a pinnacle to which her wildest and most extravagant hopes had never dared to aspire. Mr. Pickwick was going to propose--a deliberate plan, too--sent her little boy to the Borough, to get him out of the way--how thoughtful--how considerate!\n'He, too, will have a companion,' resumed Mr. Pickwick, 'a lively one, who'll teach him, I'll be bound, more tricks in a week than he would ever learn in a year.' And Mr. Pickwick smiled placidly.\n'Mercy upon me,' said Mr. Pickwick, struggling violently, 'I hear somebody coming up the stairs. Don't, don't, there's a good creature, don't.' But entreaty and remonstrance were alike unavailing; for Mrs. Bardell had fainted in Mr. Pickwick's arms; and before he could gain time to deposit her on a chair, Master Bardell entered the room, ushering in Mr. Tupman, Mr. Winkle, and Mr. Snodgrass.\nMr. Pickwick was struck motionless and speechless. He stood with his lovely burden in his arms, gazing vacantly on the countenances of his friends, without the slightest attempt at recognition or explanation. They, in their turn, stared at him; and Master Bardell, in his turn, stared at everybody.\nThe astonishment of the Pickwickians was so absorbing, and the perplexity of Mr. Pickwick was so extreme, that they might have remained in exactly the same relative situations until the suspended animation of the lady was restored, had it not been for a most beautiful and touching expression of filial affection on the part of her youthful son. Clad in a tight suit of corduroy, spangled with brass buttons of a very considerable size, he at first stood at the door astounded and uncertain; but by degrees, the impression that his mother must have suffered some personal damage pervaded his partially developed mind, and considering Mr. Pickwick as the aggressor, he set up an appalling and semi- earthly kind of howling, and butting forward with his head, commenced assailing that immortal gentleman about the back and legs, with such blows and pinches as the strength of his arm, and the violence of his excitement, allowed.\n'Thank you, sir--thank you;' exclaimed Mrs. Bardell hysterically. And downstairs she was led accordingly, accompanied by her affectionate son.\n'Placed me in such an extremely awkward situation,' continued Mr. Pickwick.\n'Very,' was the reply of his followers, as they coughed slightly, and looked dubiously at each other.\nThis behaviour was not lost upon Mr. Pickwick. He remarked their incredulity. They evidently suspected him.\nMr. Snodgrass did as he was desired; and Mr. Samuel Weller forthwith presented himself.\n'I should think so,' replied Sam, with a patronising wink.\n'Thank'ee, sir,' said Sam. And down he sat without further bidding, having previously deposited his old white hat on the landing outside the door. ''Tain't a wery good 'un to look at,' said Sam, 'but it's an astonishin' 'un to wear; and afore the brim went, it was a wery handsome tile. Hows'ever it's lighter without it, that's one thing, and every hole lets in some air, that's another --wentilation gossamer I calls it.' On the delivery of this sentiment, Mr. Weller smiled agreeably upon the assembled Pickwickians.\n'You accept the situation?' inquired Mr. Pickwick.\nWith the single exception of one amiable indiscretion, in which an assistant housemaid had equally participated, the history of Mr. Weller's conduct was so very blameless, that Mr. Pickwick felt fully justified in closing the engagement that very evening. With the promptness and energy which characterised not only the public proceedings, but all the private actions of this extraordinary man, he at once led his new attendant to one of those convenient emporiums where gentlemen's new and second- hand clothes are provided, and the troublesome and inconvenient formality of measurement dispensed with; and before night had closed in, Mr. Weller was furnished with a grey coat with the P. C. button, a black hat with a cockade to it, a pink striped waistcoat, light breeches and gaiters, and a variety of other necessaries, too numerous to recapitulate."

Tattered carpets laid strewn across the floors, cowering from their own tears and the dark stains splattered across them. The paintings just barely remained on their walls, while the tapestries silently fell to the floor in dusty drips of cloth.\nPiece by piece, everything crumbled. Everything bore the weight of centuries, a heavy burden in itself. But the rooms also had to bear the footsteps of undead, of sharp talons and slithering shadows. Malice flowed through the corridors like blood through a vein. It had been that way for as long as anyone could remember.\nIt was not a surprise, for it was nothing new. Alucard had no idea when he had learnt about it. Perhaps he had always known. He could feel it now, stronger whenever he was pushed against a wall by a blow or sat down to rest, even when he leant against a pillar or chair to catch his cold breath.\nRunning a finger against a stone in the wall was more than enough. He could feel the pulse for every step he took, even through the sturdy soles of his boots.\nIt had not been slumbering when he entered, but its interest had been piqued the moment he stepped through the gates. Now it listened, watched, felt his every move. It studied his battles \ufffd his graceful sidesteps, nimble attacks and brutal finishing blows.\nHe was never alone, and it made sure that he knew that.\nAlucard closed his eyes when the whispers returned to their ecstatic \ufffdhere\ufffd \ufffd exhaling the word, sucking it back. Pursing his lips he hurried on, trampling the floor as if he could crush the invisible tongues if he only walked hard enough. Without thinking he swept the cape tighter about himself, he who did not flinch away from gigantic beasts and howling demons. But those creatures had bodies that could be destroyed. The castle reached for him with invisible fingers and whispers which he could not strike out against. He could only listen and feel.\nFeel as the floor trembled beneath him, the walls shuddering by any little touch. He could swear that he heard the windows rattle in demented rapture as he passed, casting his reflection in the old glass.\nIt longed to feel far more than his quick steps, or the brush of a shoulder or back during a difficult battle. It had tasted his blood, precious few drops spilt and lost \ufffd but hardly forgotten. The whispered cry had almost knocked him senseless that first time, when he touched a door handle with fingers which had brushed a scratch on his arm.\nBut that was not enough. The ancient halls longed to feel his weight spread across them. Every carpet craved his blood alone, superior to the unworthy stains they already wore. Every block of stone dreamt of crushing his bones, pressing his shattered carcass deeper into the cracks in the floor.\nThe entire castle yearned to own him completely, to watch and feel him wither away, study flesh melting from bone. To cover his broken remains with a bridegroom\ufffds coat of dust and cobwebs."

Her lavender hair lined the dark shadows on her face as she sat concocting plans with her servant, Xellos. Xellos sat in the chair across from her, gazing at his reflection in his whine glass.\n\ufffdSo Xellos dear,\ufffd Xellas said in her eerie, sinister voice, \ufffdDo you understand your job?\ufffd She looked up from her whine glass and took another smoke from her cigarette.\nXellos set down his whine cup and bowed, his purple hair falling over his eyes in the shadows, \ufffdAs you wish.\ufffd With that he was gone in a blur.\nXellas giggle to herself, \ufffdOh this should be fun!\ufffd She laughed as she sipped her whine; the blood red liquid quenching her thirst as her demonic eyes gazed back evilly at her through the crystalline of her glass.\nThe crickets chirped silently in the cool summer\ufffds breeze. The moon\ufffds full shine lit up the room as it bounced from object to object until it hit Lina\ufffds eyes. She sleepily turned over when she heard a sigh come from the direction of the window. She sat up, her long crimson hair flowing loosely across her shoulders and back, and gazed in that direction. Janai was sitting by the window, her beautiful red hair tumbled loosely along the cold, hard floor of the room, her lace nightgown hung loosely around her body. The moon cast an eerie, almost inhuman glow across her face, as she gazed up into the starlit sky. Lina slowly crept out of bed, as not to wake the slumbering Princess, and over to the window where Janai sat, locked in a dreamy daze out into the moonlit plains below.\n\ufffdWhat are you doing awake, Janai?\ufffd Lina asked in a sleepy whisper.\n\ufffdI couldn\ufffdt sleep. So I decided to sit here and think.\ufffd She said, not taking her gaze away from the window.\n\ufffdGoodnight Janai.\ufffd Lina turned back around and tiptoed over to her bed, laid down, her eyelids heavy, and fell asleep to the beauty of Janai\ufffds words.\nThe sun shown brightly through the crystalline pane of the window, reflecting spectrums of light across the room. The birds began to chirp their morning songs of happiness, and the air was fresh with the scent of morning dew. The suns rays warmed Lina\ufffds face as she slowly opened her eyes, the sounds of the birds filling the room, the bright sun light warming her gentle skin. She yawned and stretched as she slowly slipped out of bed and started to get dressed. She was nearly done when she heard her roommate, Amelia, wake.\nAmelia pranced in, \ufffdGood Morning Miss Lina! Did you sleep well? Say, where is Miss Janai?\ufffd Her voice seemed to be even perkier in the sunlit morning.\n\ufffdMaybe so. Well let\ufffds go down and check Miss Lina!\ufffd Lina and Amelia exited their peaceful room and proceeded down the narrow hallway to the stairs. It was much darker in the hallway, because there were no windows to let in the sunlight. As Lina walked, she continually thought about her conversation with Janai the night before. They proceeded down the stairs and to the lobby of the Inn. Sure enough, Janai was sitting with Zelgadis at a table in the diner.\n\ufffdThere\ufffds Miss Janai and Mr. Zelgadis!\ufffd Amelia said, waving to them and prancing over to the table. Lina walked slowly over, pretending as if she had nothing to do with the Prancing Princess of Perk. Janai and Zelgadis looked up from their conversation and Janai smiled and waved back to the princess.\n\ufffdGood morning Lina.\ufffd Janai said, smiling warmly.\n\ufffdMost likely sleeping in the heap where I left him.\ufffd Janai snickered. The diner was small, but sufficient. It was drawn with many windows and amber decor. The bright sunlit filled the room, reflecting from object to object. As Lina looked at Janai, she could see the light reflecting off her eyes, making their blue sereneness even more golden. Lina pulled out her chair and sat down.\n\ufffdSo, any plans as for what to do next?\ufffd Lina asked, leaning back and putting her feet against the table.\n\ufffdGreat idea!\ufffd Amelia\ufffds perk was a little too much then any of them could handle, especially early in the morning. There was the slow trudge of footsteps down the stairs, as they turned to see Gourry walking limply down the stairs, his golden hair a mess, drawn partially over one eye.\nWhen everyone was done, they decided it was time to go out and try to find some trouble for them to keep occupied in. They walked down the dirt path on the outside of town. On either side were trees, flowers, and plants of every kind and color. The birds were singing as they hunted for food for their young and the bright sun was melting the last bit of dew off the leaves. Lina looked up to the sun, shielding her eyes from its glare, and watched an eagle soar overhead. Everything was so alive, so pretty, like in a picture. A pair of majestic violet eyes watched the group from the shadows as they proceeded on, the sounds of their conversation ringing through the peaceful trees.\nJanai turned sharply, her long red hair flowing behind her; she examined the brush, but turned back around and proceeded onward.\n\ufffdWhat\ufffds wrong Janai?\ufffd Zelgadis could think of nothing more then to examine the beauty in front of him, especially that of his new mysterious companion. She was so enchanting, everything about her was like the pictures in a fairy tale, he wanted to know as much as he could about her mysterious life, and unlock it at for his own.\nThe dark eyes from the brush snickered and whispered to itself, \ufffdSoon, very soon\ufffd\ufffd Zelgadis looked around, his demon ears had picked up the sounds of the voice, but couldn\ufffdt understand it. All he could hear was the haunting echoes of darkness.\nAs they continued walking, they ran into a crossroad, which split in three different directions. The bright sun shimmered against the leaves of the trees. \ufffdWhich way should we go?\ufffd Lina looked down each path as far as she could.\n\ufffdHow do we know if we can trust you, and who are you?\ufffd Lina got trembles of fear as she looked into the woman\ufffds eyes.\n\ufffdI am Kaitou, and this is my brother Kaishi.\ufffd She pointed behind her to the man who had just caught up with her. He looked up toward the group, his handsome face being blinded by the light of the morning sun.\n\ufffdWe are know as the Fukachi Twins. That way is the way you wish to take, and someday, we shall cross paths again, Lina Inverse.\ufffd Kaitou\ufffds voice echoed slowly away as her and her brother disappeared before their eyes.\n\ufffdWell that was just\ufffdodd.\ufffd Lina staggered with her words, and proceeded to walk down the middle path. \ufffdFukachi\ufffdThe ancient word for unknown, or mysterious. There is going to be trouble from those two. I can sense it.\ufffd The others followed Lina down the path, discussing their encounter with the strange twins along the way. The birds had begun to chirp again, and all returned to as it should be, the gentle pools of water, reflecting the suns glow and warming the air around it.\nBy the time they reached Simbachi, the sun was already starting to set. The sky turned orange and red as the bright yellow sun moved further and further down into the horizon. The path was covered in an eerie glow, the fires of the sky raining down upon it. The weary travelers checked into the town inn and eat at the small diner. The sunset flourished through the windows, casting shades of fire across the quiet room. A dark figure lurking in the shadows came to a halt. It\ufffds face dimmed in the fiery shadows as the sun blazed across the horizon. Within the blink of an eye, the figure vanished in a ribbon of dark clouds.\nXellos Metallium sat in his lair, the small light of the chandelier casting flickering shadows across the room. His lavender eyes, alive with mischief, gazing upon the wilted pages of a book.\n\ufffdOh what fun I\ufffdm going to have!\ufffd He snickered happily to himself as he looked up from his book, then turned his attention back to it. His voice was overcome with darkness as he recited the chartings in the book aloud. A wave of his hand and a mess of fire and darkness spread across the room then slowly faded away, and there were shadows once more. Xellos grinned happily and vanished without a trace.\n\ufffdSo, what do you think these \ufffdMysterious Twins\ufffd, want?\ufffd Zelgadis stared into his cup of tea, not even looking up as he spoke. The sun had set, and the restaurant was lit by the flickering of candles and chandeliers. The bleak silhouetted outlines of people framed the walls, dancing in an eerie, darkened pattern.\n\ufffdNo clue. But I think that they mean trouble.\ufffd Lina leaned back in her chair, as she often did when she was talking.\n\ufffdWell they showed us the right way, didn\ufffdt they?\ufffd Gourry might have been dumb, but he did have his moments of glory\ufffdhis few moments of glory and this just happened to be one of them.\n\ufffdThis isn\ufffdt the time to get into that.\ufffd Zelgadis interrupted, looking up from his tea. Janai sat to his right, holding her cup with both hands and gazing down into its liquid contents.\n\ufffdAnyway, I think it would be best if we all got some rest, and discussed it in the morning, ne?\ufffd Janai\ufffds voice was sweet and rhythmic. Zelgadis didn\ufffdt know what it was, but tonight he felt more drawn to her. He wanted to study every aspect of her and enjoy her beauty.\n\ufffdThat\ufffds a good idea, Miss Janai.\ufffd Amelia slowly got up from her chair and went in the direction of the inn. They all got up and followed her, but Zelgadis couldn\ufffdt stand it any longer.\n\ufffdJanai?\ufffd He sweetly tapped her shoulder. She turned her gaze around at him, and her eyes seemed more beautiful then ever before. He loved the way her silken red hair framed her delicate face, and her eyes, so full of pain, so full of beauty gazed compassionately at everything around her. He wanted to just gaze into her eyes and tell her how he felt. For some reason, he had the courage that had never been there before, like a sweet magic spell wanting him to be closer to her, feeling her touch, meeting her every gaze.\n\ufffdYes Zelgadis?\ufffd Her eyes met his gaze as she turned around. His eyes were so beautiful, she thought. She had never really noticed them that much, until tonight. She could feel something special about that night, the auras of angels gleaming, singing their sweet rhapsodies of love. She loved how the sound of her name flowed of his tongue in his deep, soothing voice. Though she didn\ufffdt know what made her enjoy his company so much that night, and she didn\ufffdt really care.\nShe gazed back into his eyes, studying every single magnificent detail of his face. She gently squeezed his hands, they were so warm, she\ufffdd expected them to be cold as stone. \ufffdYes Zelgadis?\ufffd Her voice filled the emptiness of the alley, bouncing from wall to wall until it muted into the flesh and stone. They stood, in hushed silence, as she slowly moved closer too him, and he wrapped his arms around her and pulled her close, holding her tight.\n\ufffdI just wanted to tell you\ufffdhow beautiful you are\ufffdand that\ufffd\ufffd She hushed him with a finger to her lips.\n\ufffdI know\ufffd\ufffd He held her close, she could feel his warmth, he could smell her beautiful aroma. He raised a hand and ran it through the back of her hair; it was soft as finest silk, so gentle against his skin. She leaned up to him, and slowly their soft lips pressed as their silhouettes danced on the wall by the light of the moon.\nHome to the Crossing Pasts Page!\nHome to the Fanfiction Page!"

I have one in my pockets.\"\n\"It's reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeally salty! How are you eating these?!\" The vampire whined, stamping her feet a little. \"What's a bubblegum? Is it sweet? If it's sweet I want it!\" Careful, Flandre will probably end up swallowing it because she doesn't know you're not supposed to do that with gum.\nNaoki's eyes wandered across the living room, looking to see whether or not he was alone. He noticed few people, some were talking, some were not. His gaze focused on a teenager around his age with an interesting piece of hair sticking upwards; it looked sharper and longer than Naoki's horn. His gaze followed down to the quick movement of the boy's fingers, he looked almost impatient. Was he waiting for someone? That would be strange in a place like this. Well, he was by himself at least. Swallowing down what little embarrassment stayed, the demifiend approached the sofa, his eyes fixed on the teenager's ahoge once again. \"Yo.\" he greeted, his soft and quiet voice not matching with his informal way of speaking.\n\"Simple. 'Cause they taste good and I hate wasting food,\" Kyoko responded stubbornly. Sighing at Flandre's petulant actions, the Puella Magi searched for the bubblegum, and dropped it into vampire's small hands. \"Careful,\" She warned solemnly, \"Don't swallow it.\"\nFlandre is about to stick the bubblegum in her mouth, but she pauses hearing Kyoko's warning. \"Why not? Don't you swallow food? What am I supposed to do with it if I don't swallow it?\" She questioned, seeming puzzled as she holds it.\nNaegi's blush had died down to a light red tint on his cheeks, Naoki's voice taking him off guard. Flinching, his eyes darted up to the demifiend, recognizing him as the person who blinked in shirtless. \"...H-hey,\" Naegi said, voice dropping to a mutter. Geez, this sure was awkward for him. He noticed Naoki was staring at his hair, furrowing his eyebrows in perplexion. \"Is there... something wrong?\" Yeah, his hair was messy, but no one really... stared at it like that. Ah, the wonderful life of being an anime protag. No one would point out your weird hair style.\nNoctin blinked in sitting on the ground nodding slightly. \"Right and now you have to-\" he was saying before noticing the House. Sighing, he pushed himself to his feet and brushed his clothes off. Chito's training would have to continue later when he blinked back. Noctin glanced around the living room to see who else was there.\nNaoki wondered if it was possible for that hair to stab someone. He blinked his eyes in confusion at the question. \"Not at all.\" he replied. Wrong? He wasn't the one that looked uncomfortable or impatient. He would even say that the other looked nervous. It took him a moment to realise he was caught staring at the boy's hair. Ah, that must have been it. Being around rogue demons everyday must be taking a toll on the demifiend's manners. He quickly changed his gaze to the teenager's eyes. He was feeling embarrassed again, although his face remained most expressionless. \"That was rude of me.\" he said, shaking his head. \"My name is Naoki.\" he greeted quickly, trying to make their meeting less-awkward.\nA blue dragon blinked into the house. He was half asleep, relaxing on his belly with his eyes half closed. As new scents begun to immediately surround him, his eyes shot open and he quickly got to his feet. He took a few steps forward and started to look around. He couldn't recognise anything he saw, just where was this place? There weren't many people here, he looked at every face in the living room, hoping to see any signs of grey fur or an eyepatch. Where was his mother? He was beginning to think think she wasn't in the room with him. How did he even get here? His heart began to pound and panic clawed at his chest. The young dragon was unsure who any of these people were, were they enemies? He was more concerned with his mother not being here than he was of anyone possibly attacking him. He started to whimper softly; she wouldn't leave him, would she?\nSounds of distress reached Noctin, making him look around for the source. His worry was quelled slightly as his gaze landed on a blue dragon that was taller than he was. That... was a little daunting. Still, the creature didn't look particularly dangerous. Just scared. Which made him potentially dangerous. Working up his courage, Noctin began to approach the dragon slowly, one hand stretched out to it. \"Hello,\" he said quietly, praying to every spirit that the dragon wouldn't breathe fire at him or crush him. \"It's alright, you're safe here, don't worry.\" He was doing his best to sound soothing, something he was rather new at. Though reassuring a child that everything was alright was much different than reassuring a massive frightened dragon that everything was alright.\nMatteo blinked into the House, rubbing the tears from his eyes and frowning. Looking around, he noticed he in his house anymore and let out a small sigh of relief, though that won't change anything about the information he had just learned. The little boy slowly stood up and began heading over toward the couch. He slumped down in the couch and buried his face in a pillow.\n\"If you say so...\" Naegi sighed through his nose, deciding to leave the topic of witnessing Naoki's bare chest for fading away in his memories. \"O-oh no, it's fine...! I was just worried that something was wrong...\" This guy really doesn't like to let his emotions show through, huh... Although, it's just been a few minutes. Maybe I shouldn't be so quick to judge... \"I'm Makoto Naegi, Super High School Level Good Luck. It's nice to meet you, Naoki-kun!\" He extended his hand, beaming at the demifiend with a bright grin.\nHyacindiemo's panicked gaze stopped at an approaching boy and stared at his hand. The trembling dragon stretched out his neck, pointing his sensitive nose to the extended hand, and sniffed. He immediately closed his eyes and flinched. He opened his eyes again, unsure of what to think of the boy. He had an animal's scent vaguely on him, but doesn't look semitheian...but didn't smell Theian either. What was he? He said it was safe here, should he believe him? He said it was alright, but how could it be alright if his mother isn't here? There was distress in his eyes, he just wanted to go home.\nNaoki shrugged. Was it just him staring at the spiky piece of hair that made him like that? It might of been demifiend's own appearance that made him look nervous. To demons it was impressive, but to normal people? It was probably off-putting. He wouldn't blame him if that was the case. As if on cue, the markings that decorated his body begun to glow faintly. \"Nice meetin' you too.\" He reached his hand out and firmly grasped Naegi's, shaking it in greeting. \"Super High School...?\" he accidentally wondered out loud. He tried to think back to the time when schools existed in his world, but he couldn't remember any type being called a super school. Maybe it was a private school? That might have been it.\nNoctin froze for a second as the dragon's gaze landed on him. Swallowing nervously, he continued forward until the dragon could sniff his hand. He could feel the warm air blowing out onto his hand as the dragon breathed out. Noctin's other hand twitched, and it was all he could do to stop himself from rubbing his dagger anxiously lest it be seen as a threat. He flinched away slightly as the dragon did, then forced himself to slowly lower his hand. \"My name is Noctin,\" he said, still speaking quietly. \"This place is called the Paradox House. Sometimes it takes us away from our homes for a bit to come here, but it always returns us back. You'll be brought back home soon, don't worry.\" He really hoped the dragon could understand him.\nHis head hurt thinking about it.\nPushing his thoughts to the side for now, he decided to focus on the conversation at hand. \"Oh! I'm guessing you don't know about Hope's Peak Academy...?\" Naegi blinked his pale eyes curiously, a small smile on his lips. \"It's a school for the people who are at the top of the top for their talents. Super High School Level is the title they give them. Like the girl who's a popular idol was accepted, so they call her the Super High School Level Idol. And, well, me...?\" He chuckled sheepishly. \"...I was selected by a lottery, so I got in out of pure luck. But don't get me wrong, I'm really just an average guy...\"\nNoctin? Hyacindiemo has never heard a name like that before. The young dragon looked at him, tilting his head a little. Paradox? What was that? And how can a house bring him here? He didn't quite understand, but his confusion immediately turned to relief as his eyes widened - he could go home soon? He's only been away from his mother for a few minutes, and he already misses her dearly. How long would 'soon' be? What would he even do while he's here? He blinked his eyes at Noctin, the dragon took a few steps forward and sniffed his face; his curious wide eyes scanning his features. At least he didn't seem harmful, so he took three quick lick on the cheek as thanks.\n\"They're not tattoos.\" Naoki replied quietly. He had no idea what they really were actually, or why they glowed. The old man back in his world never wanted to explain to him either. He quietly listened to Naegi's explanation of the school. What a strange-sounding academy, something like that was definitely not in his world. \"Is it just a special private high school?\" \"What do you even learn there?\" He was curious how different it was from normal schools, especially if it accepts idols and chooses students out of lotteries.\n\"Well, yeah, I guess so...\" Naegi nodded at Naoki's 'private school' remark, looking thoughtful. \"It's a pretty well-known school, too, so graduating from there pretty much guaruntees success in the long run. I'm pretty sure it teaches the things normal schools would, though...\"\nNoctin relaxed as soon as he saw the panic leave the dragon's gaze. He was grateful that he had managed it without much trouble. Nothing had been crushed and nothing had been set on fire. He did a slight double take as the dragon began to approach him. The dragon looked friendly, but given how much bigger he was, Noctin was a little intimidated. He shut his eyes slightly and stood stiffly as Hyac sniffed his face. The licks were unexpected and brought a surprised laugh from him. \"Alright, alright,\" he said, smiling at the dragon.\nAs usual, the glow on Naoki's markings begun to pulsate slowly. He really wished he had some control over it. At least he doesn't have to worry about not being able to see in dark areas...most dark areas at least. They did seem to glow more often whenever there was a lack of light. \"What makes the academy so special then?\" he asked. If it taught the same things that normal schools would, why make a big deal out of it? The demifiend suddenly noticed that it was starting to get uncomfortably warm under his coat, but it really wouldn't be a good idea to take it here. If he were back in what was left of Tokyo, sure, but here? He decided to simply roll up the sleeves of his coat as far as he could.\nHyacindiemo wanting to continue licking Noctin, heck, he was almost tempted on taking a bite out of him. He did taste good, but if he ate him here his mother would probably yell at him. She's not even here, but he has a feeling she'd find out somehow...She always found out if he did something bad. He didn't quite understand why eating people was wrong, but he couldn't make his mother upset! So he tried to shake off his natural urges. Maybe transforming would help, his instincts weren't nearly as strong when he was a semitheian after all. Besides, he would be able to actually talk to Noctin then. He exhaled quickly and sharply as he took a step or two back. He shook his haunches a bit, and in a few moments he was no longer in his dragon form. Instead, he now looked like a child, almost a foot smaller than Noctin. He had darkish skin and short light blue hair. His horns and tail stayed. The boy was sitting on the floor, looking up at Noctin with big green eyes.\nNoctin was completely oblivious to Hyac's thoughts about taking a bite out of him. This dragon was much friendlier than it looked, which relieved him. When Hyac stepped back, Noctin rubbed his face off with his sleeve. So much drool. It was mildly disgusting. Looking up, he found that the dragon had disappeared. Maybe he had blinked out. Starting to turn away, he noticed the boy sitting on the ground staring up at him with the dragon's eyes. Noctin stared blankly at him for a long moment before he found his voice again. \"Wait are you- were you the dragon?\" he asked.\n\"Well... it's like what makes one school better than another. The funding, how the teachers teach, how things are run, you know...\" Naegi shrugged, thinking to himself for a moment. \"...Plus, you make connections to people who are at the top of their skill. That'd make you pretty valuable in someone's eyes.\"\nSomewhat intimidated now, Naegi looked back to Naoki, a soft sigh leaving his chest. The glowing markings was still offputting to him, but it wasn't too strange once you got used to it. He only broke eye contact to look around the room, noticing some blinkers had left, and that there was now... a dragon? Swallowing thickly, he decided to ignore it for now, seeing that it wasn't causing any harm.\nHyacindiemo blinked a few times before a small smile grew on his face. He stood up with a bit of a struggle, he wasn't quite used to his semitheian form. It was rare that he would transform before, he never felt the need to. He didn't need to communicate with his mother or her teammates like this before. Most Theians and Semitheians could understand a dragon's gestures just fine from what he could tell. But Noctin wasn't exactly Theian. He finally nodded his head in response to Noctin's question before asking, \"What are you?\"\n\"That makes sense.\" Naoki replied. That must be quite an academy, Naegi must be pretty lucky to go there. \"There was nothing like that in my world.\" he stated. Sure it used to have a good amount of good or private schools, but they seemed to work differently than this Hope's Peak Academy. The conversation was starting to bring back memories of his world before The Conception, but he tried to push those memories away. The demifiend noticed that Naegi was starting to look nervous again. He wasn't staring at ahoge again, so what was it now? \"Er, you alright?\" he asked.\nNoctin gave a small smile back once he had recovered from his shock. He started to move forward to help Hyac stand up but the child managed it himself. He was more unsteady than Noctin had expected. Not knowing quite what to do with himself he stood back. The innocent question cut far deeper than Hyac had meant it to. Noctin winced slightly. \"I'm a Desolate,\" he said quietly, not quite meeting Hyac's gaze. In the hope of avoiding an explanation, he pushed on with his own question. \"What's your name?\"\nHyacindiemo tilted his head. A desolate? He's never heard of that before. \"How come no one talks about desolates at home?\" he asked, squinting his eyes in childish suspicion. Did his mother knew what they were? He bet she did, adults know everything don't they? Of course, he just didn't understand yet that others came from different worlds. His eyes lit up at the question. \"I'm H-Hyacindiemo.\" he stuttered, almost struggling to pronounce his own name. \"But you can just call me Hyac! Or Hyacin.\" No one ever called him by his full first name, it really can be a mouthful."

His hair was short and well groomed, and he was dressed in a long coat that covered his knees.

The hoodlums and Stephen were sentenced to ten years imprisonment, while Osaretin got five years as an accomplice.\n\u201cThis is your entire fault,\u201d Osarodion attacked his father.\nNosakhare turned to look at his first son.\n\u201cYou are not excluded mum,\u201d he glared at her.\n\u201cThis is not the time or place to\u2026\u201d Osayuki rebuked him.\n\u201cShut up!\u201d he lashed out at her.\nShe stared back at her elder brother.

She didn\u2019t like the fact that her brother\u2019s outburst was drawing attention.\n\u201cHe is right. It is your entire fault, Madam favourite child,\u201d Osabohen chimed in.\nShe dropped her jaw and stared back at her younger sister. She exchanged glances with her parents. They were equally stunned.\n\u201cWe could have settled this as a family, but, no, you threw your son into prison,\u201d Osabohen added and glared at them.\nEfe intervened. He led the elderly couple to their car and instructed the driver to take them home. Osayuki followed him into his car and broke down crying. He drove out of the parking lot and swerved the car into the road. An hour later, he parked the car and got out. He opened the side door and helped her out of the car. She looked around her and stared back at him.\nShe took a deep breath and exhaled loudly. She held his hand and allowed him to lead her into Bar beach. She wasn\u2019t comfortable. She didn\u2019t understand why he brought her there.\nShe raised an eyebrow. What was he up to?\nHer eyes locked on his firm serious ones.\nShe blinked. What was he saying?\nHer eyes smarted with tears. His words comforted and satisfied a yearning deep within her.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know when I started falling for you\u2026 it just dawned on me recently that you have taken over my whole heart. I want you to be mine and I want to be forever yours,\u201d he reached out for her trembling hands.\nTears rolled down her face. In the midst of the challenges in her family, she couldn\u2019t believe that something so beautiful was happening to her.\nHe pulled her into his arms. She held unto him, finding comfort in the warmth of his arms. She closed her eyes and opened them. She saw a group of men afar off. They were cutting down the bamboo hut and ripping it apart. She sighed with relief. God had answered her prayers in more ways than she could count.\nOsaretin sat in his cell which he shared with twenty others. His past actions beclouded his thoughts. He had allowed envy, jealousy and bitterness to take over his heart and lead him down a destructive path. If only he could turn back the hands of time. How was he going to survive five years locked up with all sort of criminals?\nOne of the Prison officers approached his cell and beckoned to him. He got up and walked up to the gate. He was informed that he had a visitor and was led out of the cell. He followed the officer to a corner. They were several benches arranged in the compact space. He saw some of the prisoners seated with their visitors. A few Prison officers stood on guard. He sat down and waited. He saw his younger sister the moment she walked in with the male nurse. He wished the ground would open and swallow him. They approached him and sat on an empty bench opposite him.\n\u201cYou have just ten minutes,\u201d the officer announced and stepped away.\nShe stared at her brother. He was in a green khaki shirt and shorts. His face was bushy with beard and he looked pale. He had also lost a lot of weight.\nShe swallowed hard and glanced at Efe. He squeezed her hand in a gesture of support.\nHe blinked several times. Tears gathered in his eyes and there was a lump in his throat.\nHe nodded and bowed his head. She has forgiven him. How could she? Was it possible? Did he deserve it?\nHe looked up at her and nodded. The tears came.\n\u201cI will,\u201d Efe assured him.\nEfe helped his fianc\u00e9e to her feet. They waved goodbye and walked out.\n\u201cYou have another visitor,\u201d the guard informed him.\nHe wiped his face with the back of his hand. He was in handcuffs. It made it difficult. His parents appeared and he sucked in breath. They settled on the bench opposite him.\n\u201cLook at my baby,\u201d she began to cry.\nHe stilled his emotions and looked away.\n\u201cPlease forgive us, we didn\u2019t mean to love one of our children more than the rest,\u201d his father pleaded.\n\u201cWe got carried away,\u201d she sobbed.\nHe turned his head and directed his gaze at them, \u201cI am sorry too\u2026 I didn\u2019t mean to\u2026 I was only trying to get your attention\u2026\u201d he started to cry.\n\u201cI forgive you,\u201d his voice cracked.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d they chorused and got to their feet. They watched as the officer led him away. He glanced back at them.\nOsabohen unlocked the front door. She folded her arms across her chest when she saw her parents at the door.\nIt dawned on them that she wasn\u2019t going to allow them in.\n\u201cSabby\u2026 we\u2026 we made mistakes,\u201d Etinosa stared back at her.\n\u201cWe are sorry,\u201d they chorused.\n\u201cYou are twenty eight years too late,\u201d Osabohen stepped back into her apartment and tried to close the door.\nShe eyed them. Their mistake had cost her brother five years imprisonment. It cannot be undone.\n\u201cWe will make up for everything. No matter what it takes, no matter how long,\u201d Etinosa assured her.\nShe hissed and allowed them in. They walked into the living room and sat on a settee while she sat opposite them.\n\u201cWe have gone to see your brother?\u201d Nosakhare informed her.\n\u201cBe patient,\u201d they found their way out.\nOsayuki and Efe came in.\nShe leaned back on the chair and eyed her.\n\u201cIt is okay.

It's not being critical, you're just a very under-bathed nation; everybody knows it.\nJust got back from seeing this and I have to say that I thought it was a really good film.\nI see that RT only has it at 65% and it's being made out to be a cheap Alien clone but I think that is doing it a dis-service. I felt it was intelligently made, set characters and situations well and created a palpable sense of tension. Criticism that it's a blatant re-run of Alien are unjustified. Granted, it's about an alien life form in space but that to me is where the similarity ends.\nAlien isn't the only scary film set in space that is allowed to be made and if Prometheus is anything to go by, Ridley has no right to be the only person allowed to make sci-fi horror films. It captured well the excitement of discovery, the wonder of space and the precariousness of facing any problems up there.\nThe effects were good, you could see what was going on, there was unease and dread and it kept me thoroughly absorbed and entertained. I don't want to elaborate anymore for fear of giving away spoilers but if you like a bit of tension with your sci-fi, it's worth checking out. Try to avoid the critic reviews if you can as I think going in a little blind will help your enjoyment.\n427 of 742 people found this review helpful. Was this review helpful to you?"

The book was influenced by my time as the Educational Marketing Director at Frank Lloyd Wright's House on Kentuck Knob and by reading stories from Michael Crichton, Robert Ludlum, James Rollins, and Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child.\nSkovajsa believed he could be like the lieutenant...one day. But today he remained frightened Jakub, his mind betraying him with its paranoia.\nWas someone waiting for them? Their approach had been camouflaged by pine forests for the past two kilometers, and the landscape was such that they could see out of the forest to the rocky outcrop without being noticed in the trees' shadows. They would be most exposed for the hundred meters between the forest's edge and the cave entrance.\nThe lieutenant put up a hand to halt the group before the sun's rays could fall upon them. Out came the binoculars.\nHe gave hand signals telling Skovajsa's line to get low and move forward. The rest would cover them from the trees.\nYou know I can't wait for this to be released...I'm sure I've told you that already. :) Great snippet. I can feel the suspense building nicely!!\nWhat an interesting premise! Nice to see the Native American touch, too.\nThanks, Lyndi! The Native American inspiration came from my friend Sonja and our time together in the Disney College Program.\nThis sounds GREAT! What an awesome premise (oh, and good snippet, too!). Can't wait for this one.\nThere is a very palpable & real sense of building tension here that really resounds. Call me silly, but methinks something very bad is about to happen. Would love to know more.\nThis type of suspense is the kind that coils in your stomach--just the kind I love. You've got spot on details, both physically and mentally for this character. Fantastic.\n\"This type of suspense is the kind that coils in your stomach--just the kind I love.\"\nI want to use this as a blurb! Ha!\nAnd, luck would have it that the excitement happens while they're in that 100m span. Great stuff! Looking forward to this story's release.\nLuck--that's actually a minor theme in this book, Patrick. For good of for bad.\nThe last bit is always the hardest.\nYou can say that again, Sue!\nLove the tension in this. As always, your description is excellent. I could almost smell the pine needles.\nI went back to reread the first two snippets - yours is a good example of a sequence that really works far better with the full body of the text, rather than just 10 sentences. Slow-building tension and unease, and a strong sense that something is going to happen. Really good sequence.\nYou are so right about 10 sentences not being enough, Peter!\nGreat tension through this. I read it so fast, I had to go back and read it again!"

                            "text": "Mercy follows the tale of one family, divided between two sets of estranged half brothers, as they return home to say a final goodbye to their mother as she approaches her death. However, as they come together again, old wounds in the family history are torn wide open again, with hidden motives, grasping greed and unburied hatred coursing through this gathering. With the tension becoming ever more palpable, the night will suddenly descend into a battle of survival, where the strength of brotherhood is tested and a dark secret from the past will come to torment all those who stand in the way of mercy.\nThe key to the Mercy\u2019s power lies in the incredible tautness of the film as a complete work, in particular the sense of balance in the narrative, thematic and visual construction of the film. Mercy is marked by reflection and rhythm; there is a clear sense of relationship between the repetition of imagery and iconography (the lighter, the puzzle, the bag) and our perception of character and the motivation of their desire. There is no better illustration of this balance between perception and desire than in the symmetry of brothers at the core of the film. From the early stages, the two pairs of brothers, joined together as half siblings, form an essential duality, played out in both icy cold pauses and fiery eruptions of temperament; their animosity played out in a collision of emotions. Director Chris Sparling uses this dichotomy so strongly that it acts as the driving force for the film\u2019s initial tone, before completely transforming as the narrative progressively shifts into an alternate confrontation, one that echoes the conflict of brotherhood and plays on the notion of familial bonds.\nFurthermore, what Mercy taps into so perfectly is not simply the invasion of the home itself, but the symbolic invasion of the family itself. With the overwhelming dysfunction established, creating a rivalry filled with suggestion and mystery, the sudden shock of the arrival of masked intruders at once naturally plays into the preconceived narrative of greed and familial distain, but more importantly, as the situation evolves, it serves to create a shift in the direction of the film, enhancing the already palpable sense of unease and relentless tension. This is reinforced by the decision to play with the linear direction of the film itself, cutting back and replaying the central dramatic set piece of the film from alternate perspectives, revealing depth and adding more pieces to a very dark puzzle indeed.\nPerhaps the sheer tension created in the first half of the film begins to lessen as the narrative revelations unfold, but the balance of the overall piece is so exquisitely achieved that it remains gripping with a sense of poise that is exudes quiet confidence and overwhelming quality. You could also argue that maybe it doesn\u2019t push far enough in relieving atmosphere of tension, something that could understandably frustrate those in search of catharsis; however, I personally feel that in maintaining the weight of this morally turbulent and ambiguous atmosphere serves to leave the burden of the film\u2019s murky world resting on the audience long after they leave the theater, lingering in the mind and reinforcing the simplicity of focus that makes the film such a pleasure to endure. Indeed, at its very best, the visual tone and chilling tension is reminiscent of Mike Flanagan\u2019s tremendous Hush, and stands alongside it as one of the superior home invasion thrillers in what has been a banner year for the subgenre.\nMercy is a taut experience that works perfectly in the precise spectrum that the film establishes for itself, able to generate genuine menace and intrigue through the composure of its structure, visual compositions and constant sense of momentous dread in creating a conflict of families, wrought with contrast and symmetry."

                            "text": "Mr. Pickwick's apartments in Goswell Street, although on a limited scale, were not only of a very neat and comfortable description, but peculiarly adapted for the residence of a man of his genius and observation. His sitting-room was the first-floor front, his bedroom the second-floor front; and thus, whether he were sitting at his desk in his parlour, or standing before the dressing- glass in his dormitory, he had an equal opportunity of contemplating human nature in all the numerous phases it exhibits, in that not more populous than popular thoroughfare. His landlady, Mrs. Bardell-- the relict and sole executrix of a deceased custom-house officer--was a comely woman of bustling manners and agreeable appearance, with a natural genius for cooking, improved by study and long practice, into an exquisite talent. There were no children, no servants, no fowls. The only other inmates of the house were a large man and a small boy; the first a lodger, the second a production of Mrs. Bardell's. The large man was always home precisely at ten o'clock at night, at which hour he regularly condensed himself into the limits of a dwarfish French bedstead in the back parlour; and the infantine sports and gymnastic exercises of Master Bardell were exclusively confined to the neighbouring pavements and gutters. Cleanliness and quiet reigned throughout the house; and in it Mr. Pickwick's will was law.\nTo any one acquainted with these points of the domestic economy of the establishment, and conversant with the admirable regulation of Mr. Pickwick's mind, his appearance and behaviour on the morning previous to that which had been fixed upon for the journey to Eatanswill would have been most mysterious and unaccountable. He paced the room to and fro with hurried steps, popped his head out of the window at intervals of about three minutes each, constantly referred to his watch, and exhibited many other manifestations of impatience very unusual with him. It was evident that something of great importance was in contemplation, but what that something was, not even Mrs. Bardell had been enabled to discover.\n'Mrs. Bardell,' said Mr. Pickwick, at last, as that amiable female approached the termination of a prolonged dusting of the apartment.\n'Why it's a good long way to the Borough, sir,' remonstrated Mrs. Bardell.\n'Ah,' said Mr. Pickwick, 'very true; so it is.' Mr. Pickwick relapsed into silence, and Mrs. Bardell resumed her dusting.\n'That depends,' said Mrs. Bardell, approaching the duster very near to Mr. Pickwick's elbow which was planted on the table.\n'La, Mr. Pickwick,' said Mrs. Bardell, the crimson rising to her cap-border again.\nMrs. Bardell could only reply by a look. She had long worshipped Mr. Pickwick at a distance, but here she was, all at once, raised to a pinnacle to which her wildest and most extravagant hopes had never dared to aspire. Mr. Pickwick was going to propose--a deliberate plan, too--sent her little boy to the Borough, to get him out of the way--how thoughtful--how considerate!\n'He, too, will have a companion,' resumed Mr. Pickwick, 'a lively one, who'll teach him, I'll be bound, more tricks in a week than he would ever learn in a year.' And Mr. Pickwick smiled placidly.\n'Mercy upon me,' said Mr. Pickwick, struggling violently, 'I hear somebody coming up the stairs. Don't, don't, there's a good creature, don't.' But entreaty and remonstrance were alike unavailing; for Mrs. Bardell had fainted in Mr. Pickwick's arms; and before he could gain time to deposit her on a chair, Master Bardell entered the room, ushering in Mr. Tupman, Mr. Winkle, and Mr. Snodgrass.\nMr. Pickwick was struck motionless and speechless. He stood with his lovely burden in his arms, gazing vacantly on the countenances of his friends, without the slightest attempt at recognition or explanation. They, in their turn, stared at him; and Master Bardell, in his turn, stared at everybody.\nThe astonishment of the Pickwickians was so absorbing, and the perplexity of Mr. Pickwick was so extreme, that they might have remained in exactly the same relative situations until the suspended animation of the lady was restored, had it not been for a most beautiful and touching expression of filial affection on the part of her youthful son. Clad in a tight suit of corduroy, spangled with brass buttons of a very considerable size, he at first stood at the door astounded and uncertain; but by degrees, the impression that his mother must have suffered some personal damage pervaded his partially developed mind, and considering Mr. Pickwick as the aggressor, he set up an appalling and semi- earthly kind of howling, and butting forward with his head, commenced assailing that immortal gentleman about the back and legs, with such blows and pinches as the strength of his arm, and the violence of his excitement, allowed.\n'Thank you, sir--thank you;' exclaimed Mrs. Bardell hysterically. And downstairs she was led accordingly, accompanied by her affectionate son.\n'Placed me in such an extremely awkward situation,' continued Mr. Pickwick.\n'Very,' was the reply of his followers, as they coughed slightly, and looked dubiously at each other.\nThis behaviour was not lost upon Mr. Pickwick. He remarked their incredulity. They evidently suspected him.\nMr. Snodgrass did as he was desired; and Mr. Samuel Weller forthwith presented himself.\n'I should think so,' replied Sam, with a patronising wink.\n'Thank'ee, sir,' said Sam. And down he sat without further bidding, having previously deposited his old white hat on the landing outside the door. ''Tain't a wery good 'un to look at,' said Sam, 'but it's an astonishin' 'un to wear; and afore the brim went, it was a wery handsome tile. Hows'ever it's lighter without it, that's one thing, and every hole lets in some air, that's another --wentilation gossamer I calls it.' On the delivery of this sentiment, Mr. Weller smiled agreeably upon the assembled Pickwickians.\n'You accept the situation?' inquired Mr. Pickwick.\nWith the single exception of one amiable indiscretion, in which an assistant housemaid had equally participated, the history of Mr. Weller's conduct was so very blameless, that Mr. Pickwick felt fully justified in closing the engagement that very evening. With the promptness and energy which characterised not only the public proceedings, but all the private actions of this extraordinary man, he at once led his new attendant to one of those convenient emporiums where gentlemen's new and second- hand clothes are provided, and the troublesome and inconvenient formality of measurement dispensed with; and before night had closed in, Mr. Weller was furnished with a grey coat with the P. C. button, a black hat with a cockade to it, a pink striped waistcoat, light breeches and gaiters, and a variety of other necessaries, too numerous to recapitulate."

If the accident was caused by negligence on behalf of another party, you could be entitled to claim compensation. If your fractured shoulder was misdiagnosed, causing you further pain and suffering then you could be entitled to claim medical misdiagnosis compensation. We are Legal Expert, a trusted advisor.

We can determine whether or not you have a valid fractured shoulder claim, or fractured shoulder NHS misdiagnosis claim, advise you on how much compensation you can claim and match you with the right solicitor to take on your case. So call us today to begin your claim.\nIn this case study, we are going to look at the case of Mr S, whose name we have abbreviated for reasons of privacy. Mr S suffered a fractured shoulder which was initially misdiagnosed, causing him to make an NHS misdiagnosis claim.\nMr S was involved in a road traffic accident and was taken to his local hospital, which we will refer to as hospital N, where his shoulder was X rayed. Unfortunately, he was misdiagnosed as having strained ligaments and told his shoulder was not fractured. Over the next few months, Mr S suffered persistent pain which affected his ability to work and sleep. When he returned to the hospital, Mr S saw an Orthopedic Surgeon, who reviewed the X rays taken at the time of the accident, and found that Mr S had fractured his clavicle, also known as the collarbone, connected to the shoulder.\nHow Common are Medical Misdiagnosis Cases in the NHS?\nMedical misdiagnosis cases are more common than many people think. According to a report published in 2009, nearly 1 in 6 cases are misdiagnosed in the NHS. Although the vast majority of cases of medical misdiagnosis are not significant and don\u2019t cause any serious damage, millions of NHS patients were likely to suffer serious health problems or have existing conditions made worse as a result. The report found the main reason for medical misdiagnosis in the NHS was that doctors were too quick to make judgements and were reluctant to ask more senior colleagues for help. To avoid patients becoming necessarily injured in medical misdiagnosis cases and being sued for NHS misdiagnosis compensation, the NHS must take care to avoid these cases at all costs.\nAs we have already mentioned, reviewing the initial X-rays showed that Mr S had fractured his clavicle at the time of his accident and this had initially gone undiagnosed. In the months between the misdiagnosis and the correct diagnosis, Mr S\u2019s injury had failed to unite which required surgery. After surgery Mr S made a reasonable recovery, however, had Mr S\u2019s broken clavicle been correctly diagnosed, the fracture would have united without surgery, reducing his broken shoulder recovery time, and he would have also avoided the pain and suffering he endured before he received the correct treatment.\nA claim on behalf of Mr S the Claimant was bought on the trust of Hospital N. The basis of the medical negligence claim was that the fracture was misdiagnosed and the failure to refer Mr S to the fracture clinic caused the Claimant unnecessary pain and suffering. What\u2019s more he required surgery that would have been unnecessary if his diagnosis had been timely \u2013 and would have improved the broken shoulder recovery time Mr S experienced, dramatically. The case went to court and Mr S was awarded \u00a310,000 in NHS misdiagnosis compensation.\nHave you suffered fractured shoulder symptoms, broken shoulder, fractured joint or a broken or fractured clavicle? Then you may be able to claim compensation for your injuries. Let Legal Expert help you make your claim.

However, the novice skier\u2019s holiday took a turn for the worse when he was collided into from behind by one of his party whilst attempting an easy green run.\nThe experienced skier and snowboarder crashed into Mr Loskutnikov because he failed to snowboard within a safe distance of our client. The collision caused the experienced skier\u2019s snowboard to slice across Mr Loskutnikov\u2019s right hand, resulting in a hospital stay and a ruined holiday.\nDue to the accident, Mr Loskutnikov suffered serious damage to the tendons in his right hand and fingers which required immediate surgery to insert a new screw and plate before he could return to the UK.\nThe operation was fortunately successful and there was no need for further surgery. However, an expert Orthopaedic surgeon, who advised Mr Loskutnikov during his claim, said that the screw and plate would have to remain in his hand indefinitely. Our client continued to experience pain and discomfort so physiotherapy was arranged which assisted with his recovery. Despite these efforts, Mr Loskutnikov has been left with permanent residual symptoms as a result of the accident.\nIn addition to the pain caused by his injuries, the accident caused Mr Loskutnikov great disruption with his university studies and exams. When the incident occurred our client was in his second year of a business studies course at Leeds University. His injuries meant that he could not write for extended periods of time and he was therefore granted limited dispensation from the university examination board to finish his written exams.\nOur client managed to enter his desired profession following his studies but his injuries often cause problems for him at work. Furthermore, Mr Loskutnikov has not been able to return to contact sports or resistance gym training.\nMr Loskutnikov\u2019s solicitor, Joseph Dawson, acted on his behalf against the snowboarder, who was covered by her travel insurance company, and agreed a settlement of \u00a322,500 in an out of court settlement. The sum accounted for the pain and suffering caused as a result of the collision and covered any expenses which occurred.\nIn relation to the case, Joseph said: \u201cWhat was supposed to be an enjoyable ski break during the festive period resulted in several years of pain and suffering and which turned his life upside-down.\n\u201cEach year we represent many British skiers injured in skiing accident abroad. While the vast majority of injuries sustained on the slopes are minor, when things do go wrong, the impact on the lives of victims can be far-reaching. In this case, Igor suffered serious injuries requiring surgery and a period of rehabilitation. It also impacted on his studies as the accident happened part way through his course at university.\nIf you or a loved one has suffered an injury following a skiing accident abroad, our personal injury solicitors could help you to claim compensation. See our Skiing Injury Claims for more information."

However, Mr Stanfield was not familiar with this particular activity and encountered difficulty in lowering the bath. Resultantly, Mr Stanfield removed his protective goggles so that he could see more clearly. As he did this, an eruption of molten zinc burst onto his arms, face and hands.\nAfter the accident, Mr Stanfield was rushed to hospital and luckily found that his eyes were not affected by the explosion. His face, arms and hands, however, had suffered serious burns. Mr Stanfield contacted YouClaim to make a claim for compensation as he felt that he wouldn\u2019t have been injured if he had received proper training prior to carrying out the galvanising task. He was allocated a solicitor to act on his behalf.\nAlthough Mr Stanfield had been given some safety equipment, including protective gloves, goggles and a hard hat, he wasn't given proper instruction on what to do in the event of a problem lowering the material into the bath. It had been in the face of such problems that Paul had removed his mask and subsequently suffered burns. His YouClaim solicitor argued Paul should have had full training, and not just equipment provisions, prior to carrying out this dangerous task.\nYouClaim successfully settled Mr Stanfield\u2019s case. He was awarded \u00a37,000 compensation for disfiguring burns to his face, neck and hands.\nThink you have a claim? Get in touch with us on 0800 10 757 95 or read more here."

                            "text": "Mr Thornton sat motionless at his desk in the gloom of his dusky apartment, fully dressed in a black cashmere evening suit, his gaze fixed on a picture in a silver frame.\nThere was a respectful knock on the door. He looked up, confused. Then annoyance quickly clouded his countenance. In the doorway he distinguished the frail frame of a young woman.\nBut he forced himself to produce a bland smile.\nYet he did not stir. Instead, his eyes wandered back to rest upon their precious object. His gaze instantly darkened with raw agony. He choked. Within his blurred sight now appeared his hand, slowly moving forward, animated by a will of its own, its thirsty fingers stretching, trembling, reaching out\u2026 desperate to caress the softly smiling lips once more. Suddenly the sound of short, rasping breaths cut through the solemn air and made his blood run cold. But the instant he realised that it was his own panting, he abruptly drew his hand back and squeezed his fingers into an unforgiving fist.\nHe brusquely pushed back his heavy chair while he rose, straightened his back and determinedly walked out of the room, leaving Margaret\u2019s portrait untouched and undefiled.\nMrs Brown looked up at him with her round, innocent eyes and gently touched his elbow. Mr Thornton quickly recomposed himself, sharply realising how he had stood near the fireplace all by himself for... too long probably. The muscles in his hand cramped from holding his glass too tightly. He smiled at Mrs Brown, suspiciously searching for any pity-coloured shade in her eyes, but she had already turned to the person waiting to be introduced. Mr Thornton now allowed his gaze to move on to the unknown lady in front of him, fully conscious of how it brushed lightly along the tender skin of her bosom and neck, then fixed itself on her lips and climbed up to her eyes. There his gaze was met with a curiously comforting attentiveness, devoid of expectations or demands.\nHis breath caught but fortunately his body responded mechanically and bowed. He opened his lips, but before he could utter a polite yet hopelessly insufficient greeting, Mr Brown cleared his throat and then, with a loud voice, invited all guests to enter the dining room. When Mr Thornton turned his attention back to the lady, her eyes still rested on him quietly. She then turned and followed the other guests.\nMr Hamper shook his head and made no attempt to hide his contempt.\nAfter a moment of silence Mr Slickson leaned forward and spoke in a low voice. \u201cI can tell you this much, my fellow masters, I won\u2019t take it anymore. I have men trained who will not hesitate to beat the hell out of that rioting trash as soon as one of their so-called \u2018leaders\u2019 gets it into his ignorant mind to make a move for the engine\u2019s boiler, draw the plug and silence the looms. By Jove, how that scumbag and his comrades will regret their listening to the union!\u201d He smiled and fell back into his seat.\nMr Thornton, just about to bring his fork to his mouth, nearly dropped it. All went silent at Miss Grant\u2019s softly spoken, but unusual (and therefore unwelcome) interference of the men\u2019s discussion. But Miss Grant calmly continued, carelessly adding to the increasing unease of the party.\nAll remained silent. The ticking of the mantle clock suddenly seemed loud and intrusive.\n\u201cMiss Grant, Sir. Helen Grant.\u201d Her eyes softened when she looked at him. A warm, liquid, honey-textured gaze flowed towards him. His heart started to throb. He didn\u2019t expect to be met with\u2026 kindness? His grip on the knife loosened beyond his will.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry too.\u201d Miss Grant smiled, then cast her eyes down, allowing Mr Hamper time to let go of his vexation and, maybe, reconsider his response. Then she looked up again.\n\u201cHands can easily be replaced, Miss Grant.\u201d Mr Slickson cracked a freshly baked roll and looked at her calculatingly. Slowly he put a piece of bread in his mouth, allowing his gaze to rest heavily upon her. Miss Grant felt how her eyes fixed themselves on this mouth\u2014two moist, wide, righteous lips, lazily floating along on the movements of the giant jaws.\n\u201cCan you be replaced?\u201d she asked the righteous mouth. Its movement ended abruptly when the question hit its target. Immediate anger flared up in the pores of the coarse skin around the fleshy lips.\n\u201cOh dear, I neglected to ask if perhaps you all desire some more wine?\u201d Mrs Brown gestured nervously to one of the butlers, desperate to steer away from this unfortunate conversation or... argument, God forbid!\n\u201cYou know that I do not know you personally, Mr Slickson,\u201d Miss Grant said, throwing Mrs Brown a reassuring smile but not allowing her attention to be diverted.\nHer voice welled up from deep in her throat, comforting, vast, unaffected.\nMr Slickson\u2019s gaze now jumped restlessly from Miss Grant\u2019s eyes to her hands and from her hands to her eyes again, unable to make sense of this unexpected turn; heated, alarmed and suspicious of what evil trap she was setting with those smooth words of praise. There was nothing he could think of to silence her unusual speech. In spite of his desire to thrust her away, back to where she belonged, wherever it was, to some insignificant place in time just before this sudden, unfamiliar, threatening moment was created, before he had become aware of her annoying presence\u2026 he could do little but wait and see what this unknown creature was planning to do to him.\nMr Thornton had listened to her words in growing amazement, struggling to make sense of this woman and her outrageous courage to project her compassionate, but impossible views onto the men\u2019s businesses.\n\u201cNo offence ma\u2019am, but I do not know any of these \u2018different\u2019 workers you speak of so confidently,\u201d Mr Hamper spoke, now fully recovered and ready to charge again.\n\u201cYou are a... novelist, aren\u2019t you? Yes, I think Mrs Brown told me.\u201d He threw Miss Grant a carefully crafted, pitiful look.\nHe half-hid a stiff, joyless little smile behind his napkin and looked confidently around the table, happily anticipating how his words would shut this silly woman up for good, saving this civilised party from total perplexity by putting an end to this absurd conversation.\nBut Miss Grant still looked at him, now with a contemplating gaze.\nMrs Brown couldn\u2019t help herself. The explosive energy of this conversation was just too much for her sensitive soul. All guests now looked at Mr Hamper, anxiously, helplessly (as if to ask him for directions in this total confusion), then at Miss Grant and then back at Mr Hamper. All eyes were then unwillingly drawn to Miss Grant\u2019s gaze, a serious, almost worried gaze, which, without a trace of victorious arrogance, rested calmly on Mr Hamper\u2019s now bloodless countenance.\n\u201cMiss Grant?\u201d A deep, yet gentle voice. It was Mr Thornton who shattered the dense atmosphere. He coughed briefly, feeling uneasy to speak, yet too intrigued to refrain from taking part.\nMiss Grant looked around the table, curious to learn which of the men was taking up the glove this time. Then she recognised him. She noticed that he was not leaning back lazily into the safety of the shadows\u2014which performed their dramatic play just outside the stage of the table\u2014to carelessly watch how she would respond, but instead leaned slightly forwards, one hand resting next to his plate, allowing the candles to light the regular features of his face, with a clever, alert look in his eyes. Miss Grant remembered those eyes well.\nShe swallowed, hesitant for a moment. Then she took a breath.\nHis gaze intensified. She remembered my name.\nMr Brown, well aware of his obligations as a host and not willing to contradict the wishes of his respected guests, rose and gestured to the butler to open the door to the smoking room.\nMr Thornton, who had been fascinated by Miss Grant\u2019s passionate plea, was surprised at all the commotion. His disturbed glance, however, was quickly met by Mr Brown\u2019s commanding look, which was clearly not to be contradicted and which ordered him to leave the dining table at once and follow the other men. Mr Thornton took a deep breath. He wiped his lips with the silk napkin and placed it next to his plate. When he rose from his chair he tried to catch Miss Grant\u2019s eye, but she looked dreamily into the candle flames and took a sip of her wine, seemingly unaffected by the chaos she had just caused.\nMr Thornton leaned into the cushions, his legs loosely crossed while one arm rested on the back of the sofa, an empty glass in his hand. He was tired of hearing his fellow masters express their opinions about this unknown woman in the strongest terms possible, forcing poor Mr Brown to apologise and even go as far as to blame Mrs Brown for having acted recklessly in inviting such a rude person into their intimate circle. But then the door opened and the cause of the men\u2019s crushed pride entered the room. Her silhouette was hazy at first due to the heavy, tobacco-scented mist, but when she stepped forward it became clear and vibrant. Mr Thornton was stunned to see her standing there, in a simple but beautiful evening dress which seemed to make her shine like a precious star. But then the sacred spell, which had silently slipped into the room with her, was deliberately disgraced by a crude snort from Mr Hamper.\nShe looked around the room, her lips curled into a smile, as if to thank the men for trying to slaughter her just a while ago. Mr Brown, utterly confused by her appearance and bold words, stuttered something unintelligible and bowed awkwardly. In response, she dropped an elegant curtsy.\nBut instead of allowing Mr Brown to lead her back to the other ladies, her gaze swiftly traveled through the room, scrutinised it, then spotted whom it was looking for\u2014Mr Thornton. He gasped for air as if she had just put a bullet in his gut. What on earth\u2026? Now she started to walk over to him, calmly, forcing the others to hold their breath... and watch her movements in deathly silence. Mr Thornton rose quickly, the blood rushed from his brain, he almost stumbled, then bowed to steady himself.\nHe looked at her soft eyes, desperately searching his mind to say something, anything, for God\u2019s sake!, then noticed how her hand reached out to him. Did she want to shake hands? Only then he saw a note in the palm of her hand. She looked at him intensely while she smiled her comforting smile. He cleared his throat, then took her gently by the wrist, pretending to shake her hand while slipping the note into his hand.\nShe nodded politely. He opened his lips to speak, but Miss Grant had already turned away and swept from the room.\nThe smell of roast beef, smouldering coals and bees wax. The sound of the clock\u2019s majestic ticking. The smooth sensation of polished parquet underneath his leather shoes. Mr Thornton stood in the shadowy, candlelit hallway of his mansion, ready to ascend the elaborate, carved wood staircase to his rooms. He loosened his tie and unbuttoned the collar of his shirt. Then he remembered the note in the pocket of his jacket. Seconds after Miss Grant had left the room, the masters in the smoking room had roared in disbelief, relieved like a pack of college boys once they knew they were safe from the danger of her clever observations, then scrambled to compete with one another in a foul game of humiliating her with grotesque judgements. Mr Thornton, unwilling to be involved in such a despicable display of male cowardliness, had warmly shaken Mr Brown\u2019s trembling hand and left.\nThe words hit him right between the eyes. The candlestick almost slipped. As his one hand tightened its grip instinctively, squeezing the candlestick, his other hand let go and dropped the note. While he bent to pick it up, he could feel his quickening heartbeat rushing through his temples. He pushed his elbow against the stair rail to gain his balance, waited to let the dizziness dissipate, impatiently unfolded the paper again while pointing the vigorously flickering candle towards it and, eager to find out if he had understood the message correctly the first time, read it again.\nA mixture of sharp excitement and faint nausea spread through his belly. He placed the candlestick back on the side table and sat down on the wide, ebony stairs. He held the note in his hands and scrutinised her handwriting. It was feminine, elegant, written with precision. But the words... nothing a lady would... nothing a lady should ever write to a gentleman she didn\u2019t even know. No frills, no poetic subtleties, no hide and seek. Just the bare message\u2014short, factual, bold. He felt his stomach contract while his gaze moved along the lines. Back and forth. Back and forth.\nSuddenly a vision of Miss Beckett appeared before his mind\u2019s eye, as clear as if she was right there, standing in front of him, brightly lit in the dark hallway. Miss Beckett in her beautiful, expensive, ivory-coloured muslin dress she had worn during that never-ending evening at her parents\u2019 summer house. Mrs Thornton, his mother, was bent on him marrying Miss Beckett to secure her son\u2019s future\u2014and her own. Young Miss Beckett could have chosen any man she wanted, for she was rich, well-connected and gracious under all circumstances. But she had approved of him, so Mrs Beckett had happily informed Mrs Thornton. Not that Miss Beckett would confide in her mother about matters of the heart, but she had confided in her best friend (naturally under the strict condition of confidentiality) who had told Mrs Beckett less than four-and-twenty hours later. Mrs Beckett, in her turn, had enlightened Mrs Thornton by letter. His mother had then proudly announced Miss Beckett\u2019s choice to him. This had taken place less than two weeks ago.\nMrs Thornton had been thrilled with the news that Miss Beckett had finally made up her mind about her son, but the morning that Mrs Thornton actually informed him, she instantly realised that he did not share her excitement. While she scrutinised his face\u2014as if that would have stopped the news from taking its horribly wrong, irreversible turn\u2014she helplessly watched how a crack, as fine as a silk thread, suddenly made its appearance and started to find its way down the smooth, moist surface of his eye, frosting his usually bright gaze for just a second. At that moment she knew that all hope of a happy marriage was lost. \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that, mother.\u201d He had spoken mechanically before casting his eyes down.\nMrs Thornton had sighed silently in an attempt to calm her throbbing heart and had closed her eyes just momentarily, so that he wouldn\u2019t notice. They had sat there motionless, each seated at opposite ends of the breakfast table, both feeling crushed about his lack of romantic feelings for young Miss Perfect.\nStill, the inevitable course of life was not to be hindered by the irrationality of feelings or the inconvenience of sentiments, and so arrangements were swiftly put in motion. The fact that Mr Thornton did not love Miss Beckett was unfortunate\u2014and God knew how Mrs Thornton had tried everything in her power to find him an object of love in the person of Miss Beckett\u2014but she was relieved to find that John had listened to her plea calmly, then had dutifully accepted a future with Miss Beckett as the best option there was. At least he will be loved, Mrs Thornton had thought in an attempt to find a ray of light in this dim prospect, stubbornly pushing away the distress of expecting to see her son continue to struggle through an unhappy and unfulfilling life... after the misery he had suffered already.\nMr Thornton was seven-and-thirty years of age now, and he understood perfectly well it was time that a new Mrs John Thornton should take the stage, as his mother had so forcefully suggested to him for the past two years. Miss Beckett was three-and-twenty and as ready as could be to fulfil the many tasks of her life\u2019s destiny as a wife, a mother and head of her household. That summer evening Miss Beckett had honoured her parents\u2019 outstanding accomplishment of having given her the finest education possible, by entertaining their highly respected guests with her virtuoso piano playing. Mr Thornton had watched how, after the solo performance, she had taken in the impassioned applause with a proud little smile on her thin lips, blissfully unaware of her natural gaze which had remained unaffected and blank.\nWhen Mr Thornton awoke from his meditations and realised he was still sitting on the stairs in the dim hallway, he suddenly remembered Miss Grant\u2019s mysterious, warm, thoughtful eyes as she had stood before him\u2014her hand reaching out to him, the note in the palm of her hand, perfectly calm. No doubt. No fear. Not a single flicker in the pupil of her eye. Was she being outrageously rude? Outrageously courageous? Or had she simply lost her mind? But that evening she hadn\u2019t given the impression of suffering from a nervous affliction, which so many ladies nowadays seemed to be falling victim to. On the contrary\u2014she had seemed to know perfectly well what she was doing\u2026 only playing a different game than generally approved of.\nHow much of a chance do I have of meeting you for lunch this week to continue our conversation? An open question, lightheartedly expressed as if spoken to a close friend rather than written to a complete stranger, confidently unbothered by the outcome. He could imagine her asking him face-to-face, her head slightly tilted, a hint of a cheeky smile on her lips, a playful look in her eyes, knowing he wouldn\u2019t be able to resist such an inappropriate yet exciting request. How was he to respond to such a... dilemma?"

                            "text": "Her life depended on his name. His heart depended on her love.\nIt was a most humiliating situation. Mistress Claire Curran of London arrived at the Virginia office of her uncle's solicitor knowing nothing of the private correspondence she bore. With a simple break of the seal, she was hopelessly trapped in a shameless bargain: her hand given in marriage to a stranger to clear an unpaid debt. Alone and penniless, at first she has no means of escaping her lowly fate. But she pledges to be no man's pawn in such a dishonorable game--and certainly no man's wife. With a sharp mind and an unbreakable spirit, Claire devises to play the part of Rosewind's mistress...but only until she can find a way out.\nDevon Rivard finds himself in a maddening dilemma: he can either sell his ancestral home to pay his brother's gambling debts, or marry one Claire Curran, the fiery-tempered messenger who has so innocently tossed the black-hearted ultimatum into his lap. Resigned yet furious, he vows to annul the marriage once the debt is cleared. But as he comes to know the independent yet vulnerable and undeniably lovely Claire, an even more difficult dilemma arises. She wins his heart, a prize he thought forever safely walled away. He knows he can't make her love him, but he can't bear to lose her. Can he convince her to stay by his side as the clouds of war gather, or will circumstances beyond his control take her away from him forever?\nChapter One Williamsburg, Virginia April, 1774 Murder would have been a kinder fate, Claire thought, resisting the urge to chew on her lower lip. All of her plans had been made around an assumption that had proven to be overly optimistic. How could she have underestimated her uncle's spiteful nature? She sighed quietly. There was no point in chastising herself for shortsightedness. There'd be plenty of time for that after she found a way out of the ugly Byzantine maze her uncle had crafted. If only she'd managed to sleep some the night before. She needed a clear head, a mind that could wrest salvation from thin air. But she'd spent the night pacing her rented room, unable to think about anything except what a black-hearted scoundrel her uncle was. And now all she had to show for the effort was a brain that had all the power and clarity of lukewarm oatmeal. Claire clenched her teeth. \"I hope, Mistress Curran, that you found your lodgings suitable?\" Perched on the edge of the chair, Claire forced herself to swallow past the tightness in her throat, took as deep a breath as her stays permitted, and met the gaze of the man standing behind the desk. \"They're more than adequate for my needs, Mr. Cantrell. I appreciate your thoughtfulness and effort on my behalf.\" The solicitor lifted a sheaf of papers, perused them briefly, and then cast them down with a soft sigh. \"It's the least I can do under the circumstances. I'd like you to form at least a favorable first impression of Virginia hospitality. Devon isn't likely to be as concerned with the warmth of your welcome.\" Claire stared down at her lap. She didn't have to remove her worn kid gloves to know that her primly laced fingers had turned a ghostly white. Adjusting the drape of her dress and flexing the blood back to her fingertips, she said, \"I'm no happier with the circumstances than Mr. Rivard will be. If a way can be found to escape the situation, I assure you that I'll do so.\" Edmund Cantrell arched a pale brow and again picked up the sheaf of papers lying on the desk. \"He's not going to believe that you're an innocent party in this affair. You're aware of that, aren't you, Mistress Curran?\" She lifted her chin. \"I had no knowledge of either the nature or the contents of the letter before yesterday, and I'll swear such before God. You yourself broke the seal.\" \"Please,\" the young solicitor hurried to inject. \"I meant no dishonor to you. I know your uncle by reputation, and I'm quite sure that such perfidy is common to his business practices. It's Devon who concerns me. He has a streak of suspicion in him that's both wide and notorious. He won't be as . . .\" The man sighed and stared down at the papers as he shook his head. \"As what, Edmund?\" Claire pivoted in the chair, turning toward the office doorway and the direction from which the question had come. A man stood framed within it, the dark curls on his head only a scant distance from the top of the doorway, a mere sliver of space existing between his massive shoulders and the oaken sides of the jamb. The morning light stood at his back and cast his facial features into gray shadows. But she didn't have to see his face to guess the expression he wore. She could tell much about his state of mind by the broad stance he took in the doorway, by the way he commanded the room into which he faced. He was annoyed at having to be there, and he was determined to dispatch the business at hand as quickly as possible. She fixed her gaze on the desk before the affable Mr. Cantrell and fought back the wave of panic that threatened to propel her out of the chair, out of the office, down the street, and into blissful oblivion. A sense of pending doom settled over her shoulders even as she silently prayed, Please, dear God, let this be some other man. \"As what, Edmund?\" the stranger repeated, stepping across the threshold and stripping the woolen greatcoat from his shoulders. He turned toward the young man as though they were the only occupants of the room. \"Come now, I'm a busy man and I don't have the time for parlor games.\" Claire saw Edmund Cantrell rising to his full height and squaring his shoulders. \"I was about to say that you're not nearly as understanding as I am.\" Her heart sank with certainty. Devon Rivard made a soft, dismissive sound before replying, \"Hardly a great revelation, Edmund. Your message said it was a matter of great importance. Given the weather this morning, it had better be.\" \"And it is, I assure you,\" Cantrell responded, sweeping his hand in a wide gesture toward Claire. \"May I introduce Mistress Claire Curran, of London.\" For a quick moment Claire considered correcting the details of the introduction, to provide her former title and her proper place of residence, but then just as quickly decided against it. To be a lady trapped in a situation of obviously lower, trading-class origins . . . Besides, she admitted, the truth of what she was and where she came from wouldn't make a bit of difference in the larger, ugly scheme of things about to unfold. Without a word, Claire rose to her feet with a wholly feigned aplomb. The young attorney continued with the formalities, saying, \"Mistress Curran, may I present Mr. Devon Rivard, owner of Rosewind and one of the region's preeminent citizens.\" \"A compliment undeserved, I assure you,\" the newcomer said smoothly, turning toward her with the most abbreviated of bows. He was a rakishly handsome man with sooty eyelashes that framed eyes of darkest emerald, a mouth wide and full and somehow mocking, the corners etched with lines that seemed more faded than faint. Yet it was an intangible something about him that knotted a cord deep in the center of her chest. She named it fear and swallowed as best she could around the lump rising in her throat. His gaze skimmed the length of her, and she wondered if he knew that her secondhand sack dress was three years past fashionable and that she'd deepened the seams of the bodice to fit her meager attributes. With what little resolve she had remaining, Claire said, \"It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Rivard. I only wish that the circumstances were of a different nature.\" He lifted a dark brow while he offered her another brief bow. \"I can't consider unfortunate any circumstance which brings such an attractive young woman into my company, Mistress Curran.\" She thought the slight curve of one side of his mouth belied the compliment, and a flicker of ire coursed through her veins. The sudden warmth steadied her knees and strengthened her resolve. Claire dipped her chin ever so slightly in the direction of Edmund Cantrell, saying, \"I believe you'll shortly abandon any such thinking, sir.\" To her relief, the sandy-haired young man cleared his throat, lifted several pieces of parchment from his desktop, and began, \"Mistress Curran arrived in Williamsburg late yesterday afternoon bearing sealed correspondence from Mr. George Seaton-Smythe. You're acquainted with the gentleman, are you not, Devon?\" Claire watched the tall American stride across the office to toss his cloak over the back of an elegantly carved chair. She judged his height to be at least six and two. His boots were of soft black leather, rising to his knees and conforming to his calves. His frock coat was well tailored, the fit fashionably loose and covering the rest of him from her perusal. Not that she needed to see any more than she could. Everything about him spoke of a powerful man quite used to getting his way. Claire quickly moistened her lips and flexed her fingers at her sides. \"'Gentleman' is a term I'd use only loosely to describe Seaton-Smythe,\" Rivard replied, his back to her and his attorney. Folding his arms across his chest and fixing his gaze on something beyond the window glass, he added, \"I know him only by reputation. The productions of my estate are agented through another house.\" Her heart racing, Claire took a long, deep breath, stared at the carpet, and hoped that the attorney would make short work of the ugly business at hand. \"It appears that Wyndom doesn't share your assessment of the man,\" Edmund Cantrell continued. \"On the fourth day of January last he entered into a contract with--\" \"For what sum?\" Claire heard the steely edge of anger. The strength ebbed from her legs and she locked her knees before she could collapse into the chair behind her. \"Two thousand pounds sterling,\" answered the attorney, his voice soft in an apparent effort to ease the harshness of the truth. \"According to Seaton-Smythe, Wyndom has been either unwilling or unable to repay the debt.\" \"Tell me, Edmund . . . Did Seaton-Smythe have the gall to pretend that he ever expected my besotted brother to conduct himself honorably?\" Cantrell quietly cleared his throat and went on. \"Mr. Seaton-Smythe has offered three alternatives for correcting the unfortunate situation. As his first offer, he suggests that you permit him to legally attach your present and future consignments until the debt is paid in full. Should that be unacceptable, then he suggests that you pay the entire amount, in sterling. Mistress Curran is to act as the courier.\" Rivard broadened his stance and didn't look away from the window as he asked, \"And the third . . . alternative?\" Again Cantrell cleared his throat before he spoke. Claire closed her eyes as she listened to him reply, \"Mr. Seaton-Smythe has offered to cancel the debt upon delivery of legal proof of your marriage to his niece.\" Cantrell drew a long breath. \"The same Mistress Claire Curran.\" She heard the slow measure of Rivard's turn, felt the heat of his attention boring through her. Swallowing back the bitter taste of mortal embarrassment, Claire opened her eyes and met his gaze. Never in all her days had she seen such loathing, such unadulterated hatred in a man's eyes. She opened her mouth to speak, but couldn't make a sound. \"Mistress Curran wishes to find some manner of evading the proposal,\" the young attorney offered in hasty rescue. \"Oh?\" Rivard drawled, both dark brows slanting derisively. \"Do you have two thousand pounds sterling on your person, Mistress Curran?\" The cold mockery of his tone stole what precious little air remained in her lungs. She shook her head mutely. \"Have you, mistress, any property you'd be willing to forfeit for payment of my brother's debt?\" The sun-warmed stones of Crossbridge Manor shimmered bright before her mind's eye. But Uncle George holds the title. Her eyes aching from the threat of angry tears, Claire again shook her head. \"If I might be permitted to offer a possible solution?\" Edmund gently interceded. \"Seaton-Smythe has offered to cancel the debt upon the receipt of proof of your marriage. He made no stipulations regarding the nature of that union or the duration. Perhaps . . .\" \"A divorce?\" Rivard supplied, quirking one brow and smiling. \"An intriguing idea, Edmund.\" The young attorney stared blankly at the top of his desk and shook his head in slow disagreement. \"Intriguing, yes, but with attendant difficulties, Devon. As you well know, Virginia lacks the power to grant them, and so the case must be made in England itself. Additionally, acceptable grounds are very narrow and would cause the both of you permanent social scars. I was thinking of a slightly less scandalous way out of the marriage contract. One that we can manage in our own house, so to speak.\" \"An annulment?\" Claire heard herself ask in a stunned whisper. \"Are you suggesting that the marriage be annulled after my uncle has pardoned the debt?\" \"Not too terribly honorable, I know,\" Edmund replied. \"But it would be escape without complete social ruination.\" Devon Rivard's gaze swept her from head to hem, contempt shining in his eyes and twisting his lips into a cruel smile. \"And how quickly the lady thought of it.\" The sound of his scorn ignited fires she'd thought carefully and safely banked. The words escaped before she could stop them. \"How dare you, sir, cast aspersions on my character. You know nothing of me or my circumstances.\" She lifted her chin and appraised him in much the same manner as he had her only a moment before. \"I'd rather bed the Devil himself than consider marriage to such a self-consumed fool.\" He cocked a brow in slow consideration. Deep within his eyes a flame kindled. \"You speak of your circumstances,\" he said, his voice soft and yet somehow sharply cutting. She wouldn't explain anything to him. She'd go to Crossbridge Manor--somehow--and do what she could to sort out the disaster her life had become. Stepping around the chair, Claire took her cloak from the wall peg, saying as she did, \"I owe you no accounting, Mr. Rivard. And I'll give you none. Seek a solution to your dilemma as best you can, but don't expect me to be a party to it.\" She draped the woolen cloth over her shoulders and, while fastening the frog at the neck, added, \"I'll make arrangements to return to London as soon as possible. If you wish for me to bear your payment to my uncle, please see that it's delivered to my lodgings before I depart Williamsburg. Mr. Cantrell knows where to find me.\" She turned to find the attorney staring at her, his blue eyes large in his face. \"Mr. Cantrell,\" she said, dropping her chin in polite acknowledgment, \"I sincerely appreciate your kindness and--\" \"And how is it that you intend to pay for your passage back to London?\" Rivard asked, his tone no kinder than before. She turned to glare at him. His arms were once again crossed over his chest, but he had shifted his stance so that he rested his weight casually on one leg. The gaze that met hers was cool and distant. \"Perhaps you acquired some jewelry from the woman who gave you that god-awful gown?\" he ventured before she could reply. \"Might you be planning to sell a bit of it for your ship passage?\" His words struck her like a fist. Her throat tightened and she willed back the hot torrent of words. To speak would unleash angry tears and she would never give him that satisfaction. \"It doesn't matter on which side of the Atlantic you stand,\" he continued, both his tone and the light within his eyes hardening. \"George Seaton-Smythe has the reputation of a wharf rat. That you're of some blood relation to him counts against you. On the other hand, that you're obviously a poor and utterly disposable member of his family speaks in your behalf. He didn't send you here and offer you for sacrifice just to rid himself of an undowered, crumb-gobbling relative. What's his true intent?\" Excerpted from Come What May by Leslie LaFoy All rights reserved by the original copyright owners.

I wasn't actually your sister at Duke's Arms.\"\n\"You know what I mean.\" Her gave her an I'd-like-to-gag-your-mouth-with-a-used-handkerchief look.\nCatherine attempted to out stare him.\nMumbling something incoherent beneath his breath, he looked away. Her gaze then followed his to the bed, where more silken draperies hung from the big four-poster.\n\"Of course, I shall sleep on the floor,\" he said.\n\"Of course.\" She shrugged. \"It does look softer than most floors. And I shall insist you take the counterpane to fold into a little mattress.\"\n\"Will you be warm enough without it?\"\n\"Oh, yes. I shall have the bed curtains closed to hold in the warmth.\"\n\"I suppose they shall also give you privacy.\"\n\"True. I shouldn't like you to see me sleeping. I mean, what if my mouth gapes open like a moron\u2014meaning no disparagement to those poor afflicted souls.\"\n\"I cannot imagine you ever looking anything but ladylike.\"\n\"Oh, Airy, that is so kind of you.\" That he was incapable of staying angry with her, endeared him to her. The girl who would one day capture his heart would be very fortunate. Very fortunate, indeed.\nAs she directed a smile at him, his lashes lowered. She was certain his compliment now embarrassed him. He was not the smooth-talking, bed hopper she'd wager his twin brother was. She rather pitied the girl who married that twin. Reflecting over her own smooth-talking, bed-hopping late husband, she was now happy that he'd been possessed of those traits. Otherwise, his demise would have been too, too painful.\nShe sighed. Yes, the girl who married Mr. Steffington would be most fortunate.\n\"You must allow me to make your bed,\" she said. \"I am ever so experienced. Whenever my little nephews visit me in Bath, I make them a pallet on the floor of my bedchamber.\" She set about to remove the quilt from the bed, fold it lengthwise, and place it on the floor beside her own bed.\nThen her gaze traveled over him from head to toe. \"I fear you may be too tall.\"\n\"My feet won't mind hanging off.\"\nHe cracked a smile. \"Allow me to guess. You are now imagining my feet talking.\"\n\"You are possessed of the silliest sense of humor.\" He eyed the pallet. \"Perhaps you shouldn\u2019t put it so close to your bed. What if I snore?\"\n\"I am accustomed to men snoring.\" Her hand clapped around her mouth. \"I didn\u2019t mean to imply I've slept with multiple men. Only one, actually.\"\nHis dark eyes flashed with mirth.\n\"Why did you not warm to Lord Seacrest?\" she asked. \"I thought he was charming.\"\nMr. Steffington frowned. \"You would. He shamelessly flirted with a married woman!\"\n\"Well. . .I'm not actually a married woman.\"\nMr. Steffington's deep sense of morality touched her. She gave him a puzzled look. \"I hadn't noticed Lord Seacrest flirting. He was merely being friendly.\"\n\"Only to you. He was jealous of me.\"\n\"Why would he be jealous of you?\"\n\"Because I had the good fortune to marry you.\" He shrugged. \"At least, that's what the man thinks.\"\n\"Oh, Airy, that is so sweet that you think being married to me is a good thing.\"\nSeconds later, she feigned a yawn. \"I suppose I am rather tired.\"\nHis glance flicked to her valise, then to his beside it. He cleared his throat. She was coming to learn that he cleared his throat every time he was about to say something that he thought might be construed as too intimate. \"Would you like me to leave the room whilst you dress for bed?\" He was unable to meet her gaze.\n\"You don't have to leave the room.\"\nHis gaze absently lowered to her bodice, then whipped away. \"Then I vow to turn my back and close and my eyes whilst you . . . ah, remove your. . . well, you know.\"\n\"You don't have to close your eyes.\"\nThose dark eyes of his rounded. \"Oh, but I must. You're a lady, and I'm a gentleman.\"\nShe stood. \"That won't be necessary. I'll pull the curtains around my bed and then disrobe.\"\n\"Capital idea!\" He looked exceedingly relieved.\nShe went to her valise, removed her night shift, then crossed the room and climbed on top the big bed.\n\"Here,\" he said. \"I'll close the bed curtains for you.\" It was much easier for him because of his height.\nWhen he finished, she sat on that left side of the bed and listened to his footsteps move away. \"Thank you, Airy. Good night, sleep tight\u2014\"\n\"And don't let the bedbugs bite,\" he finished.\nOnce she had changed into her night shift and got beneath the covers she called out to him. \"I'm decent now, but I find I don't like the dark. If you weren't in the chamber with me, I would be terrified.\"\n\"Should you like for me to crack open your bed curtains?\"\n\"I, ah, shall need to restore my shirt first.\"\nHow she would love to see him without his shirt. \"Don't bother. I'll close my eyes.\"\nHe needn't know if she peeked. After all, it was quite dark within the cubicle of her bed. \"Certainly!\"\n\"Forgive me. I didn\u2019t mean to imply. . .\"\nHe quietly moved across the carpet. \"Where should you like the sliver of light?\"\n\"The foot of the bed will do nicely, thank you.\" And would afford a glimpse of him.\nSeconds later, a buttery vertical light striped the foot of her bed, and she stealthily watched as he moved back to his pallet with the powerful majesty of a panther. Firelight glanced along the tawny length of his long, lean, and wonderfully bare torso.\nYes, she thought to herself, her breath a bit ragged, the girl who snared dear Mr. Steffington would indeed be fortunate."

Cold fingers crept up Caro\u2019s spine. A premonition of what, exactly...?\nIt took a moment for the import of the lawyer\u2019s words to hit her.

Maybe...maybe he\u2019d loved her after all.\n\u2018No mistake,\u2019 the lawyer intoned.\nHer father had spent the last twenty years telling her it was her duty, her responsibility...her obligation to manage the charity he\u2019d created in homage to her mother.

Shulan City Police Department Security Division agent Li Jiazhe and Li Shining from the Qingfeng Township Police Station tortured Mr. Jiang for two days. The torture resulted in some broken ribs for Mr. Jiang and a perforated eardrum. Mr. Jiang was later sentenced to one year in a labor camp. Knowing his health condition, the labor camp refused to accept Mr. Jiang twice, yet the police sent Mr. Jiang to Yinmahe Forced Labor Camp in Jiutai County for the third time. That time, the labor camp accepted him against the regulations.\nA member of Mr. Jiang's family had visited him and also called him several days ago. They learned that Mr. Jiang's throat was so severely damaged that he could barely speak. The sound of his voice had completely changed. Division head Feng said, \"We were quite nice to him in the first week he was here.\" Mr. Jiang has been imprisoned for more than two weeks. It's apparent that Mr. Jiang was subjected to severe abuse during the second week. Mr. Jiang told his family that his \"environment\" was very bad. He lost so much weight that he now weighs less than 100 pounds.\nDivision head Feng told Mr. Jiang's family that Mr. Jiang refused to sign the five statements denouncing Falun Gong, and this affected his \"work performance.\" When asked how his work performance was affected, Feng said it was not appropriate to talk about it over the phone. Feng told Mr. Jiang's family that if he refuses to sign the statements, they would handle him according to the \"policy\" (Jiang Zemin's policies of \"destroy them physically, beating them to death is nothing and will be counted as suicide\").\nWhen Mr. Jiang's family told Feng that Mr. Jiang had heart disease, Feng said, \"If he has heart disease, it is normal if accidents happen.\" Mr. Jiang said his throat was injured because of the beatings the guards gave him under orders. A guard is rewarded with a 400 yuan bonus if he \"reforms\" a Falun Gong practitioner. The labor camp encourages the guards to commit crimes with the enticement of financial rewards."

                            "text": "Hey everyone! As you all know by now, the Pride and Prejudice read along is hosted by Misty of Book Rat as part of Jane In June. I have spent June either on vacation or incredibly busy during the in between, so I totally failed at responding to the response questions for parts three and four. Instead of dragging this into July, I picked my favorite questions from parts three, four and five and responded to those. I hope you all like them. If you haven't read Pride and Prejudice, I suggest you do. Maybe you could post a review on your blog during next Jane In June.\nDiscuss the whole of Lizzie's stay at Hunsford. There are many great, famous moments in this stay, as well as memorable characters. Discuss your highlights and low points (if any), your thoughts on characters like Lady Catherine and Col. Fitzwilliam, etc., as well as the new facets we see of the familiar characters.\nLizzie\u2019s stay at Hunsford is one of the most dramatic getaways one can imagine. I don\u2019t really have any least favorite parts, because this section has so many juicy moments. One of my all time favorite moments not only in this book but perhaps in all of literature is Lady Catherine\u2019s discussion of music.\nOf course, Lady Catherine. We all believe you have great potential. *rolls eyes* It\u2019s like Donald Trump saying he would be great president if he were to run. Also, Donald Trump and Lady Catherine both have very elaborate hairstyles. Lady Catherine is so absurd that I almost love her, but is actually nasty enough that really, I hate her. And I love to hate her.\nAs for our other characters, I like meeting Colonel Fitzwilliam. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that makes him particularly stand out among Austen men, but I do like him. Otherwise we learn that Charlotte Lucas is more observant than we give her credit for. Who knew?\nDiscuss Darcy's first proposal. Prompts: What are your feelings on this scene; what do you think of the behavior of both Darcy and Lizzie. Contrast this to Lizzie's first proposal from Collins. Is Lizzie's complete surprise believable, especially in light of Charlotte's prolonged insistence that Darcy feels something for Lizzie, and the slight hints Darcy drops prior to the proposal?\nIn terms of the fact that Darcy points out how poor Lizzy is, I would say that he is just as bad as Mr. Collins. Not cool, kids. Even though Mr. Darcy is a total fox, one can\u2019t help but be infuriated by his first proposal to Lizzy, considering that he talks about how beneath him she is, yet speaks with \u201cno doubt of a favourable answer\u201d (185). Ugh. At least Darcy, unlike Collins, does not threaten to continue asking Elizabeth until she says yes.\nWere I in Lizzy\u2019s shoes during Darcy\u2019s initial (and terrible) proposal, I think I\u2019d also be pretty surprised. Yes, Darcy has made a few flirtatious comments here and there. However, I feel like a lot of Darcy noticing and thinking about Elizabeth has been exposed not through dialogue, but through description. Plus, do I need to mention how rude Darcy was when he met Elizabeth?\nLizzie has to this point turned down two proposals. Share your thoughts on this from the perspective of the modern woman (presumably) you are, and from the perspective of a Regency gentlewoman. Consider the reactions of the people in her life, especially Mrs Bennet, if they were to find out. Also, consider her rejections from the males' perspectives. Is Darcy (or even Collins) justified in being shocked to be rejected?\nA woman living in 2011, I am 23 and have received zero marriage proposals thus far. I\u2019m not expecting to receive any soon. I don\u2019t remember precisely how old Lizzy is during Pride and Prejudice, but I believe she is between 20 and 23 (I seem to remember Lydia at one point mentioning that Jane is 23). I tend to think that a lot of people nowadays get married when they are somewhere between the ages of 25 and 30 (I know some people get married earlier, but I\u2019m making a guess here). Jane is considered something of an old maid. So really, for Lizzy to have two marriage proposals isn\u2019t all that surprising. If Mrs. Bennet were to find out that Lizzy had turned down Mr. Collins AND Mr. Darcy, I\u2019m pretty sure she would never speak to Lizzy again. I would say I think Mrs. Bennet would go so far as disown Lizzy, but I\u2019m not actually sure if she would have that kind of legal power.\nBelieve it or not, I actually think Mr. Collins and Mr. Darcy are both entitled to be shocked. First of all, Collins doesn\u2019t realize how ridiculous he is. Second of all, he is going to inherit Longbourn after Mr. Bennet dies. This means that should Collins so chose, he could kick all seven of the Bennets out, leaving them to try and find some other they can live with or be destitute. And who knows whose hands the estate will end up in after Collins? By the way, if you don\u2019t remember, not one of the Bennet girls is married at the time of Collins\u2019 proposal, so if Mr. Bennet were to die suddenly....well, you get the picture. I can\u2019t help but wonder if any of the Bennet girls consider Lizzy selfish for turning Collins down, even though they\u2019re probably also glad he didn\u2019t target them.\nMr. Darcy has ten thousand pounds of year, which is an absolute crapload of money in Regency England. While that doesn\u2019t entitle him to be a snob, some have argued that his inheritance plus his lineage have given him a certain right to be proud. Besides, who hasn\u2019t fantasized at one point or another about marrying someone insanely rich?\n-- Lizzie's first meeting with Darcy since the proposal.\n-- Darcy's behavior, and his apparent willingness to continue their acquaintance through things like proposing she meet his sister.\n-- The Gardiners' reactions to the whole thing.\nWhen you think about it, the visit to Pemberley is surprisingly not awkward. After all, the last time Lizzy saw Darcy, he was awkwardly giving her a letter trying to explain himself. So now we see Darcy trying to make amends for everything that has gone wrong, while Lizzy gets a much better glimpse of who Darcy really is. Plus she meets Georgiana, who is incredibly excited to finally make Lizzy\u2019s acquaintance. Lizzy is hesitant to believe Darcy could love her, and I would feel the same way. I think confusion is one of her primary reactions to the entire visit. Knowing how the book ends kind of makes me give a happy sigh every time I come across this visit.\nDiscuss Lady Catherine's visit to Longbourn, and Lizzie's showdown with her. Also discuss Mr Bennet's reaction to the rumors of Darcy's feelings for Lizzie, and then his reaction when they prove to be more than rumors.\nIf the fact that Lady Catherine went all the way to Longbourn just to make sure Lizzy isn\u2019t marrying Darcy doesn\u2019t prove that she\u2019s a snob, then I don\u2019t know what does. I think Lizzy holds her own quite well. As for Mr. Bennet\u2019s initial reaction, my heart hurts for Lizzy. I can\u2019t imagine how hard it would be to have her already crazy family deciding that they aren\u2019t sure about her marital choices. When he founds out that Lizzy and Darcy is engaged, I can\u2019t totally blame him for his reaction. It\u2019s not as though he knows what Darcy has done for Lydia and is legitimately concerned about Lizzy\u2019s happiness. I\u2019m always thrilled to see Lizzy in such a state of euphoria.\nDiscuss the way Darcy and Lizzie relate to each other at the end of the book, and Darcy's second (much superior) proposal. Also consider sharing your thoughts on what you expect for their future.\nDarcy\u2019s second proposal makes me cry every. Single. Time. A huge plot point in this novel is Darcy putting aside his pride and actually listening to Elizabeth. I think after seeing all of the drama unfold he understands her family\u2019s financial situation better. Plus, I think their opinions on the absurdity of Lady Catherine and Mrs. Bennet are similar.\nGive us your thoughts of the book on the whole. If you have read it before and/or read variations and sequels, what keeps you coming back? If this is your first time reading it, do you think you will read it again/read more Jane/read any variations or sequels? If you disliked it, don't be afraid to say so!\nWhat doesn\u2019t keep me back? I love Darcy. I love every character, even the ones I simply love to hate. The humor. The drama. The romance. Honestly, how much do I need to expound on these points to sufficiently convey my love for this book?"

I enjoyed your excerpt and the book was excellent. Thank you for taking time to share this enticing tidbit with me and my readers.\nThey paused at the base of the narrow, roughhewn servants\u2019 stairs. Slender rays of sun trickled from a distant window above, painting the confined space in wisps of light and shadow.\n\u201cAre you well?\u201d Fitzwilliam asked sotto voce.\nDarcy sniggered. How did Fitzwilliam joke of death so easily?\nDarcy grunted and shuffled his feet.\nMoans and coughs floated in the stale air. They turned toward the butler\u2019s rooms.\nDarcy bounced the back of his head against the cold stone wall.\n\u201cI will never understand your rarified notion of marriage. But if you insist upon it, you best act to secure your happiness quickly, or it may be forever lost to you.\u201d Fitzwilliam brushed past him and climbed the narrow stairs.\nDarcy sank down on the bottom step and drove his elbows into his knees. Bloody hell and damnation! Fitzwilliam was right.\nRetching and liquid noises raced through the narrow corridor. He might join the chorus himself very soon.\nNo woman had ever been so well suited for him or Pemberley. But she was so unsuitable, with nothing but herself to recommend her. Would it even be fair to her to expect her to manage a place like Pemberley? She knew nothing about estates or\u2014no, that was not true\u2014she cared for Rosings, above and below stairs, as much as any proper mistress. With her quick mind and active nature, she would certainly rise to any occasion.\nIf only he had kissed her. Then he might\u2014gah! He sounded like Fitzwilliam now. She had bewitched him utterly, mind and soul.\nLady Catherine de Bourgh is prepared to be very generous when it comes to medical care for her sickly daughter, Anne \u2013 generous enough to lure noted physician Dr. Thomas Bennet to give up his London practice and move his family to Rosings Park. But his good income comes with a price: complete dependence on his demanding patroness\u2019s every whim.\nNow the Bennet family is trapped, reliant on Lady Catherine for their survival. Their patroness controls every aspect of the Bennet household, from the shelves in the closet to the selection of suitors for the five Bennet daughters. Now she has chosen a husband for headstrong Elizabeth Bennet\u2013 Mr. George Wickham.\nBut Lady Catherine\u2019s nephew, Fitzwilliam Darcy, is not so sure about his aunt\u2019s choice. He is fascinated by the compassionate Elizabeth who seems to effortlessly understand everyone around her, including him. Lady Catherine has other plans for Darcy, though, and she forbids Elizabeth to even speak to him.\nAs Anne\u2019s health takes a turn for the worse, Darcy and Elizabeth are thrown together as Dr. Bennet struggles to save Anne\u2019s life. Darcy can no longer deny the truth \u2013 he is in love with Elizabeth Bennet. But Lady Catherine will do anything to stop Darcy from marrying her \u2013 even if it means Elizabeth will lose everything she loves.\nShe has one husband, two graduate degrees and two black belts, three sons, four undergraduate majors, five nieces, six more novels in draft form, waiting for editing, seven published novels, sewn eight Regency era costumes, shared her life with nine cats through the years and tries to run at least ten miles a week.\nThanks again for popping in, Maria Grace. I am sure my readers will be curious about the questions raised in your excerpt. Who is sick from laudanum? Why would Anne want Elizabeth for a companion? Who is this Anne anyway? Where is Mrs. Jenkinson going? What? Mr. Bennet a doctor? There are many questions that need to be answered. This dialog between the cousins is telling and offered some insight but still, the book must be read! Well done, Maria Grace.\nMaria Grace is offering an eBook of Mistaking Her Character to one lucky winner. The giveaway is international and you must 'have your share in the conversation' to be entered. Please leave your contact information in your comment so you may be informed if you are the randomly selected winner. Good luck in the giveaway. It will end at 11:59 PM on Thursday, 25 June, 2015.\nHe does seem to take his time, doesn't he Vesper!\nI LOVED this story. I LOVED this Darcy. He became such a hero in this book. Swoon!!!\nThanks, Monica. I felt that way about Mr. Bennet too!\nI've read several excerpts, and this story sounds great!\nJ Dawn King has made me like more the story with only one sentence on her comment \"e became such a hero in this book\"!\nI got to read a large portion of this as a serial and I was riveted. I look forward to getting the rest.\nAfter reading Maria Grace's information, I would say that she is an accomplished woman! Why is Mr. Bennett a doctor? Does he exert himself for his family, as he certainly does not in P&P, or does Elizabeth have to take charge? Oh, Darcy, help her.\nIn this variation, Mr. Bennet is a younger son and does not inherit Longbourn. So his profession is medicine. He is an excellent doctor, but not much of a father.\nLady Catherine will always try to persuade Darcy to became her son-in-law but he will always fall in love with Elizabeth so she will not win.\nIt is hard to have a P&P variation without Darcy falling for Elizabeth, isn't it?\nI have read this excerpt on another blog and loved it. Maria clearly knows how to write realistic characters that we all love though in very different circumstances than the original. I know how the story goes as I read it as a WIP on Jane Austen Variations but would love to win the e-book. Thanks for your generosity, Maria!\nI love this story. Wonderful excerpt. Thank you for the giveaway."

                            "text": "Fitzwilliam Darcy and Colonel Richard Fitzwilliam were roughly forced through the door of a small shack.\nThey had no clue as to their location and had presumed the men were taking them to the local jail, as it would be unusual for such accusations to be assumed and a sentence proclaimed without a trial. The men were certain they would be able to clear up the misunderstanding, as the Darcy and Fitzwilliam family names were highly respected all over England. As the colonel was buying horses for the military, the papers he carried would support their claim.\nDarcy wondered how his beloved was fairing. He had not sent her another letter, as he planned to arrive back at Bingley\u2019s leased estate within a few days. Then he would be able to spend time with his Elizabeth. Hopefully the issue before them would be resolved quickly, and the gentlemen could be on their way.\nEach step Darcy took was painful. He felt as if a hot poker was shoved into his leg as he walked.\nOnce inside the shed, the cousins realized it was being used as an office. Behind a large, highly polished desk, sat a man who was wearing an unusual uniform. When the man spoke, it was with a distinct accent.\n\u201cRees, what do we have here?\u201d the man behind the desk inquired of a man standing near the door.\nThe captain sat with his elbows on the arms of the chair in which he sat, with his fingers forming a steeple. Peering over his fingers, he took in the measure of the men standing before him.\nRees leaned towards the cousins, striking Fitzwilliam in the stomach with a club Rees had been holding. The colonel doubled over in pain.\nDarcy held out his hand.\n\u201cSILENCE!\u201d The captain stood up, motioning to his men.\nFitzwilliam finally had the strength to stand up straight.\n\u201cHe will need to wait until morning, as the apothecary is unavailable until then.\u201d Rees informed the pair as he shoved Fitzwilliam towards the office door.\nThe men walked towards a rundown building. There was a dim light visible through the filthy window near the door of the building. Rees pushed the door open, before motioning for the men to enter. Stepping inside, Darcy and Fitzwilliam discovered several other men, most lying on bunkbeds.\nWilliam Collins arrived on the doorstep of his distant cousin. Collins had grown up with his father telling tales of being treated badly by Mr Thomas Bennet, as the elder Collins was certain that his cousin had taken what was rightfully his, the estate of Longbourn.\nEvery year that went by without the Bennets having a son, Collins\u2019 father took great pleasure. He knew that the estate was entailed along the male members of the family. Without a son, the Bennet family would lose Longbourn to Collins. And Collins had a plan to further his revenge upon the family who had stolen what his father should have rightly had when he was alive. Collins planned to marry one of the Bennet daughters, thereby controlling her life, and the lives of her mother and sisters when Thomas Bennet was dead and buried.\nAnd he planned to teach them a lesson on what it meant to have crossed the Collins family.\nCollins was not the brightest of men, and he had struggled while he was in school. Later, after having taken orders, William Collins was given a position he could not have believed possible. Lady Catherine de Bourgh of Rosings Park, in Kent, gave him the living at Hunsford Parrish. To Collins, it was akin to be the parson of royalty. Every word she stated was if God spoke directly through her and the parson did everything she demanded.\nArriving at Longbourn was the first step to gaining his retribution for his father. Immediately, the parson began inspecting everything, the manor house, the park surrounding, the stables, and more. When he knocked on the door of the manor house, he counted how quickly the staff came to allow him entrance. And he even judged how Mrs Hill, the Bennet\u2019s housekeeper for over twenty years, appeared. Everything was lacking in Collins\u2019 opinion. Once he had been privileged enough to see Rosings Park, and the opulence of everything Lady Catherine touched, he could not wish for anything less for he\u2019s own life. Collins knew that one day, when he was master of his own estate, he would insist on everything being just like Rosings. As William Collins, master of Longbourn, he would feel near royalty himself.\nMrs Hill led Mr Collins down a hallway, knocking on a door near the rear of the house. Collins was not impressed with the interior of the home, it was lacking, just as the exterior had been. The voice of a man called from the other side of the door, beckoning them to enter.\nThe first impression of his cousin did nothing to improve Collins\u2019 opinion. He was determined to dislike all the Bennet family, and from what he had already seen, it would not be difficult.\n\u201cAh, Mr Collins. It is a pleasure to meet you, cousin.\u201d Thomas Bennet stated as he stood from behind his desk.\n\u201cCousin. So, this is Longbourn.\u201d The parson said with an obvious disgust in his tone.\n\u201cYou have five daughters, do you not?\u201d Collins inquired.\nSuch news did not sit well with Collins\u2019 plans. How could he revenge his father\u2019s pain if the family was not beholding to him?\nThe men were rudely awakened with the sunrise.\nFitzwilliam, having lived with being in the military for many years, was up and ready in no time. He then turned his attention to his cousin. Darcy was having difficulty, grimacing as he lightly touched his leg.\n\u201cAnd he was all out of parchment to give you a proper bill of sale.\u201d A second man stated.\n\u201cWe will see that changes are made, once we return to England.\u201d Darcy stated.\n\u201cYou will never leave this place.\u201d Liam stated.\nMost of the men looked down at the ground, muttering their agreement. Darcy and Fitzwilliam glanced around at the men, witnessing the submission they were demonstrating for the captain and his men.\nTwo other men stepped on each side of Fitzwilliam, taking hold of the man\u2019s arms, and led him to the wagon. They assisted both Fitzwilliam and Darcy up on the wagon, then climbed aboard themselves. As the wheels began turning, Darcy leaned closer to his cousin.\n\u201cIs this all you are to receive in a day? My horse eats better than this.\u201d Fitzwilliam was disgusted.\nElizabeth stomped across the field to the north of her father\u2019s house, towards the estate of Netherfield Park. Her sister had been invited, the day before, to take tea with the sisters of her betrothed, as his second sister, Caroline Bingley had arrived. Jane had become drenched in a sudden and unexpected rain storm. Longbourn received a missive from Mr Bingley that his betrothed had taken a chill, and he was insistent that she remain at her future home until she was completely well.\nWishing to escape from her mother\u2019s presence, Elizabeth determined to visit her sister and see to her needs. While she walked, the day\u2019s events surfaced in her mind.\nWilliam Collins had proven himself to be a fool and heartless. His preening over his patroness was revolting, especially after all Elizabeth had been told of Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and it was her ladyship\u2019s own nephew who had informed her.\nAs Elizabeth reached for the missive, her cousin spoke.\n\u201cWhen Lizzy and Mr Darcy are married. They are to wed in a double wedding with Jane and Mr Bingley.\u201d Kitty answered.\n\u201cMrs Bennet, please control yourself. Mr Darcy will return and he will marry our Lizzy. I have no doubt as to his love of our daughter. Mr Darcy shall return in plenty time for the wedding.\u201d Mr Bennet declared.\nWith that, Elizabeth left the room, and found herself outside the house. She needed Jane to reassure her. And Mr Bingley would know if his closest friend was leading her into folly."

                            "text": "Lady Catherine knew that there was only one way she could foil the plans of her nephew to marry Elizabeth Bennet, and he was currently in her bedchamber, waiting for Lady Catherine to return. They had spoken earlier in the day of the possibility of having to eliminate the young lady, but how to do so without anyone realizing what had truly happened? How could they see to the young lady\u2019s demise, yet not make it appear to be murder? The pair would discuss it in more detail after she returned from dining with her nephew.\nThe passageway was cold and dark. The footman had made his way through the area, he was able to navigate the dark areas with ease. But this time was different, he was leading Lady Catherine, and she was stumbling frequently. Fortunately, the lady kept her words quiet, as they came as mumbles that were hardly audible. As they neared the stretch that would lead directly to the room in which Elizabeth Bennet was sleeping, the footman turned to his employer.\nKnowing he had no one to blame but himself, for choosing the life he had and lowering himself to bed such a disgusting woman, he also knew there were far worst ways to earn the funds he desired. His mother wished to purchase the inn at which she had worked for years, and he would make sure that his mother was able to achieve her goal. All of his life, the young man knew his mother sacrificed and worked hard to give him a good life. It was his turn to do whatever he could to provide for her.\nThe pair continued towards the secret door, and once there, the footman carefully opened the door into the dressing chamber. Lady Catherine was impressed with the passageway, which few seemed to know existed, and wondered if there were such passageways at Rosings.\nThey moved further inside the apartment, until Lady Catherine took her place at the foot of the bed, so she could watch her servant rid her life of the young lady who had entrapped her nephew.\nAs the footman reached over to take hold of one of the pillows, a hand came out of the darkness and grabbed hold of the footman\u2019s, stilling his progression. The hand came from under the coverlet, yet it was too large and too strong to have belonged to Elizabeth Bennet.\nThe sound of a match striking was heard from across the room, and the lit match was used to light a candle near the main door of the bedchamber. In the light, the face of Thomas Bennet was illuminated.\nAs Mr Bennet came into view, the coverlet was moved, to reveal Fitzwilliam Darcy, who had been hidden in the bedding, beside Elizabeth Bennet. The men knew something was going to happen, and they were ready to catch the deadly pair in the act, so there would be no difficulties in bringing justice.\nDarcy removed himself from the bed, leaving Elizabeth, who was wide awake, against the pillows that would have been used to snuff out her life, if Lady Catherine had had her way.\n\u201cI knew you would try something, Aunt Catherine. That is why Mr Bennet and I stayed in this room. We decided to be here, to catch you in the act. You would have continued your attacks if we had moved Elizabeth to another room, so we needed to witness your attempt to harm my betrothed.\u201d The word rolled off his tongue sweetly. Betrothed. A small smile bubbled to the surface.\n\u201cI wished to see this chit, who has made you forget what you owe your family. This is the first I have seen of her.\u201d Lady Catherine attempted to justify her presence.\n\u201cI had nothing to do with any murders, it was this man who committed them. I did not tell him to do anything, it is all his doing.\u201d Lady Catherine pointed her finger at her footman.\n\u201cYou ingrate\u2026\u201d Lady Catherine growled, as she lunged at him, her hands reaching for his throat.\nJerome turned and reached out his hands, in an attempt to reach hers, only to have Darcy step between the two of them, while Mr Bennet came up from behind Lady Catherine.\n\u201cYou are harming me, and I am not going to tolerate it any longer.\u201d She claimed, lifting her foot and attempting to kick Mr Bennet in the shins.\n\u201cDarcy, perhaps it would be best if you took hold of your aunt. I doubt that Mr Bittle will be any problem, as it is in his best interest to behave himself. If he does, I will speak on his behalf.\u201d Mr Bennet stated for all to hear.\n\u201cTraitor\u2026murderer\u2026turncoat\u2026it is all your fault that we were caught. If you had done the job properly, it would have been over days ago and I would not have had to come here. You foolish man, you have ruined everything.\u201d Lady Catherine cried out in anger.\nElizabeth had reached over and pulled the tassel, which was connected to a bell in the servants\u2019 dining room. Unknown to Lady Catherine and her servant, Mr Phillips, Mr Bingley, and Sir William were in the servants\u2019 dining room, waiting for the signal. As Darcy took hold of his aunt, the other three men entered the room.\nHaving never heard such anger in her nephew\u2019s voice, Lady Catherine became quiet and calm. She knew it would be dangerous to provoke her nephew, as he was much like his father. And when Gerald Darcy had been severely angered, it was wise to steer clear of him.\nDarcy stepped closer to the window, looking out at the dark covering the land. He could not speak, his anger was so great that he could not say all that he felt. It was difficult for him to control himself when he was so emotional. His father had taught him that it was better to distance himself, focus on other aspects, than to unleash the fury on others, no matter how much they deserved to be thrashed. He had no desire for Elizabeth to witness his darker side.\nBingley nodded his head, and he led Lady Catherine from the room, with Mr Phillips following. Sir William and Mr Bennet moved closer to Jerome.\n\u201cIf you would allow me, I would like to write to me mum. It would ease her mind if it came from me. You can read the letter, I will not write against any of you.\u201d Jerome said. He knew that his best odds of having any sort of life would be to do as the men told him. All Lady Catherine could now offer him for his loyalty was death at the end of a rope.\n\u201cIt is to protect her and her family from the scandal that would come if there were a trial. Mr Bennet and Sir William are willing to have you transported, I am certain the men will agree with me on this.\u201d Darcy said, turning his head to view the two men. Mr Bennet nodded his head, seeing the wisdom of Darcy\u2019s words.\n\u201cThen you will write to your mother and a date will be fixed for your departure.\u201d Darcy stated.\nMr Bennet and Sir William led Jerome from the room, leaving Elizabeth and Darcy alone, though the door was standing open.\n\u201cThen it is a good thing that Mr Darcy is to be your husband.\u201d Jane replied.\n\u201cMy goodness, Jane, I believe that is the most unkind thing I have ever heard you say.\u201d Elizabeth stated. She was growing fatigued from their discussion.\nA smile grew on Elizabeth\u2019s lips. \u201cYes, I wish to be at my best when he arrives.\u201d Elizabeth soon drifted off to sleep.\nOver the following days, the Bennets had remained at Netherfield, as Mr Bennet wished to ensure his continued participation in decisions being made, not to mention, he wished to make certain that Elizabeth was on the mend before she was moved.\nIt was expected to take at least a week before word would arrive from Matlock. Therefore, all were shocked to find Lord Matlock arriving at Netherfield two days after a message had been sent to him.\n\u201cUncle, I thought you were in Derbyshire. How did you come so quickly? We just sent a rider with a message two days ago.\u201d Darcy inquired, shaking the hand of his mother\u2019s brother.\nLater that day, the door was unlocked and opened to the room being occupied by Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Her brother, Lord Matlock, Henry Fitzwilliam, entered the room.\n\u201cCatherine, sit down. We need to speak.\u201d Lord Matlock said, attempting to keep his voice neutral.\n\u201cHenry Albert Fitzwilliam, our father would be ashamed of your behavior. I am your sister, the first born child in our family. I deserve being treated with respect. Our father would be turning over in his grave to see you behaving so horribly to me. Allowing our nephew to ruin our family, you should be ashamed.\u201d Lady Catherine was stamping her walking stick against the ground as she spoke, attempting to prove her point with each strike.\nThe physician arrived, and the decision was made. Since Lady Catherine showed no signs of repenting her actions, and there was fear that she would cause harm to others, she would be placed, involuntarily, in an asylum that was located in Kent. It would be close enough for Anne to visit her mother, if she wished. Though it was a painful decision for Lord Matlock to make, he knew that the health and safety of his entire family was at stake, and he was the head of the family.\nWhile the plans were being made for Lady Catherine\u2019s journey to the asylum, Darcy was spending as much time with his betrothed. The couple had determined to marry the following week, with a common license from the parson at Longbourn. Elizabeth was growing stronger each day, and, by the time Lord Matlock prepared to leave with his sister, Elizabeth was able to spend some time each day in her sitting room.\nAt first, Elizabeth was concerned for her appearance. Her bruising was beginning to fade, appearing in shades of green and yellow as it was healing. The swelling was completely faded before the wedding, and Darcy insisted that he did not care what gown she wore, as he knew he would not even notice, once he looked into her eyes. This caused Elizabeth to blush deeply.\nA longing came over Elizabeth\u2019s expression. It would be her first holiday season without her family, alone with this man, in Town. How was she to make such a drastic change in her life?\nThe Bennet family had returned to Longbourn a few days before the wedding of Elizabeth and Mr Darcy. After dining one evening, Mr Bennet remembered he had left his book in his bedchambers. He walked up the stairs to retrieve the book, then returned to his study.\nAs he entered the door of his study, he was shocked at the sight before him. Mrs Bennet was sitting on the sofa, a book in her hand, reading. Beside her was Kitty, and she too had a book in hand, her attention completely consumed by the words. Lydia was lying on her stomach on the floor, in a most unladylike manner, with a novel held in her hands. The youngest Bennet was giggling at something she had just read.\n\u201cPlease, Papa, might we remain here to read. Mamma will not allow me to be on the floor in the drawing room. She says it is unladylike.\u201d Lydia added.\nMr Bennet was not pleased with the invasion of his privacy, but he sat down, behind his desk, and opened his book. Soon, he forgot about his wife and daughters, losing himself in his own world. Over the days to come, it would be common to find the family spending their evenings in such a manner, with Mary and Jane joining.\nThe morning of Elizabeth\u2019s wedding to Fitzwilliam Darcy began with a light snowfall. Not a terrible storm, as the one they had been forced to endure, but a dusting of powdery snow to make the world fresh and clean. Elizabeth smiled, feeling the world was telling her that the day would begin new and fresh, just as the pure snow that sparkled in the sunlight.\nMrs Bennet was in a state of nerves, wishing to make certain that the wedding preparations were all they could be, with the constraints on the amount of time she had to prepare. She felt they should wait for at least four or five months, so a wedding fit for a man of Darcy\u2019s station could be held. The dear woman could not understand that her soon to be son was not fond of the glamor of the ton.\nThe couple insisted on a simple wedding, with only family and a few close friends. The wedding breakfast would also be simple, nothing elaborate, much to Mrs Bennet\u2019s chagrin. Then the couple would be off to Town.\nThe Bennets would follow to London on the Monday prior to Christmas. They would remain in Town for a fortnight, spending some of the time with Mrs Bennet\u2019s brother and his family. Mr and Mrs Gardiner had always been fond of Elizabeth, and looked forward to knowing her new husband. After the new year had begun, Mrs Bennet would finally be blessed in planning the wedding she wished for her daughters, as Jane Bennet had become engaged to Charles Bingley. As both Jane and her intended were amiable, they agreed to allow Mrs Bennet free reign on the wedding preparations. Elizabeth was pleased with her sister\u2019s betrothal, as she knew how much Jane loved Bingley.\nWhen Mr Bennet entered the chapel with his most beloved daughter on his arm, leading her to the man whose heart now belonged to her, Mr Darcy was true to his word. If anyone had inquired as to the color of her gown or the adornments in her hair, Darcy would have been unable to inform them. For when his eyes met hers, he saw nothing else. The sparkle and life that he found there warmed his heart, making him feel complete. He finally came to understand his parents\u2019 marriage, and the emptiness with which his father had struggled after his mother died. Darcy prayed he would never know the pain his father suffered, as he wished to spend eternity with his beloved Elizabeth.\nThe vows were exchanged, and soon enough, Darcy was staring into the eyes of the new Mistress of Pemberley and Darcy House. Mrs Elizabeth Darcy. He could not imagine a better sounding name for her.\nAfter spending as little time as possible at the breakfast, the couple made their excuses to leave. Jane and Elizabeth embraced, both having tears streaming from their eyes.\n\u201cYou will be staying with us when in Town, will you not? There is no reason for you to remain at Hurst\u2019s townhouse alone.\u201d Darcy knew his friend had sent his sister to visit relations in the north, and had no plans to accept Caroline in his home in the future.\n\u201cI would be pleased, Darcy. I am not certain when Louisa and Hurst will return, as they planned to visit Hurst\u2019s family at their estate. So I would have been alone in that big house.\u201d Bingley smiled.\nDarcy and Elizabeth were soon on their way to London, and to the beginning of their life together. They found comfort in each other, in a way they had never known before.\nWhen they arrived in Town, it was late afternoon. The butler opened the door for his Master and new Mistress.\nElizabeth could see the affection the elder housekeeper held for the Master. It pleased her to see that the staff cared for her husband.\nSeeing the joy in their master\u2019s expression brought pleasure to the longtime servants. They had long feared the sort of lady that would become the next Mrs Darcy, especially when they saw such young ladies as Miss Bingley attempting to capture Darcy for a husband.\n\u201cA bath would be delightful, Mrs Jefferson. And I am certain that the refreshments will be appreciated, as my husband and I had a difficult time concentrating on the food my mother served this morning.\u201d Elizabeth admitted. \u201cI must admit, I feel comfortable already in Darcy House. It is not at all what I expected. The furnishings are much like my husband, refined and elegant, yet comfortable and sturdy.\u201d Elizabeth\u2019s cheeks suddenly reddened when she realized that her words could be misconstrued.\nThe couple spent their first week alone at Darcy House, with only a few servants seeing them outside of their rooms. Elizabeth was pleased to learn that the man she married was the kindest and best of men, and that his love for her was true.\nAH, such a sweet ending. Lady Catherine and Jerome\u2026the image of him servicing her is just ghastly. Darcy was truly merciful in sending him and his mother to America. The fact that he has murdered\u2026more than once\u2026makes me wonder if he will reform as there is no one in America to watch over that. Hopefully if/when his mother learns of all he did she will keep a watchful eye on him. Lady Catwitch\u2026Purgatory might seem like heaven in comparison to the conditions in an asylum and if she is housed with the general population who are as mad as she and she begins to spout her insanities she might find herself being straggled.\nGreat Story! Thank you oh so much.\nI really enjoyed this story. I hoped that Lady Cat understands what she tried to do was wrong. Anne will be so much better without her running things. Darcy and Lizzie together will always be the greatest love story ever."

                            "text": "In this lesson, we'll go over the quintessential romantic comedy, Pride and Prejudice. We'll take a look at all of the factors conspiring to keep Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy apart as well as read some of Jane Austen's sparkling prose.\nPick a movie: How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, Bridget Jones' Diary, Knocked Up, When Harry Met Sally. In all of these, it starts out rough then ends up being a wonderful union at the end. It's also not a coincidence that almost every Jane Austen novel has been made into a movie because we've got a way of thinking about that kind of plot now in movies; it's a sure box office winner. But Jane Austen was way more talented than your average Hollywood screenwriter. She kind of invented this plot; she invented the 'people don't like each other and then they fall in love' story.\nShe, actually, originally titled the book First Impressions, but she was forced to change it when she published it. This is interesting to know because it's kind of a handy way of remembering what Elizabeth and Darcy think of each other. The new title is Pride and Prejudice; the original title was First Impressions. Their 'first impressions' of each other are that Darcy is way too 'proud', and Elizabeth thinks he's too proud and is 'prejudiced' against liking him on further interaction.\nJane Austen is known for her dry wit and sparkling dialogue, and this is arguably one of her most famous lines, so you should probably know it. It's also an interesting line because you get the sense that Jane Austen, herself, doesn't really believe that it's true (it definitely wouldn't be 'universal,' so that tips us off). But her characters do, so she's inhabiting their voice right off the bat in the opening of the book. This is something that's called free indirect discourse because she's expressing the thoughts and words of her characters, but she's not directly signaling it. So, she's not saying he said, she thought or they believed (which would be the most applicable in this situation). She uses this all the time in the book, but it's really prominent in this opening sentence. It's also a famous opening sentence!\nSo, everyone in the neighborhood is freaking out because this rich guy has moved in nearby to this place called Netherfield Hall. The Bennets are freaking out times five because they have five daughters who all might want to marry this guy.\nLuckily for them, Mr. Bingley actually likes one of their daughters, Jane, who's the oldest one. She's really pretty, and she's really nice, so it kind of makes sense that he would like her. They end up hanging out and dancing a lot at this neighborhood ball, which they seem to have a lot of in this book.\nBingley has brought along with him his even richer friend, Mr. Darcy, and he tries to set him up with Elizabeth at this same ball. Darcy's kind of a tool at first. So, Bingley's like, 'You should hook up with Elizabeth,' and Darcy's like, 'No. She's kind of ugly. I don't like her.' Elizabeth overhears this and is justifiably upset; thinks he's kind of a jerk. She's not a big fan. But like in all romantic comedies, they begin to grow on each other. Darcy, eventually, acknowledges that Elizabeth is pretty and that she's actually really smart and fun to be around. Elizabeth learns that, while maybe Darcy isn't the most socially gifted guy in the world, he's actually really nice and decent. And he also has a lot of money. From this set up, it seems like the sister-sister, friend-friend double wedding thing is going to happen, and it's going be great.\nThere are, actually, a lot of people in the book who do not want this to happen and are actively (and inactively) trying to stop it. We're going to go over some of those people now; they're kind of the main antagonists in this book.\nFirst of all, we have Bingley's sisters, who like Jane because she's really pretty and likeable. There's really nothing not to like about her, except that she doesn't come from money. Bingley's sisters really want him to settle down with someone of much higher social status. They've picked out Mr. Darcy's younger sister, Georgiana. She's 16, so that's a little ehh, but that's how they rolled back then. Bingley's single sister, Caroline, really wants this to happen. She's awful; she's like the worst person ever. She has the hots for Darcy, so she wants her brother to marry his sister, so she can have a better chance with him. That seems to make sense to her; it doesn't really make sense to me but whatever. We'll just go with it. So, Bingley's sisters don't want him to marry Jane, and they have someone else picked out for Darcy.\nThe next person who does not want this to happen: Lady Catherine de Bourgh. She's Darcy's aunt, and she's kind of old and cranky and nasty, and she's awful. She wants Darcy to marry her daughter (who's his cousin; again, things were kind of weird back then) to keep their family fortunes all together. She's super rich, but she's horribly ostentatious, and her house is really tacky.\nAnother person who is getting in the way of Elizabeth's marriage is Mr. Collins. Mr. Collins is Mr. Bennet's cousin, and he's actually the rightful heir to the estate (remember the entail prevents the daughters from inheriting it). He actually proposes to Elizabeth, sort of as a gesture of 'We'll keep this in the family.' But he's super annoying and weird, and she denies his proposal. She still isn't into Darcy, but she's like 'No. I don't want to marry you.' He actually ends up marrying her best friend, so it works out okay for him in the end. So, those are the people who are actively trying to mess things up.\nThe rest of the Bennet family inactively messes things up. They don't have a lot of money, so people don't want their sons to marry into their family. But they're also kind of terrible and embarrassing - all of them. Mr. Bennet's okay; he sort of stays out of things. He's nice, but he doesn't really take action. Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth and Jane's mom, is obnoxious, a hypochondriac; she's really embarrassing and doesn't realize it. Mary is their middle daughter. She's just a boring know-it-all. She's always trying to show off with these 'accomplishments', like she plays the piano really badly. Kitty, another sister, is all right but kind of boring; you forget about her. Lydia is a huge problem. She's the youngest; she's 15. She ends up eloping with a soldier and bringing all kinds of shame on the family. They're already not such a good family and she does this, which isn't so good.\nDespite all of these things, Elizabeth and Darcy do end up falling in love with each other.\nShe starts to think, by seeing his house, that Darcy might actually not be a proud, rich tool but maybe someone who's kind of nice with bad social skills to deal with. Then he helps her family sort out the whole Lydia-marrying-the-soldier mess and that wins him points in Elizabeth's book. They all end up happily ever after in the end.\nThat's basically what happens. To run through it real quick: In the end, the Bennets are happy. They are avoiding ruin that the entail might have brought because their daughters did marry well. Bingley's sisters are kind of upset because Bingley married Jane, and Darcy didn't marry Caroline; he married Elizabeth. Lady Catherine is really upset because she thinks the Bennets are awful and bring disgrace. Maybe they do, but who cares what she thinks. Most importantly, Elizabeth and Jane are happy - partially because they're married to great men and also because they don't have to hang out with their awful family anymore. They're also rich, so that's a plus. That's Pride and Prejudice in a nutshell!"

He walks them home and Elizabeth introduces him to her parents.\nSince she's interested in Wickham, Elizabeth believes everything he says. An introduction to her parents is significant: it sets the stage for courtship.\nA letter from Caroline Bingley arrives for Jane, who reads it in distress. Upstairs, Jane shares the contents of the letter with Elizabeth. Everyone at Netherfield has left for London, not to return for at least six months, if ever. Caroline ends the letter by saying that she will be delighted to see Georgiana Darcy again, who she hopes will become Bingley's wife. Jane is despondent and refuses to believe that, as Elizabeth explains, Caroline is trying to break her and Bingley up while also gaining better footing with Darcy for herself. Elizabeth does manage to convince Jane that she shouldn't doubt Bingley's affections.\nElizabeth can read between the lines to discern what's really going on. Caroline wants to prevent Jane from going any further with her brother because she does not want her own family associated with the Bennets for two reasons: she disdains them; and she believes that by marrying her brother to Georgiana she will improve her own chances with Georgiana's brother, Darcy.\nFyfe, Paul. \"Pride and Prejudice Chapter 21.\" LitCharts.

Mr Bingley is soon well-received, while his friend Mr Darcy makes a less favourable first impression by appearing proud and condescending. When Elizabeth Bennet overhears herself slighted by Mr Darcy, she forms a prejudice against him. Mr Bingley singles out Elizabeth's elder sister, Jane, for particular attention and it soon becomes apparent that they have formed an attachment to one another.\nOn paying a visit to Mr Bingley's sister, Jane is caught in a heavy downpour, catches cold and is forced to stay at Netherfield for several days. Elizabeth arrives to nurse her sister and is thrown into frequent company with Mr Darcy who begins to perceive his attachment to her.\nJane Austen (16 December 1775 \u2013 18 July 1817) was an English novelist whose works of romantic fiction, set among the landed gentry, earned her a place as one of the most widely read writers in English literature, her realism and biting social commentary cementing her historical importance among scholars and critics.\nFrom 1811 until 1816, with the release of Sense and Sensibility (1811), Pride and Prejudice (1813), Mansfield Park (1814) and Emma (1816), she achieved success as a published writer. She wrote two additional novels, Northanger Abbey and Persuasion, both published posthumously in 1818, and began a third, which was eventually titled Sanditon, but died before completing it."

                            "text": "Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice follows Elizabeth Bennet, a spirited and clever young woman, as she and her sisters navigate romantic and social entanglements within 19th-century England's country gentry.\nThe novel opens with Mrs. Bennet informing her husband that the nearby great house, Netherfield Park, has a new tenant: Mr. Bingley, a wealthy and unmarried young man. Mrs. Bennet is convinced that Mr. Bingley will fall in love with one of her daughters\u2014preferably Jane, the eldest and by all accounts the kindest and most beautiful. Mr. Bennet reveals that he has already paid his respects to Mr. Bingley and that they all shall meet soon.\nAt a neighborhood ball, Mr. Bingley makes his first appearance, along with his two sisters\u2014the married Mrs. Hurst and the unmarried Caroline\u2014and his best friend, Mr. Darcy. While Darcy\u2019s wealth makes him the subject of much gossip at the gathering, his brusque, arrogant manner quickly sours the whole company on him.\nMr. Bingley shares a mutual and immediate attraction with Jane. Mr. Darcy, on the other hand, is not so impressed. He dismisses Jane's younger sister Elizabeth as not pretty enough for him, which Elizabeth overhears. Although she laughs about it with her friend Charlotte Lucas, Elizabeth is wounded by the comment.\nMr. Bingley's sisters invite Jane to visit them at Netherfield. Thanks to the machinations of Mrs. Bennet, Jane gets stuck there after journeying through a rainstorm and becomes ill. The Bingleys insist upon her staying until she is well, so Elizabeth goes to Netherfield to tend to Jane.\nDuring their stay, Mr. Darcy begins to develop a romantic interest in Elizabeth (much to his own annoyance), but Caroline Bingley is interested in Darcy for herself. Caroline is particularly irritated that the object of Darcy's interest is Elizabeth, who doesn\u2019t have equal wealth or social status. Caroline endeavors to eliminate Darcy's interest in Elizabeth by speaking negatively about her. By the time the girls return home, Elizabeth\u2019s dislike for both Caroline and Darcy has only grown.\nMr. Collins, an obsequious pastor and distant relative, comes to visit the Bennets. Despite not being a close relation, Mr. Collins is the designated heir of the Bennet's estate, as the Bennets have no sons. Mr. Collins informs the Bennets that he hopes to \u201cmake amends\u201d by marrying one of the daughters. Nudged by Mrs. Bennet, who is certain that Jane will soon be engaged, he sets his sights on Elizabeth. Elizabeth, however, has other ideas: namely George Wickham, a dashing militiaman who claims that Mr. Darcy cheated him out of a parsonage he had been promised by Darcy\u2019s father.\nAlthough Elizabeth dances with Darcy at the Netherfield ball, her loathing is unchanged. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy and Caroline Bingley convince Mr. Bingley that Jane does not return his affections and encourage him to leave for London. Mr. Collins proposes to a horrified Elizabeth, who rejects him. On the rebound, Mr. Collins proposes to Elizabeth's friend Charlotte. Charlotte, who is worried about getting older and becoming a burden on her parents, accepts the proposal.\nThe following spring, Elizabeth goes to visit the Collinses at Charlotte\u2019s request. Mr. Collins brags about the patronage of the nearby great lady, Lady Catherine de Bourgh\u2014who also happens to be Mr. Darcy\u2019s aunt. Lady Catherine invites their group to her estate, Rosings, for dinner, where Elizabeth is shocked to find Mr. Darcy and his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam. Elizabeth\u2019s unwillingness to answer Lady Catherine\u2019s prying questions does not make a good impression, but Elizabeth learns two important pieces of imformation: Lady Catherine intends to make a match between her sickly daughter Anne and her nephew Darcy, and Darcy has mentioned saving a friend from an ill-advised match\u2014that is, Bingley and Jane.\nMuch to Elizabeth's shock and fury, Darcy proposes to her. During the proposal, he cites all the obstacles\u2014namely, Elizabeth's inferior status and family\u2014that his love has overcome. Elizabeth refuses him and accuses him of ruining both Jane\u2019s happiness and Wickham\u2019s livelihood.\nThe following day, Darcy gives Elizabeth a letter containing his side of the story. The letter explains that he genuinely believed Jane to be less in love with Bingley than he was with her (though her family and status did play a role, he admits apologetically). More importantly, Darcy reveals the truth of his family\u2019s history with Wickham. Wickham was a favorite of Darcy\u2019s father, who left him a \u201cliving\u201d (a church posting on an estate) in his will. Instead of accepting the inheritance, Wickham insisted that Darcy pay him the value in money, spent it all, came back for more, and, when Darcy refused, tried to seduce Georgiana, Darcy\u2019s teenage sister. These discoveries shake Elizabeth, and she realizes that her prized powers of observation and judgment did not prove correct.\nMonths later, Elizabeth\u2019s aunt and uncle, the Gardiners, offer to bring her along on a trip. They end up touring Pemberley, Mr. Darcy's home, but are assured that he is away from home by the housekeeper, who has nothing but praise for him. Darcy makes an appearance, and despite the awkwardness of the encounter, he is kind to Elizabeth and the Gardiners. He invites Elizabeth to meet his sister, who is excited to meet her.\nTheir pleasant encounters are short-lived, as Elizabeth receives news that her sister Lydia has eloped with Mr. Wickham. She hurries home, and Mr. Gardiner tries to assist Mr. Bennet in tracking the couple down. News soon arrives that they have been found and are to be married. Everyone assumes that Mr. Gardiner paid Wickham off to marry Lydia instead of abandoning her. When Lydia returns home, however, she lets slip that Mr. Darcy was at the wedding. Mrs. Gardiner later writes to Elizabeth and reveals that it was Mr. Darcy who paid off Wickham and made the match.\nMr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy return to Netherfield and pay a call on the Bennets. At first, they are awkward and leave quickly, but then return almost immediately, and Bingley proposes to Jane. The Bennets receive another unexpected visitor in the middle of the night: Lady Catherine, who has heard a rumor that Elizabeth is engaged to Darcy and demands to hear that it is not true and never will be true. Insulted, Elizabeth refuses to acquiesce, and Lady Catherine leaves in a huff.\nRather than stopping the match, Lady Catherine\u2019s escapade has the opposite effect. Darcy takes Elizabeth's refusal to acquiesce as a sign that she might have changed her mind about his proposal. He proposes again, and this time Elizabeth accepts as they discuss the mistakes that finally got them to this point. Mr. Darcy asks Mr. Bennet\u2019s permission for the marriage, and Mr. Bennet gives it willingly once Elizabeth reveals to him the truth of Darcy\u2019s involvement with Lydia\u2019s marriage and of her own changed feelings for him."

Avoid drama and hurt feelings by teaching your child how to respect others.\nUgly rumors, whispered secrets, and embarrassing comments start to spread like wildfire at school among 8- and 9-year-olds. \u201cKids this age use gossip to experiment with how much power and influence they have over others,\u201d explains Karin S. Frey, Ph.D., research associate professor of educational psychology at the University of Washington in Seattle. \u201cThey also do it in an attempt to be more popular.\u201d Fortunately, you can help your child ditch the drama with this guide to the grapevine.\nYour child may think that if what he says is true \u2014 and not merely his opinion or a rumor \u2014 that it\u2019s not gossip, says Parents advisor Eileen Kennedy-Moore, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist in Princeton, New Jersey, and author of The Unwritten Rules of Friendship. Chatting about a child who failed a test, reporting who got sent to the principal\u2019s office, talking about who still needs help from the teacher tying her sneakers \u2014 kids may not see anything wrong with sharing these types of tidbits. But, of course, that\u2019s not the case. While it\u2019s unrealistic for your child never to mention something about a classmate who isn\u2019t present, you can teach him about what topics are off-limits. Go over what issues could be sensitive (like divorce and other family situations), embarrassing (such as a bad grade, a crush, or getting sick in school), or misconstrued (saying a student was in the principal\u2019s office may lead others to believe he\u2019s in trouble) so that he knows to avoid discussing them.\nAlso give your child advice about when he should alert the teacher about what he\u2019s heard. \u201cTell him that it\u2019s not tattling if someone could get hurt physically or emotionally by the gossip or if it involves doing something wrong, such as cheating on a test,\u201d says Dr. Kennedy-Moore. And if your child feels embarrassed about filling in the teacher, you can drop her a note yourself to let her know what\u2019s going on."

The rumor mill has an irresistible allure. It is a point not lost on those seeking attention. Shrewd celebrities have managed to parlay fortunes from misfortunes.\nThe vicarious enjoyment that comes from \u201cthe grapevine\u201d manages to entice even those indifferent to it. It is difficult to turn away when gossip rears its interesting head. While it can be fun speculation on who slept with at red carpet event, it is not so thrilling when you are the subject.\nWhen we talk about a movie stars, there is a distance involved. They are far removed from the talk. But, when the subject is your next door neighbor, the gossip can do irreparable damage. Loose talk can decimate marriages, fracture friendships and compromise co-workers. The revelation of a confidence cuts like a knife. Once a comment is made, either true or fictional, just an accusation can sound like verified truth.\nThe problem with gossip is that sometimes critical parts of the story are missing. If you do not know one critical detail, what looks like an affair could be something very different.\nRumor: Married Man Out with a Younger Woman?\nTake for example a handsome married man going to lunch with an attractive blonde much younger than he. They are having fun, laughing and enjoying the day. They smile, and kiss. On the surface this sounds like a man having a hot and heavy affair. Anyone witnessing these two is bound to think the worst. However, there is one critical piece of information missing. The young blonde in question is the married man\u2019s daughter from a previous marriage who moved away and has not been seen in a while. Miss that one detail and now you have a wife in tears ready to call a divorce lawyer.\nRumor: Recovering Alcoholic- Off the Wagon?\nHow about the recovering alcoholic girlfriend? She has been sober for ten years. Then one day her supportive boyfriend sees empty beer cans in her car. What may not be known is that the girlfriend was taking the cans to recycle center for a friend whose car was in the shop. Sounds far-fetched? Not so much. These things happen.\nAs a psychic advisor, I have seen so many situations that sound horrific only to learn that the gossip mill is incomplete and sometime inaccurate. People do talk, but sometimes there is a real hidden agenda. The co-worker who smiles and covers for you maybe out to undermine your success. That same friend could be making themselves look good relating the real reasons you had to find someone to cover your shift was because you had a hangover. You are demoted and your friend promoted.\nInnocent gossip and speculation about the rich and famous is one thing. Manipulative half-truths and outright lies are another. Before you believe anything, ask some questions and be open to another version of the events described. Truth really is stranger than fiction."

One of the lesser fun news releases is that Anna Paquin\u2019s (\u2018True Blood\u2018) Rogue was cut from the film and over the weekend a rumor came out that another major female mutant had also been blown out of the picture. Like wildfire the Internet was ablaze with a rumor that Halle Berry\u2019s (\u2018Cloud Atlas\u2018,\u2019Extant\u2019) Storm had also been almost completely taken out of the film!\nWhile many might have been disappointed with Berry\u2019s performance and the direction of her character in the 2006 release of \u2018X-Men: The Last Stand\u2019, if they were going to be cutting most of her work from \u2018Days of Future Past\u2019 it is highly doubtful that they wouldn\u2019t be \u201ctelling her until the movie comes out.\u201d That kind of a sesnsationalist claim really looks more like something mentioned to get clicks on an article than anything else. So moving past that, it looks like thankfully, for Berry, gossip is just that as Super Hero Hype has spoken to a \u2018trusty source\u2019 and says there is no truth to the original post\u2019s claim and she\u2019ll be doing some cool stuff in the film. Let\u2019s be honest. That sounds more realistic.\nWhether this is spin control or truth, we won\u2019t really know for certain until the final product is on the big screen.\nWhat do you think about the rumor of Storm being mostly cut from the film? Would you be OK with a little less of Halle or should the weather witch be front and center? Which do you think is the one to believe?

                            "text": "A HOT summer evening in Ohio. My young daughters, barefoot and dressed in light nightgowns, press against the screen door. Lavender twilight veils the front lawn. Katie, aged 5, asks to go outside. I hesitate; it is an hour past their bedtime. They are bare-legged and freshly bathed. I am about to shake my head and start them to bed when my wife speaks up, ``The fireflies,'' she says, ``are about to come out.'' Before I know it, we have stepped outside to the porch and begun to peer into the dusk. From across the grass, at the base of the oak tree, the first light quietly winks. Katie and her two-year-old sister, Emily, stare, transfixed.\nNeither has seen a firefly before. We are in Ohio only briefly, visiting my wife's grandparents. Back in our New Mexico home, the arid night sky is equally as empty of lightning bugs as biting bugs.\nSuddenly Katie, her short hair bobbing, bounds down the steps onto the lawn followed by a wide-eyed Emily. I start to murmur to my wife, ``Don't you think it's too late...,'' when it dawns on me to be quiet. I walk down the porch steps and stretch out on the grass.\nBy now dozens of fireflies have appeared, punctuating the twilight with pricks of phosphorescence. Katie darts after several at the end of the lawn, while Emily, more single-minded, pursues a solitary flash of light near the calla lilies. As I watch, I feel concern shifting from daughters to lightning bugs, particularly one venturing within the orbit of my two-year-old's grasp.\nBut my worry is misplaced. Emily intuitively senses its fragility. She approaches patiently, her right arm extended, not catching the firefly so much as letting it catch her. Slowly it alights on her index finger, and an expression of awe and delight breaks across her face. To someone unfamiliar with fireflies, a first appearance is no less astonishing than a unicorn's. Her arm outstretched, she ferries the blinking creature across the lawn and holds it before my eyes. Together we watch it reconnoiter her finger, illumine the skin dazzlingly in yellow light, then lift its wings to sail into the dark.\nMy wife's grandparents, having followed the scene through the living room window, now have stepped outside on the porch, bringing with them a small glass jar. They pass it to Katie with the gentle admonition to trap lightning bugs, but briefly. Before long, the jar harbors a dozen crawling denizens, their bursts of light briskly irradiating the glass container. Katie and Emily gaze down into the glow, their faces as incandescent as the two girls' in John Singer Sargent's ``Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose,'' caught on canvas as they peered into paper lanterns during summer twilight.\nI turn from daughters to great-grandparents, silent and smiling, on the porch, the pleasure in their faces animated more by two-legged than winged creatures. Now they watch as Katie turns the lid and opens the sparkling jar to the night air. They have lived here since their birth; they've seen 90 Ohio summers come and go, and this one will be their last because they are moving to another state to live closer to my wife's parents; their house has already been sold.\nSuddenly I realize that, had we stayed inside, my daughters would have missed forever encountering fireflies here. I'm struck by how nearly I deprived them of this evening of awakening wonder. And how nearly I deprived myself: I can't imagine anyone recalling more vividly the exhilaration on the faces of those on the grass and on the porch. Distant generations linked by a midsummer-night's awe.\nThe evening will join the mind's collection of incidents from years past; those experiences too strong to be extinguished which we each carry with us. Images of places and seasons, to be sure. And not least, of faces of family, flickering like fireflies in the dusk of memory."

There is no reason that you can\u2019t wear your favorite scent year round. As an aromatherapist, I truly believe that on dreary cold days, a light citrus scent with notes such as bergamot and grapefruit can provide that much needed lift in mood. A tropical scent can also help to bring warm thoughts. On the other hand, an exotic woody scent on glowing summer skin is extremely sensual and very appropriate. I actually wear Noche Del Fuego, from my collection, year round \u2013 I love the blend of sandalwood, vanilla and honey spiked with paprika, saffron and black pepper.\nLayering is a great way to transition if you\u2019re not ready to give up your \u201cwinter\u201d scent. Try layering with a floral, green or citrus. Go lightly on both to give a unique twist to your favorite.\nWhat should you look for in a summer scent?\nIt\u2019s important to test the fragrance on your skin first. Scents can smell a little different in warm, humid weather. Also, when your skin is warm and moist, scents have a tendency to render a stronger veil. Try to let you favorite aspects of summer help guide your choice, whether it\u2019s the smell of new flowers blooming, fresh cut grass, the sea or the early morning air. Have fun with your choice; fragrances shouldn\u2019t be taken too seriously.\nPlease describe your process when developing a 'summery' scent?\nI love to create my fragrances starting with natural oils. I envision the warm earth bearing beautiful new life \u2013 colorful summer flowers, green leaves on the trees, birds singing and blue skies. I use oils that remind me of these things. I continue to pull and drop by drop add and reduce until I cannot stop smelling it the art that I have created. With all of Spadaro Fragrances, I anchor them with a base that has some warmth like patchouli or musk. It\u2019s a nice way to complete the experience."

And with the sunsets we've seen this summer, we've certainly found that to be true. Each sunset is unique - some are a grand finale as the sky erupts with color, others are a gentle fade of purples and oranges as the sun floats down below the horizon. Either way, we've never seen a sunset that we regretted watching. There's only so many summer sunsets left this year, so to make sure that you soak them all in, we're calling out all of our favorite spots to watch the show.\nMaybe we're biased with this one, but Deer Lake's proximity can't be beat. On property just steps from the Beach House, Deer Lake's sunset shows are some of the most grand in the area. The simplicity of a single dock and a hilly tree line across this tiny lake turns into a silhouette backdrop for a tremendous display each night. Bonus points if you take in this view from a paddle board or kayak, available for rent at the beach.\nOur neighbor to the north, Petoskey is a city on a hill with front row seats facing the sunset's stage. There are lots of places in town that overlook Little Traverse Bay, but there's no better vantage point for the sun's last hurrah of the day than at the pier. Garnished with a classic lighthouse, Petoskey's Pierhead is the quintessential sunset spotting location.\nA small lake with a lot of personality, Walloon Lake is a hidden gem off the beaten path. Where Ernest Hemingway spent his boyhood summers, the sunsets as viewed from the shores of Walloon Lake are without a doubt, the source of inspiration behind many of Hemingway's classics. We can't help but feel inspired, either, when that sun drops below the horizon and the warm glow shone by the sun has a similar effect in our hearts.\nIf you want a clear line of sight between you and the sun's grand exit, Petoskey State Park's beach is the place for you. Home to some prime hammocking spots, this state park also features camping, hiking, beaching, and all your favorite summer activities - including sunset spotting.\nOverlooking downtown Boyne City and Lake Charlevoix, Avalanche Preserve rests at the top of 476 steps. If those don't get your heart rate up, the view will. The topography surrounding the lake is illuminated at sunset, as the lake becomes a reflecting pool and the sky becomes the playground for the sun's last light to create spectacular displays.\nOn an after-dinner stroll through downtown Boyne City or from a hammock in Veteran Memorial Park, the day's grand finale is extra grand when viewed at the marina in Boyne City. The bridge on Lake Street and the adjacent grassy park make this sunset spot convenient, yet magnificent. The silhouette of sail boats and fishermen add detail to the classic pinks, oranges, and purples that light up the sky.\nJust like everything else at The Inn, sunsets here are top notch. Bay Harbor's position is ideal for year-round sunset viewing, but the summer sunsets are our favorites. Here, you can se the sun glow its way from beautiful orb to tiny sliver of light, all the while casting color and reflections into the big lake under a big sky."

                            "text": "In this lesson, we take a look at painting a landscape with pastels that features a sunset. Following a sequential approach, the background is developed first before moving on to the middle ground and foreground. Multiple layers of colors are added to develop strong contrast and to heighten the illusion of light.\nAs is the case with any image that features strong light, our focus centers around color and value contrast. Silhouetted elements in the middle ground and foreground enhance the lighter tones in the sky. Blues, purples, and oranges provide color contrast and the strengthen the illusion of light in the background - the \"star of the show\".\nOne of the more appealing aspects of pastels is the immediate gratification of applying colors. There is no mixing of colors prior to application and colors can be quickly adjusted once they are on the surface.\nAlthough we benefit from this characteristic, it's important to note that pastels are at their best when they are layered. Often it requires many layered applications to build up the color to level of complexity. This requires the artist to be patient as the painting develops, gradually adjusting as each layer is applied.\nSome beginners make the mistake of ending the layering process far too early, discouraged by the look of the subject while in transition. It's important to work through and continue layering applications until the desired color and value is achieved. Many pastel papers are textured with a coarse tooth in order to accept many layers of color, so don't be afraid to build up colors as necessary.\nPastels can be applied with opaque applications, not unlike what we see with oils or acrylics. For this reason, we can make applications over the top of previous applications, covering them completely.\nThis allows us to develop a landscape sequentially. The background can be developed completely before addressing the middle ground and lastly, the foreground. In this case, we can start at the top of the paper and work our way downward, layering applications as we go.\nWe start here with a base application of Ultramarine and bits of orange and yellow in the lower portion of the sky. PanPastels are used initially to cover the surface quickly. Over the top, a variety of blues are applied with pastel and blended with a finger. Darker blues are applied at the top of the sky transitioning to lighter blues at the bottom. A bit of light cream is applied at the bottom extreme to lighten the value even further.\nLayered applications of orange, yellow, and light cream follow in the area of strongest light. In the lower portion of the sky, colors are gently blended with a finger by pulling them horizontally.\nWith initial colors of the sky in place, our focus turns to developing the clouds and the light that they reflect. Beginning with a medium purple, the shapes of the clouds are defined and lightly blended with a finger. A bright orange is used to create highlights and a light purple is applied to ease transitions. A bit of blue is applied to add a bit of depth and complexity to the lower right cloud.\nThe light source is important in any work. In many circumstances, the light originates from above, producing highlights on the top of subjects and shadows underneath them. With a sunset, the light source is a bit more complex. Instead of originating from above, the light often originates from the horizon. This produces highlights on the underside of clouds and shadows on the upper portions.\nThe \"Pastel Landscape Mastery\" video course is a comprehensive learning experience designed to provide the student with the most comprehensive approach to drawing landscapes with pastels.\nWe continue to patiently build up applications of light purples, blues, and oranges. Darker grays are applied in shadowed areas of the larger clouds to darken the value and strengthen the value contrast. Applications are gently blended with a finger to ease transitions and to smooth the texture. Detailed areas are blended with a blending stump for added control.\nThe light is intensified by additional applications of orange, yellow, and light cream. A few strokes of light cream are applied to indicate a few breaks within the cloud.\nSince the work is largely about the sky, we'll limit the amount of space devoted to the middle ground and foreground. By placing the horizon in the lower portion of the picture plane, we make certain that the sky remains the main focus.\nDark Umber is applied and blended to define the horizon and ground plain. A few marks are added to indicate distant trees, before touches of light and dark yellow-green are applied with a pastel pencil. Purples and pinks are added with horizontal strokes, creating a field of flowers.\nStronger marks are applied for flowers closer to the viewer with the same purples and pinks. A white pastel pencil is used to lighten values closest to the light source.\nUsing a light touch with a black pastel pencil, the trunk and branches of the tree are defined. Small circular strokes are applied for the leaves over the outer edges of each branch. Light yellow-green is used to add a bit of color, softening the strength of the black.\nAdditional strong applications of orange are added to the bottom of the clouds to complete the image."

                            "text": "I recently read about a woman in India who was bored with her life. After fifty-five years of marriage, she was tired of the same ole same old, so she began hormone revitalization, had invitro fertilization and gave birth to a baby girl at the age of seventy.\nYou can bet trading in prune juice smoothies for apple juice sippy cups jacked her excitement level up a notch or two.\nOur daily grind can sure seem dull. You get up in the morning, throw back a cup of caffeine, and launch into the same routine day after boring day: work, cook, clean up, repeat. Seriously, isn\u2019t life made up of 90 percent routine? All of it so easy to overlook as Papa God\u2019s intentional blessing.\nYes, I said blessing. As in no catastrophe is currently occurring, your health allows you to get up at all, and Papa God has generously allowed you to live to see another sunrise. These are blessings we often take for granted.\nGratitude for the mundane keeps our Creator-creation perspective intact. It\u2019s the acute awareness that the Source of our everyday blessings \u2013 such as a warm breeze, lungs to draw it in, senses to feel its pleasure \u2013 is here with us every second, enjoying our enjoyment.\nWhen we look at it this way, the mundane becomes downright thrilling! We see annoyingly noisy kids as happy, carefree children; work duties become a privilege many are without; household chores wouldn\u2019t take so long if we lived in a grass hut swarmed by flies.\nSure, routine can be boring at times, but we really don\u2019t want to resort to extreme measures like the Vermont mother who thought hanging onto the cargo rack of her car with her five-year-old son while traveling fifty miles per hour would add a little zip to her day. Now she\u2019s zippy in jail.\nLook for the laugh: Peel away a few layers to see humor in everyday situations.\nPlan getaway-cations: Save your pennies for a special trip to a special place. But in the meantime, plan monthly, restorative, low-cost mini-vacays for long weekends. Anticipation is half the fun.\nGet your bad self down: Add more music to your life\u2019s soundtrack. Whether you\u2019re listening to it or making it, music lightens, brightens, and heightens your spirit.\nGet dirty: Yahweh created dirt. He likes the stuff. He designed plants to live there and human skin so that it washes right off after we work the soil. So create a sweet-scented garden, even if it\u2019s only a few pots circling a concrete light pole. It will calm you, beautify your living space, and connect you with the Master Gardener.\nSister, we can\u2019t let thankfulness be a casualty of boredom. Let\u2019s choose to feel blessed, rather than entitled, in our marvelous everyday mundane. Maybe an injection of gratitude is just what the Great Physician ordered.\nAbout the author: Debora M.

She was beyond excited she felt like she was going to explode.\nNobody else had made her feel that much emotion for the past four years.\nShe always had some suspicion about Emily dying out of nowhere - that wasn't the Emily that she knew. To Tina, if Emily was going to get killed by someone - it would be her, it wouldn't be just anyone.\n\"Tina,\" Mark whispered Tina's name from behind her.\n\"Shh,\" Tina raised her forefinger and put it to her lips to silence Mark, \"Be quiet,\" she said with a serious look on her face.\nMark looked towards the direction where Tina was focused. He frowned when he saw a woman that looked like Emily.\n'Is that Emily? Isn't she dead?' Mark thought to himself.\nMark had always abhorred Emily's face because Tina was obsessed with her. Tina could never stop talking about Emily especially over the past four years. She also had plastic surgery so she would look like Emily.\nEmily was just a plain old girl - Mark didn't know why Tina was so obsessed with her.\nIf he hadn't known that Tina, in reality, hated Emily so much that she wanted to kill Emily with her own two hands, he would've thought she was in love with Emily.\nEither way, Mark hated anyone who caught Tina's attention - whether it was a guy or a girl.\nEmily stared Mark down - he was her brother who had attempted to kill her over and over again.\nTo Emily, Mark wasn't a brother anymore, he was an evil spirit with no conscience.\nEveryone was coming together in one place and there was nothing that could be done about it. This should have been over four years ago!\nTina put on a sly smile, picked up her dress, and started to walk towards Emily only to be held back by Mark.\n\"Let me go,\" Tina barked as she turned around to scowl at Mark, \"Didn't you hear me, Mark? Let me go.\"\nagainst his - that meant she was real!\nEverything was too surreal for Jacob. Emily was here. She was real. The void in his heart had been filled once again.\nEmily! His Emily! Alive Emily!\nThe kiss sent Emily into a trance that when she finally realized what was happening, she instantly pushed him away, \"Get off!\"\n\"Sss...\" Emily didn't know that she touched his wound on the chest which made Jacob take a deep breath.\nEmily was shocked, \"What happened to you?\"\n\"Just an accident,\" Jacob said, nuzzling his face into her hair, \"Come here, I want to hold you again.\"\nTears were welling up in Emily's eyes and her heart was still beating rapidly, \"Are you hurt?\"\nNo wonder she hadn't saw him for several days. Emily didn't know what she felt for Jacob but she knew that she couldn't blame him nor hate him because he hadn't done anything wrong.\nOn the contrary, Emily felt like apologizing to him.\nBut she couldn't pretend that everything was fine and everything was back to normal.\nShe didn't want to be stuck in the past.\nJacob noticed the change in her eyes and suddenly, he felt okay for the first time in four years.\n\"I lied to you, it wasn't an accident,\" he said, smiling and leaning towards her to kiss her again. But Emily slapped him across the face before he could even get close."

                            "text": "August's Type Foundry of the month is Emily Lime, a fairly new, one-woman type foundry started by Emily Conners and based in Greenville, SC. Emily is a self-taught type designer who primarily creates script-y fonts due to her passion and enjoyment of calligraphy.\nEmily worked in technology for many years, putting in 70+ hours a week which led her to do some soul searching and find a career she was really passionate about. While working in technology sales, she was able to pick up a few graphic design skills and found herself building on those skills, falling in love with typography and learning as much as she could in her free time. As her love for design and type flourished, she decided to create and release some fonts, and she soon became a best seller on several font vendor sites.\nAll images below are courtesy of MyFonts.com. Thanks for sharing!\nI first encountered Carolyna Pro Black when I worked as an intern at a stationery design company in Knoxville, TN. Here at Papercut, we have a project in the works utilizing Carolyna Pro Black. This whimsical and informal font is versatile in that it works on the web, can be used for logos and is also popular on printed items such as stationery. It stands well on its own and also pairs nicely with more rigid, serif fonts.\nI enjoy the carefree and spontaneous strokes that make it friendly and inviting. It reminds me of receiving a decorative hand-written note from a friend, and it gives designs a nice personal feel. Carolyna, its sister font, is a similar option in a lighter weight. Both come with a high number of glyph and swash options, so you can really have fun with the details of how the letterforms fit together.\nBombshell Pro is another script font from Emily Lime that has become very popular. Like Carolyna, it also resembles realistic, informal calligraphy. It\u2019s great for headings because of its \"run-on\" letter connections. It also comes with roman numerals.\nBergamot is an interesting contrast to the calligraphy-inspired fonts. It still has a casual and informal hand-written quality, but it\u2019s actually inspired by more formal serif and headliner fonts. It has a playful twist that I could see pairing nicely with some fun illustrations or being used to create a more relaxed feel.\nLarou is quirky, curly, and fun. It is less elegant than Carolyna, and because the letters are not uniformly sized, it is unexpected and can lend a fun energy to layouts.\nI think Emily Lime is interesting because it is yet another example of how the Internet is changing the way we design and find fonts. People of diverse backgrounds have the ability to educate themselves on design and independently develop their passion. This can only benefit the professional world of design because it is like adding more spices to our spice rack!\nI want to be a font!\nI LOVE these fonts! Larou is especially great\u2014while less elegant, it feels so alive!"

Moments that you stumble across and it feels like taking that first perfect bite of cake, savoring it on your tongue before finally having to swallow it down and lose the pleasure of it in your mouth to the process of mundane digestion. In dark days, those moments are a lifeline. In happy times, days fill up with so many of them, that it's easy to take them for granted. I shared many \"perfect moments\" with Aunt Mattie and they sustained me through a broken childhood, and shattered dreams. They often kept my fears at bay and reminded me that there is always a light in the dark, if you know where to look.\nWhile writing this blog article, I sat on my deck enjoying the comfort of having nature all around me. I need the outdoors, especially with difficult topics, because it helps soothe things that hurt. While remembering various \"perfect Mattie moments\", tears of longing streaming down my face, I looked up. Playing right next to me was a black butterfly with indigo-tipped blue wings, fluttering carefree in the bushes beside me. \"I am here,\" I could almost hear her whispering. \"Alive...In the breeze that's teasing your hair and on the leaves...in the flowers you scent on the wind and the tingling bells of chimes dancing through time and space and the Universe. I am the blue of the sky above, the sway of the trees, and the call of birdsong.\" Try as I might, I cannot suspend the moments I wish to capture, nor call them back once they have passed...except in my memories and on a clean sheet of paper, with words that will never do justice to the feel of the actual moment, itself. It is enough, however, to remember and be ever mindful of when new moments will come...and they will come!\n*Images @ carolinanature.com (butterfly) & girlichef.com (chocolate cake)."

Grandmother stood on the balcony, wind yanking at her straggling silver hair and fiery eyes looking out, beyond the horizon. Her black dress and laced hat wrinkled slightly in the breeze, echoing the lines on her haggard face.\nHe had been spent. He\u2019d had a wonderful life, looking at him was like looking in a mirror.\nGrandmother looked down at the curved metal railing, and at the taut skin on her claw-like hands.\n\"Perhaps that was why I loved him so much.\"\nHer voice cracked as she spoke, a million and one thoughts croaking out in that one sentence, a million and one regrets. She remembered herself.\nA tall young woman, caramel hair soft and flowing, down over her shoulders and flicking up and out at her hips, like a silken waterfall. Her nose lay dainty and perfect in her face, and her flaming golden eyes stood proudly out in her sparkling china skin. She wore green dresses, knee-length and fluttering as she walked with her head held high, proudly showing herself to the world.\nGrandmother shocked herself when her heels turned her around, back to face the door of the balcony. Her bedroom was beyond it, and inside her bedroom, a patterned curtain draped over something. In the corner, just a curtain. The curtain was thick, flowery patterns wearing away over time, yet the sheet had been untouched for years.\nGrandmother found herself in her bedroom. She faced the curtain.\nLike a mantra, she repeated it again. Her skin felt rough and tired, loose and frail to the touch of anyone but herself. She held her own hand and all she felt was warmth and softness. She always has been the young woman, sprightly and free, and ever so beautiful. And she always will be.\nBut she caught up. A breeze came in through the open door and her heart thumped itself along in its tired way. She heard the warmth leak out of her body and seep into the world around her. As she breathed in, she struggled for air - the air she did get tasted stale and overused.\nThe mirror hid under the curtain, begging for light.\nIn 40 years she had not once seen her own reflection. In 40 years she was still the most beautiful young woman in the world. She had not changed in 40 years - she wasn\u2019t sure whether she had managed to convince herself of it yet. If she thought she was young and beautiful, would she not be?\nHer son was her own reflection. He was like her, and his passing at 25 left him preserved forever in his beauty.\nShe loved him, for she loved herself.\n\"I am beautiful.\" She said, and tore away the curtain.\nWanted to give Grandmother *****. The page moved before I could mark each star. I'm sorry."

A tear trickled down from the corner of her eye, slowly running down the creases of her skin and into her ear. She smiled wryly at the warm sensation. She relished every sensation her aging body still had, even tears.\nSunlight spilled through semi-closed curtains, muted by the veils of voile that hung from the rail. Dust motes danced in the summer breeze drifting through the high open window.\nThe sound of birdsong took her back to days gone by, of days when the sun shone, days when she flirted, and teased, and lived \u2018til twilight fell and stars glittered in the sky.\nEven the subdued rays teasing her window reminded of nights beneath moonlight, nights of passion, nights of love, and nights embraced in warm arms.\nThose days, and nights, were long gone, and so were the people who\u2019d inhabited them with her.\nNow, she reclined in solitude upon crisp white sheets, soft pillows, and surrounded by the fragrance of orange blossom from the vase upon her night stand. No one visited any longer except nurses, who were dutiful, and friendly, and engaging, but none were family, none mattered beyond the essentials.\nTime was waning and Alys was fine with that.\nShe listened to the whispering breeze curling around the mock orange outside, lifting the scent to join the foliage in her room. Beneath her dry, closed eyelids her eyes itched, and her nose whistled as she breathed. A limp curl of snow-white hair fell across her brow and tickled her furrowed forehead. Her throat rattled, and despite the nurses\u2019 regular attention, her parched mouth gasped.\nAlys placed a frail hand on her chest, gently stroking the lace beneath her fingers, then letting her palm rest still. Her heartbeat pulsed, slowly, steadily \u2013 like the rhythm of an evening cricket\u2019s chirrup. She knew the time had come.\nShe pulled lightly at the ribbons holding her nightgown closed, and they slid away from the bow the night nurse had made. Alys drew her nightgown open and exposed her chest. Pale, papery skin threaded with lilac, purple, and blue veins sat across bones that protruded beneath their fragile shroud. Alys reached down towards her heart, feeling gently along her delicate, cool flesh, until her fingers stopped at warm metal.\nA weary smile curved her lips, and her fingers smoothed over the bronze metal plate that sat over her heart. She lifted a thin tab and withdrew a small key. The key was intricate, ornate, and truly beautiful, and she held it between her fingers with true reverence and gratitude.\nNot everyone had a key, but due to heart failure decades ago, when young children still sat on her lap, she\u2019d been fitted with a bio-mechanical heart. Coronary lockets they called them, with a narrow door and an interior mechanism that worked with biology and clockwork movement.\nShe\u2019d outlived everyone she cared about, and now was her time. She placed her hands back upon her chest, closed her eyes, and listened to the birdsong at her window. Orange blossom filled her senses, and her mouth lolled slightly open. Her chest rose and fell, and her heartbeat began to slow. Alys felt the sun roll across her and as its warmth finally dissipated, her heart whirred, and jarred, and stopped.\nAlys was finally where she wanted to be.\nLoving the photo prompt for Miranda\u2019s Mid-Week Flash Challenge over at Finding Clarity.\nThis entry was posted in Emotions, Fiction, grief, Mid-Week Flash Challenge, Steampunk and tagged aging, death, elderly, heart, heart failure, keys, Mid-Week Flash Challenge, old, Steampunk on 18th June 2017 by Lisa Shambrook."

She laughed and poked his nose watching his eyes cross. \u201cI have something for you.\u201d He said. She hadn\u2019t noticed the hand behind his back.\n\u2018Oh. Really now?\u201d She pulled her finger away and slowly reached around him, heading for the hidden gift.\n\u201cYou think I wouldn\u2019t notice that?\u201d He laughed.\n\u201cI thought you got lost in my eyes?\u201d She said gazing into Jaden\u2019s deep blue eyes.\n\u201cNot when I have something you want.\u201d He said sitting up quickly. She lay there a minute then smiled sitting up too.\nShe looked around her. There was a wide-open field with a lone weeping willow in the distance. She felt the slight cool breeze brush against her face and hair. She loved the warm weather and the slight breeze was just a bonus. She turned to him and smirked. \u201cI bet it\u2019s not that great or you wouldn\u2019t be hiding it for such a long time.\u201d Jaden laughed.\n\u201cThose tricks only work on guys who don\u2019t know you.\u201d She ignored his remark.\n\u201cSo. Gift or not?\u201d He looked up in the sky as if he had to contemplate his choices.\n\u201cWell I guess I could\u2026.\u201d But there was a sound. A sound that sent shivers down her spine into her core.\nThat sound wasn\u2019t right. Not in this place. Not with him.\nShe stood straight up and was looking around like a hawk scanning for its prey.\nThere wasn\u2019t anything in sight. Jaden stood up next to her and put his hand on her shoulder softly. \u201cWhat is it Lena?\u201d He whispered even though he wasn\u2019t sure why.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t hear that?\u201d She said taking her eyes off of her screening of the area.\nHer body tightened as she heard it again. Only closer. Her eyes shot around the field again scanning, straining to see as much in the distance as she could. Jaden\u2019s grip tightened on her shoulder, enough to pull her gaze back to him.\n\u201cWhat are you hea\u2026\u201d She cut him off before he could finish.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t right. Not here. We have to go.\u201d She grabbed him pulling him as she ran in the direction of the tree, the only safe place.\nJaden was stumbling behind her all confused, she could feel him starring his questions at the back of her head.\n\u201cThe tree is the only safe place. We have to get there.\u201d She answered his unsaid question. The tree didn\u2019t seem this far. They were still running. The sound was getting closer. It started to echo. She couldn\u2019t place the direction or the source. She grabbed Jaden\u2019s hand and squeezed it tight, they both picked up speed.\nThe tree was getting closer now she knew the only choice was to make it or\u2026 No, the only choice was the tree.\nThe sound was almost on top of them but for some reason Jaden didn\u2019t hear it. She didn\u2019t care he would see soon enough.\n\u201cWe have to climb that willow.\u201d She had to force out. Her lungs were on fire from running what seemed miles. She could feel him breathing hard and could tell they were both pushing off the ground harder with every step but only slowing down.\n\u201cI.. have\u2026 to .. Stop.\u201d He managed to get out as he slowed down, not letting go of her hand he stopped her dead in her tracks.\nThe sound, not coming from around them but from in front of her\u2026. From him.\nHer eyes widened at the realization and she let go of his hand stumbling backwards. \u201c No\u2026 No\u2026 No\u2026\u201d Was all she could manage to get out."

Thick, sturdy branches, rooted deep into the earth.\nIt was a prayer, a desperate plea to God, to gods, to the mother goddess or any other deity whose power she could beseech. It didn\u2019t have to be like this, others didn\u2019t feel these things, didn\u2019t need these things. Others could enjoy the clear night calmly, cozy between the warmth of a fire and the warmth of a lover. Laughing and cuddling and whispering sweet nothings until returning to their cabin for the night, or else scampering playfully in the moonlight. She struggled anew at the ropes, yet they only dug more harshly into her wrists and ankles, keeping her from her vision.\nFor a moment, she closed her eyes and allowed herself to dream her wish was granted, the ropes snapped, her limbs returned to her. She was free, free to. . . to what?\nShe felt his hand caress her face, sweeping away the hair from her forehead and gathering it into his fist. She lifted her chin when he pulled, obeying and yet resisting just enough to feel the tension, to feel his will exerting itself over her.\n\u201cRelease me,\u201d she gasped again. The tension vanished and in its absence her head snapped back down and her eyes flew open.\nHe walked behind her, and she stared into the fire, it\u2019s raging flames echoing her own thoughts.\nShe heard the crack of the lash well before the pan registered, but when it did she screamed her displeasure, the only form of resistance she could manage while tied in place.\nThe fire warmed her font as the lash warmed her back until the glow from each side reached her heart. She no longer cried out, absorbing the pain, letting it course through her, rinsing away what it would. Time, agony, no longer existed for her, as she allowed her lover to carry her off, mind drifting away even as her body remained firmly tied.\nWhen she returned then they were side by side, lying next to the fire. Limbs entwined just as she imagined. Warmth of her fire sated by that of her lover, or perhaps stoked into something entirely different.\nAnd though her limbs were free, she was still his, bound by love more securely than any rope.\nI need to comment because that tale deserves recognition, although it operates outside of what I\u2019ll clumsily call my comprehension/empathy zone. You distil into a short ethereal piece all the hopes, fears, longings of a girl with that orientation which I\u2019ve seen spelt out more explicitly in fiction and various blogs.\nThis was well outside my \u201ccomprehension/empathy zone\u201d (love that phrase) until very recently- part of the reason for the ethereal feel is that I\u2019ve yet to really put words to these feelings."

The story of the crucifixion places Mary a few yards from the Cross. If the story of Mary is followed through the Gospels her heart must have been broken as she stood there at Calvary.\nAs Mary stood there at Calvary, those words would have gone through her head again and again.\u201dHis kingdom will never end\u201d, how could this be? How could such words, such hope, end at this place of death?\nIn Mary\u2019s mind, she would have recalled the happy months she spent with her cousin Elizabeth before the child was born. What had Elizabeth said? \u201cBlessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear!\u201d Mary must have wept at the memories of those happy days when she looked at the terrible sight before her. What had happened that her Son should undergo such suffering?\nMary would have remembered the night he was born: no fine lodging, but a dirty stable in a strange city; the visits by the strangers to see the child; the ride down into Egypt to preserve her new son\u2019s life. She would have remembered each moment as if it was yesterday.Those words of old Simeon would have come back to her as well. When they had gone to the Temple when Jesus was forty days old he had said, \u201cThis child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be spoken against, so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce your own soul too.\u201d The sword pierced deep into Mary\u2019s soul as she stood there at Golgotha, the place of the skull.\nMary would have thought back on the moments of astonishment, the moments when the wonder of Jesus was revealed: the time in Jerusalem when he was twelve years old, when they left the city without him and had returned days later to find him deep in discussion with the most learned men of the land; the wedding at Cana of Galilee when the wine ran out. Mary had seen no miracles yet, but she had no doubt that Jesus would turn the water into wine. There were many moments of astonishment.\nThere were even moments when she thought he had gone too far, the time that she and his brothers had gone to bring him home. Mary stood there hour upon hour, listening to the voices around her; the cries of pain, the shouts and the curses from the crowd and the soldiers. Mary stood and watched and listened.The disciple whom we believe to be John, the Gospel writer, stood there with her. They could do nothing, they could say nothing.In his agony, Jesus looks at her and says to her, \u201cDear woman, here is your son,\u201d and to John he says, \u201cHere is your mother.\u201d And from that time on, John took Mary to his own home.\nTo be nailed to a cross and left to hang there while you slowly asphyxiated is a horrifying thought. No-one would want to witness such a dreadful execution, yet Mary is prepared to go and stand at Calvary, perhaps she could do nothing but she would not leave Jesus to die alone, she would not desert him. Even if everyone else had gone, she would have still stood there. Jesus knows what great love his mother has for him and has great love for her. She has remained faithful right to the end and, in the middle of these events which are going to change the world, he is anxious she is cared for.\nOn Mothering Sunday it\u2019s appropriate that we remember Mary. Her love for Jesus was a mother\u2019s love for her Son. Mary\u2019s heart would have been broken, her soul cut through, but she stands there because she loves Jesus. In the story of Mary we have an example of what true love, true commitment means, to continue to believe, to continue to have faith, when everything else has gone."

                            "text": "With the right lighting, even an empty yard can look haunted and spooky. Here's how a clever use of lighting can creep out the neighborhood.\nTo make shadows loom large and creepy, place lights low to the ground and aim them slightly upward. The angle will produce elongated, deformed shadows when anyone or anything passes in front of the light. Even the family dog will cast a frightful shadow. If you want to create more specific shadow effects, paint or partially cover lenses, or position cutouts or other figures in front of the lights.\nChoose your colors wisely. Black lights are a Halloween classic, and you can have lots of fun with a black light on the front porch, but they tend to be more silly than scary. Dark blue lights are a more effective way to create a mystical scene\u2014moviemakers often use dark blue lights for moonlit nights or dark interior scenes. Hang a dark blue bulb in your porch-light fixture to turn your front porch into a shadowy dungeon, or use dark blue floodlights to bathe your front yard in eerie moonlight, which makes the perfect lighting for a graveyard display.\nFire is a great way to create spooky ambiance. The flickering orange light seems to deepen nearby shadows, and it makes them move and shift (or is that just something hiding in the darkness). Use a candle inside a classic jack-o'-lantern, which can cast some truly unnerving shadows if carved and positioned properly. Pose a pumpkin or two on the porch or in strategic (and safe) places in your front yard. You could also line your walkway with tiki torches, or just station a couple on either side of your porch. Make sure your open flames are positioned safely\u2014away from where people will walk\u2014and will not be a hazard. If you're not sure, you can always use flickering orange lights or electronic candles.\nResist the temptation to overuse strobe lights. Not only are they headache-inducing (and remember, you will be seeing them all night), they may look gimmicky if not executed just right. Instead, to create a sense of confusion or to suggest motion in a display, try flickering light, or a light that flashes at more random, slower intervals.\nAchieve the best and scariest possible Halloween lighting with a fog machine. Flashing or moving lights at various levels can suggest spirits moving around, or something with glowing eyes lurking in the fog. You can also create some cool effects with track lighting on the ground, where the color will be reflected and spread in the surrounding fog. Use it to create an eerie glow arising from a decorative grave or a trail of blood running from a gory display. Red lights are a good way to hint at blood, and bright green can make your fog look radioactive or poisonous."

                            "text": "Nightmares are the fear of the unknown and what happens after death. Many people become scared of spirits and ghosts. Darkness hides everything, and fear creeps in like a falling shadow.\nThe noise in an empty room can cause the mind to become conscious of a touch on the shoulder, a whisper of the breeze or the movement of a curtain.\nBut do all shadows hide those who wish to seek mischief?\nRuskington Manor had its secrets, the empty house played host to spirits on a halfway journey, but when two worlds collide there can only be one outcome.\nThe rain fell on his skin like icy shards penetrating his thin clothes.\nHe watched as it washed the ground, rippling across the cobbled streets in rivulets.\nThe sound of his footfall was lost in the whispering sound of the rain and the blur of the narrow street and buildings disappeared into the darkness as the boy headed towards the manor in the distance.\nThe house was silent in the darkness, its brick chimneys ghostly silhouettes on the skyline. The black windows were foreboding, and the thick front door unwelcoming to visitors.\nRuskington Manor lay at the end of a gravel drive amongst shadowy trees.\nScrambling towards the fading walls, they hid its past behind red brick and thick foliage.\nThe small glow of a lantern shone like a beacon through a window on the upper floor as the boy raised his hand, rattling his knuckles against the damp door. The hinges squealed quietly as the door swung open into the entrance hall.\nThe boy peered into the darkness as an uneasy breeze blew from the shadows within.\nGlancing upwards, an amber glow meandered towards the stairwell, drawing him towards an open door on the floor above.\nA gentle touch on the shoulder guided him towards the stairs and the flickering light above. He watched the shadows dancing on the walls and listened to the echo of doors creaking in the gloomy corners of the building.\nA sudden change in temperature chilled him to the bone and he was pulled into the darkness, alone.\nGracie stared up at the sky. It was a crisp white afternoon and she couldn't wait to explore the house.\nThe removal van was parked outside and her parents were busy unloading the furniture into the house.\n\"I'll go in and open all of the doors.\" Gracie said enthusiastically taking the heavy set of keys.\n\"Wait for Charlotte.\" her mother called as she ran towards the door.\nEvery room had a peculiar scent, but this one had a subtle odour, a smell she recognised as home.\nMost odours or smells can define a family, like lavender or sweet apple, just like her grandmother.\nThis was safe and reliable, everything she had ever known.\nThe front door was wide open so Gracie walked along the hallway, passing each door as she searched for the right key to open it. When she had completed the ground floor, she made her way upstairs to the bedrooms above, working her way past the bathroom until she came to the last door on the right.\nShe put the key into the door and paused. There was no real reason for her to go into that room; no reason to disturb it. She pulled her hand away and went back downstairs.\nSeveral boxes were stacked in the hallway, and clumps of snow lay across the floor discarded from heavy boots.\n\"That snowstorm came out of nowhere\" David Bellamy shook his coat.\nGracie looked out of the window; the snow was so thick she could hardly see across the garden.\n\"WOW! Can I build a snowman?\" she asked excitedly.\n\"No, not yet anyway\" her father replied \"I'd no idea we'd be getting a storm.\"\n\"Weathermen! They're so unpredictable!\" her mother quipped.\n\"We might as well wait it out; we'll unpack the boxes in the hallway and rearrange some of the furniture.\" \"What furniture?\" Charlotte asked. \"The furniture in the lounge, it was your great aunts.\"\nGracie pulled a face and walked through the double oak doors facing opposite. \"We'll have to use the microwave.\"\nGracie could hear her mother moving around in the hallway, lifting and moving boxes across the floor.\nThe darkness crept in quickly, the blizzard squeezing every inch of natural light from the passing day, and the lounge was the only space blessed with light as the house fell into dusty darkness.\nThe warmth from the fire filled the room and the flickering flames bounced from the ceiling to the floor in a bright orange glow. The muffled sound of laughter spilled into the empty corridors, struggling with the darkness. It failed, dying miserably away in the gloom.\nDavid Bellamy had a collection of poor jokes and bad stories which he took great pleasure in relating beside the fire, and as the room erupted into laughter, the sound soared above their heads into the darkened hallways, stirring the dust until it retreated to its quiet post.\nThe heavy chime of a grandfather clock echoed through the empty space as Gracie's father stepped forward to examine it in the dim light.\nAs the clock struck midnight, he checked his watch but the night was still young and the visibility zero outside.\nWith the storm worsening, the Bellamy family settled down for the night and waited until morning.\nGracie was like any other teenager, inquisitive, disruptive and prone to rebellious outbursts. Walking around the mansion in the pitch black seemed far more exciting than camping out in the lounge during a blizzard.\nThe rooms lay empty with nothing but greying cobwebs spun by inquisitive spiders hanging from the corners, and the echo of voices and footfall fell heavily on the bare floors.\nAs she walked around the corridors, she became more aware of the house and its space. Every room had its nooks and crannies, and every wall had its shadows, they either fell across the floor or climbed the walls. The lumpy mass that followed her every step was her own shadow, moving with the diffused winter light, and every spark was a doorknob until she came to the door to the attic.\nGracie had seen no reason to open it earlier and as she glanced behind her, she didn't give the lumpy shape a second thought.\nThe following morning, heavy snowfall had left a covering at least two feet deep and the family spent an hour clearing the path for the move to complete.\n\"This is just the beginning,\" David said, agitated \"it's going to get a lot worse\"\nThe Bellamy's couldn't have chosen a worse time to move house.\nThey hastily moved box after box through the driving snow alongside furniture and suitcases loaded to the brim.\nOccasionally, a spatter of brilliant sunshine sparkled off the whitewashed ground, but the rolling clouds returned, showering everything with heavy snowfall. The tumbling flakes drifted lazily from the skies until the wind changed direction, hurling the snow relentlessly to the ground.\nGracie was in no hurry. She could hear the sound of her mother's voice ruthlessly dictating what should be kept and what should be thrown out, failing to recognise the heirlooms still standing in some of the rooms.\nAbove the noise, the radio crackled, struggling for a signal in the stormy weather. The forecast was grim with more snow expected to fall in the coming days.\n\"Well,\" said her father stretching his arms \"it looks like we're pretty much stuck until the storm dies down.\" \"There's no rush David, we've just moved in,\" her mother replied lightly \"it's just as well we ordered some fuel before the snow fell.\"\nThe fire crackled merrily in the grate, and as the family busied themselves to keep warm, the storm arrived with ferocity shaking the house with its painful moans. David shovelled coal onto the fire.\n\"Nights like this are only good for one thing.\" he said with a meaningful expression.\n\"The telling of ghost stories.\" he replied with a cackle.\nMaybe it was the way it was said, or maybe the wind had finally found a chink in the house, whatever it was made Gracie and her mother shiver as David Bellamy launched into a tale of a headless spectre, made all too real by the groaning of the wind outside.\nGracie was sitting in the seat closest to the door. She suddenly became aware of the cold empty space behind her that seemed to cringe into the darkness.\nAs her father came to the end of the gruesome tale, his voice seemed more hushed than ever, and Gracie had to strain her ears to pick up the words, the more she tried the more impossible it became.\nShe suddenly felt cut off from everyone else; pulled further into the darkness, until the shadows released their hold.\nWhen Gracie went to bed, the sound of footsteps followed her upstairs, one set, two sets, her own set, .and then another.\nThe fourth set of steps persisted where the others had disappeared.\nShe climbed into bed, covering her head with the heavy duvet. Her eyes darted here and there without resting on a single spot until the darkness took over, and she fell almost reluctantly into a deep sleep.\nGracie opened the bathroom door and stepped inside. The room was dominated by a claw foot bathtub with gnarled iron legs jutting out at an angle. They clasped the floor like misshapen paws, and Gracie imagined them scuttling out of the bathroom when her back was turned.\nA mirror hung over the washbasin, and as she walked across the floor, she could see the bath reflected in its misty glass. She gazed slowly around the room and then peered expectantly over the side of the bath. It was empty, no shadowy shape lay in the depths and yet, she had the strangest sensation that she was being watched.\n\"I bet you a penny you can't make it to the top of the stairs.\" said a distant voice behind her.\nGracie turned; but she was alone in the room.\n\"Hello! Is anybody there?\" she called as the sound of footsteps disappeared along the hallway.\nGracie peered out onto the landing, her eyes wide in horror as the sweet smell of hay and freshly cut grass drifted from the bathroom.\nThe moment her foot touched the landing, she heard a rapping noise above her head.\nCurious, she followed the slow rap! rap! until she came to the narrow staircase leading to the attic.\n\"Well, it isn't midnight and I can't see any skeletons\" she muttered to herself as she began to climb the stairs.\n\"I'm coming to find you\" she called \"so if you're a ghost, you'd better come out!\"\nAs she reached the attic door a whisper of a breeze touched her face and the door silently opened. Footsteps echoed across the dusty floor as a shadow moved in the corner of the room, passing over cobwebs hanging from the ceiling.\nGracie watched as it drifted behind an old chair before moving towards the faint light.\nShe blinked once, twice, but the shadow remained still, opaque but with form; child-like but smaller than either she or Charlotte.\nThe chair jolted forwards in invitation as Gracie took a sideways step towards the door.\nA hushed silence fell across the room, and in a moment of terror she leaped from the attic and ran down the staircase as the door closed noisily behind her.\nShe ran along the landing until she reached the staircase to the ground floor, and then bounded down the stairs towards the kitchen.\n\"She's still here!\" she screamed as she pushed open the door.\nCharlotte turned around in surprise. \"Who's still here?\"\n\"Aunt Iris! She's in the attic!\"\n\"In the attic? Don't be ridiculous, we buried her month's ago.\" she replied.\n\"Oh well you didn't do it very well because she's back!\" she said breathlessly.\n\"Back? What do you mean she's back?\"\n\"Just what I said, she's back, and if it isn't her it's somebody else!\"\nIris Bellamy rose from the crumpled chair. Her bones still ached from the journey through the portal. Nothing seemed to be straightforward. Passing to the spirit world had so much red tape, it was ridiculous, a total headache for anyone, and now she was stuck floating about for eternity in the house she had tried to give away years ago.\nLife was such a bind, and she had the noisy residents to contend with.\nShe shuffled her feet and looked around the room. The attic was such as mess, and that servant boy had been in the house for centuries; if only she knew where he was.\nIris and William Bellamy lived at Ruskington Manor for sixty years, inheriting the house and garden from Sir James Bellamy, the fourth Duke of Ruskington.\nWhilst James was popular and outgoing, William was nothing more than a social hand grenade and his bad manners and peculiar sense of dress left him wide open for criticism.\nAfter several years, Iris gave up offering helpful advice and laughed openly at his loud ties and ridiculous suits. William had such a large ego that he was rarely phased by his wife's comments, and continued to aggravate while she mocked him whenever the chance arose.\nIris was ninety-four when she passed through the portal to the spirit world.\nThe decaying manor was placed in trust for her niece Charlotte, in the hope that it would be brought back to its former glory, minus the previous occupants; but something had gone terribly wrong and they were all stuck.\nIris had no idea that Ruskington Manor had a resident ghost, until Christmas Eve nineteen eighty-five when a series of peculiar events led to the revelation of a gambling debt in the Bellamy household.\nAlistair Murdoch was a young servant boy who was always getting into mischief. Every morning he sat on the top step of the staircase close to the Duke of Ruskington's private rooms waiting for his daily orders, one of which was invariably to spy on fellow members of the Duke's gambling ring.\nOne cold winter's night, the boy mysteriously disappeared after settling a debt with a local businessman, and for over a century the manor had played host to the boy's mischievous spirit.\nIris first set eyes on Alistair in the dining room.\nHe appeared beside her husband before tripping the butler as he stepped away from the dinner table.\nShe tried to ignore him, but his antics became such a nuisance that she called the parish priest in the hope that he would send him away.\nAlistair was too set in his ways and continued to live in the shadows causing mayhem in the house.\nNow that Iris had passed to the spirit world herself, she was determined to find him.\nShe gazed out of the window at the falling snow. The winter had set in early. The overgrown trees were almost invisible, and their sprawling branches creaked under the weight of snow and ice.\nIt would soon be Christmas, and that stupid servant boy would be tampering with the lights again.\nHe was such a nuisance, banging doors and rattling windows.\nIris barely had the strength to float let alone anything else. She sighed heavily and the sound of her breath sent a spider scurrying across a web.\nNothing had gone according to plan, and the transition hadn't been as easy as she thought.\nShe couldn't understand it; she'd planned everything meticulously to the last, yet here she was, still peering through a window.\nIris watched as the cold air froze the surface of the glass, scattering tiny patterns into the corners of the window frame. The garden looked horrendous and the house was even worse. The view to the stables was lost and the statues had been stolen years ago.\nIf only she could haunt the place like that annoying little boy; but where was he?\nGracie and Charlotte crept along the landing towards the bathroom.\nThe chilly air caught their breath in tiny clouds, and the creaking floorboards echoed in the empty space. The doors were closed against the winter cold, and Gracie eyed the handles warily as they moved along the landing.\n\"Are you sure you saw her?\" Charlotte whispered as they neared the bathroom door.\n\"Well, not exactly but I smelt something and saw an old chair move.\"\nCharlotte raised her eyebrows \"Where was that?\" she asked.\n\"The chair or the smell?\" Gracie replied.\n\"Well, the smell was in the bathroom and the chair was in the attic!\"\n\"It was like old hay\" Gracie began.\n\"Old hay? Aunt Iris didn't smell of old hay!\"\n\"Oh well, perhaps you do when you, you know what, pass on.\" Gracie nodded her head to one side.\n\"I don't think so Gracie,\" Charlotte replied impatiently \"nobody smells of hay when they you know what!\"\nShe peered around the bathroom door.\nThe room was empty. No shadows, just the large Victorian bath in the centre and the misty mirror on the wall. \"There's nothing in there\" she said quietly \"and there's no smell either.\"\nLet's try the attic\" Gracie whispered.\nCharlotte shot a glance across the landing. No shadows on the walls, no creatures lurking; apart from the grisly spiders in the corners.\n\"Why did you go up there in the first place?\" she asked.\n\"Because I heard footsteps.\" Gracie replied.\nThe house has been empty for months Gracie, it's probably a mouse.\"\n\"Just take a look.\" Gracie hissed.\nThe staircase was narrow and winding with one step missing from the full flight. Charlotte listened to the sound of her footsteps, the steady sound slightly off beat by the missing step. She casually brushed away flying cobwebs and reached for the walls to steady her legs.\nThe walls were covered in ancient cracked plaster, escaping decoration in the floral print of the other rooms. A forgotten space, it lay damp, dark and dismal without purpose, a staircase leading to nothingness. The falling shadows masked the end of the stairway and she turned and walked back down, leaving the offbeat sounds behind.\nCharlotte hadn't even gone through the attic door and Gracie hadn't noticed the missing step when she had climbed the stairs earlier.\n\"There's nothing\" Charlotte replied \"It goes nowhere, it's a staircase to nothing.\"\nGracie opened her mouth in surprise and then watched her sister stomp noisily down the landing. The doorknobs twitched with every step, and by the time she had reached the top of the stairs, the whole landing echoed with rattles and moans of the wind. The bathroom door closed with a click, the noise unheard by Charlotte who swept noisily down to the kitchen. Gracie held her breath and then rushed past the bathroom. She halted at the top of the stairs as the sound of laughter drifted across the landing. Gracie listened. That was no aging aunt, that was somebody else.\nGracie took the stairs two at a time, stopping mid-flight as something touched her shoulder, playfully tugging her hair. She turned sharply. She was alone, aside of a shadow moving cautiously across the wall. Gracie watched wide-eyed as it poured over the side of the banister and spilled onto the floor below. A flash of fur dashed by her legs and disappeared into the shadows, and, convinced it was a rat, she stepped slowly, placing one foot at a time on the stairs until she reached the bottom.\nThe shadow remained, hovering just above floor level until a disembodied arm took a swipe at an empty box. The sound of scraping cardboard quickly fell silent and Gracie's eyes started as a small figure darted towards the front door.\nLater that morning, the sockets in the manor began to lose power and the half-baked cannelloni in the microwave remained half-baked as David Bellamy tweaked at the old fuse box in the kitchen. As soon as he pulled, something pushed and the house was plunged into darkness amongst flying sparks and smoke.\nUpstairs in the drawing room, Olivia Bellamy straightened a portrait of the fourth Duke and then returned to the kitchen to test the sockets. As the door closed, the playful apparition stepped from the shadows and moved the portrait to the left again.\nUnseen footsteps strolled around the room, studying the orderly chaos of jumbled furniture and photographs.\nThere was something about the woman Olivia the shadow couldn't quite put his finger on it.\nThe others were Bellamy's, that was clear to see, but the woman was different, puzzling.\nShe was astute with figures, organised, practical and demanding. Not a typical Bellamy choice.\nThe Duke's generally managed their own finances, which unfortunately had been the reason for the decline in the manor. He frowned. That was exactly the reason why he was still here over a century later organising the Duke's affairs, or not.\nAlistair moved towards the window and looked out at the overgrown branches peering through the snow. The gravelled drive no longer swept to the gated entrance, and the once majestic trees scrambled awkwardly across the lawns. Their thorny arms reached across the windows, smothering every ounce of daylight from the sky.\nIt had been a cold night when he returned to the manor.\nCharles Bellamy had sent him on an errand to settle a debt with Miles Hemingway. The meeting hadn't gone according to plan, and Alistair was kidnapped by the businessman's' henchmen and taken to a cellar. He was bound and questioned about the affairs of Ruskington Manor, but his loyalty to the Duke was stronger than the concern for his own life.\nA blow to the head sent him spinning into a world of darkness, and he returned to a different world wearing the simple clothes he had arrived in. His untidy appearance had sent him into a head-on collision with a passing footman, and when he stole his uniform, the shadows no longer offered him the shelter he needed to haunt the decaying pile.\nIris passed into the scullery. The old butler sink was stained and she was tempted to turn on the taps and give it a good scrub, but it was pointless. All she could do was hover about in the hope of finding Alistair. The clock struck three in the hallway.\nShe moved towards the upper floor and along to the drawing room. She so hated it when David called it the lounge. The Duke's portrait had always hung in the drawing room, not the lounge.\nShe tutted impatiently, sailing through the door as Olivia appeared from the kitchen.\nAlistair loitered outside the bathroom. Gracie was still downstairs in the kitchen. He was sure that she could see him, well part of him at least and if not she could definitely hear him.\nHe wondered if any of the others had the gift.\nHe drifted down the landing towards the Duke's study and disappeared through the door.\nThe faded curtains hung loosely at the window and as he paced up and down above the threadbare carpet, the material billowed like a sail in the breeze.\nStepping into the Dukes private rooms was a privilege for any servant, more so for Alistair.\nThe stable boy had been jettisoned to the position of page servant and had rapidly become a trustworthy aid and messenger. Life on the other side of the tracks had opened him up to wealth and greed he could only ever have dreamed of. His life had been humble until he was plucked from the dilapidated cottage he shared with his family and taken to Ruskington Manor to work as a stable boy.\nHe slept in the hayloft, tended the horses during the day, prepared the carriages and saddled the hunters for visiting guests. The position of page servant had been a step up to a better life, had it not been for Hemingway and his men.\nAlistair drifted around the room gently touching the furnishings with his fingertips before disappearing into the folds of material on the window.\nIris meandered towards the library.\nThere were far too many books; most of them were so tattered they were not much better than hamster fodder. Drifting from room to room was so pointless, her skills hadn't developed properly and she was no more a spirit than an empty glass of air.\nThe sound of laughter came from somewhere down the hall.\nShe stepped forward hovering once again past the billiard room until she reached the drawing room.\nThe study door was open and the floor was littered with books. The music room was silent, and the sound of breaking glass came from the direction of the conservatory.\nIris paid little attention to the noise and moved purposely towards the laughter, poking her head through the panels on the door.\nIris still hadn't mastered the electrics in the manor. Moving things around was relatively easy, but anything to do with the sockets and fuses was beyond her scope for the time being at least.\nAlistair was good at most things, in fact he was probably more use to her in spirit form than he was in anything else.\nHe was the most annoying little ghost. Always causing problems at dinner parties and trashing the family tree at Christmas, and she was deeply suspicious of the shrinking levels of gin in the drinks cabinet.\nHe was capable of most of the spooky tasks at the manor and it was only right to assume that he was the secret ghostly tippler.\nIris stopped mid-flight. It would be Christmas in a few weeks.\nIf she couldn't locate Alistair by then, the entire house would be filled with spirits of every kind, one chasing the other.\nShe needed a plan; perhaps Gracie could help. Iris decided to pay her a visit.\nThe Bellamy's were seated close to the fire. Charlotte shot a glance at Gracie as she toyed with her mobile. Gracie was too old for imaginary friends. It made Charlotte feel uncomfortable knowing that her sister was a little kooky. She hoped that she wouldn't start talking to herself, it would be so embarrassing.\nShe lifted her head just in time to see a vase move across the room all by itself.\nAlistair had moved from the Duke's private rooms to the floor below and had been sitting quietly in the corner watching the two sisters. He felt a tinge of sadness; the girls were roughly the same age as he was the day he passed into the spirit world.\nSuddenly it seemed an eternity since he had been kidnapped and knocked into this darkened space.\nCharlotte contemplated throwing the vase back when the door flew open and the smell of stale gin drifted into the room. Alistair spotted a pair of slippered feet hovering above the floor. He waited, but the figure neither spoke or acknowledged his presence, they were merely concerned about the vase floating above the Bellamy's heads. The disembodied feet shuffled to and fro as a pair of arms waved frantically until the vase nose-dived into Gracie's lap.\nThe room fell silent. The Bellamy's held their breath as a shuffle of feet brought the figure to a standstill. Clearly invisible, Alistair let out a gentle cough followed by a deep gasp. The blast of air sent the flames in the hearth spiralling up the chimney. The slippered figure turned around oblivious to Alistair stepping out of the shadows.\nGracie stared down at the vase, her eyes wide in alarm. \"I think we need to leave.\" Charlotte said feebly. \"Nonsense!\" replied her father \"this is fascinating!\"\nIris raised her eyebrows in surprise. David had always been adventurous and he was clearly unphased by unexplained phenomena. Olivia turned sharply. Ghosts had never been her thing and living in a house with a floating resident wasn't very appealing. \"Perhaps we should call someone\" she suggested.\nThere's no need for that Olivia, it's only Aunt Iris. Who else would it be?\"\n\"Oh, well if that's what you think maybe you should ask her to leave?\"\nThe door swung open on creaking hinges, slamming noisily as Alistair brushed past. Olivia Bellamy was different in the shadows. The hollow of her eyes accentuated the length of her nose and there was something about the way she stood that startled Alistair.\nThe library door shook as he passed along the hallway to the kitchen flicking at lights and tapping windows until he reached the passage to the stairs. He felt alienated from the familiar darkness and a sudden surge of anger sent a shiver through the servant's bells as he turned into the scullery. Alistair had never been evil or violent, but there was something about Olivia that made him want to scream, or haunt Ruskington with a malice it had never seen.\nOlivia drew the curtains across the window, locking out the blackness of the night. The bitter cold trapped every ounce of moisture and icy patterns lay across the window, unbroken by the heat of the fire.\nCharlotte watched the flames dancing in the grate as her father poked the hot coals.\nHave you ever been to the attic dad?\" she asked casually.\n\"No, it was out of bounds when I was a child,\" he replied \"there'll be nothing there anyway apart from dead birds.\"\nSo there is a way in then?\" she quizzed.\n\"There is, but there's also a staircase to nowhere in the house. Don't ask me what's up there because it goes nowhere!\" he laughed.\n\"So how do you get in?\"\n\"You don't, it'll be too dangerous now so leave it. I'll check it out when I'm ready.\"\n\"And what about Iris?\" Olivia asked, \"She could be floating about forever if we don't do something about it, and she could well be in the attic!\"\nDavid Bellamy sighed deeply and suggested they all take a look in the morning.\nAlistair's darkening mood had sent a flurry of vibrations through the manor, disturbing furniture and rippling threadbare carpets.\nOlivia Bellamy had a broody expression. Her close-set eyes made her nose look too long and the way her hair fell over her shoulders made her face appear cloaked, hidden behind the low fringe and thick waves. Something stirred in him, as if a distant memory had returned to haunt him. He moved around the building, an eerie breeze creeping through every door.\nHe stopped when he reached the drawing room. Photographs lay flat on every surface and as he drifted across the room, his eyes opened wide in despair. The unmistakable resemblance was there, in the eyes, the nose and the mouth. The soft fall of the hair, the dark blue clothing. The expression was kind and the smile reassuring, but there was no mistake, or was there?\nAlistair glanced across the room to a pile of documents resting on a small table. The paper gently billowed to the floor as the pages moved with unseen hands. He swung around as the footman breezed into the room followed by Barnaby the stable cat. He glanced at Alistair with an air of indifference and scattered the fallen paperwork across the floor as he passed through the wall on his way to the games room.\nThe drawing room was a dishevelled mess with upturned furniture and paper strewn across the floor.\nWith the twitch of a finger, the draws of a writing desk flew open spilling out the contents.\nSatisfied with the chaos, Alistair followed the footman through the wall as a pair of books quietly left a shelf and rose towards the ceiling. Barnaby watched as they danced on the breeze casting shadows in the moonlight, and then pounced silently across the room, his tail dusting the door frame as he left.\nIris Bellamy floated motionless above the floor of the drawing room. She was still reeling from the comments Olivia had made about getting rid of her.\n\"Spiteful little madam!\" she muttered to herself \"after all I have done for Charlotte. Oh well\"\nShe moved across the room to the fireplace and glanced upwards towards the mirror. She sighed deeply. Why did she have to be so short? She couldn't see a thing in the mirror apart from the reflection of the curtains on the window, and then it suddenly occurred to her that ghosts don't have reflections. \"How ghastly\" she breathed heavily flipping a photo frame on its side.\nI can't even see myself let alone a servant!\" She spun around cutting through the edge of the mantelpiece with the tip of her shoulder. The sudden movement sent a flurry of sparks up the chimney and she stepped into the shadows in search of Alistair.\n\"I'm telling you, they have to go!\" Olivia's voice was excitable as she paced across the bedroom floor. \"Don't be ridiculous Olivia. And how do you know that there's more than one? It could just be Aunt Iris and she's harmless.\"\n\"Harmless? David, things are moving about in the house, I don't call that harmless!\"\n\"Perhaps if we try and contact her.\" he replied.\n\"And do what David? send her an email or get the girls to WhatsApp the lot of them! Perhaps we could tag them on Facebook!\"\n\"Now you're being ridiculous, Iris didn't have a laptop!\"\n\"I'm being serious, either they go or we do it's as simple as that!\"\n\"But it's Charlotte's inheritance Olivia.\"\nWell, maybe that's the reason they're all hanging about, they want to keep the old pile for themselves.\" \"They're dead Olivia, what could they possibly want with it? Nothing!\"\nBut they are doing something with it aren't they? They're haunting it!\"\nA door opened and the sound of footsteps disappeared down the hallway.\n\"Right, get the girls; we're going on a ghost hunt!\" David said gleefully rubbing his hands together.\nThe family moved quietly through the house. Shoulder to shoulder they shuffled in the darkness, guided only by a small torch light. The narrow beam danced across the walls, searching quiet corners and doorways for movement as anxious eyes peered into the gloom, knowing that the bumps of the night were not the central heating.\nThe Bellamy's started on the top floor close to the servant's quarters with its wooden floors and bare iron bedsteads, each one trying their best to feel something in its dark corners. Oddly, Olivia was the first one to actually feel anything. A drop in temperature sent a shiver down her spine and somewhere in the depths of silence she realised that they were not alone. Without warning, she felt something brush her shoulder. The air was strangely sweet and as she turned, the remains of a chocolate mousse landed on her head and dripped towards her chin.\nOlivia screamed \"I felt something!\"\nStartled, David shone the torch. The light caught the end of a globule of chocolate and David watched in horror as it balanced precariously on the end of her nose before plopping onto her white fluffy jumper. \"Wow! Somebody doesn't like you\" Charlotte quipped nervously.\nErr, I think we'd better leave; follow me and stay close.\" David reached protectively into the darkness.\nThey moved quickly along the upper floor, alert to the sounds of creaking floors and turning handles.\nThe air was cooler near the servant's rooms with a distinct odour, and the occasional rush of whispered voices. Alistair smirked as Olivia wiped her face and wrapped her arms protectively around Gracie and Charlotte.\nIn the diffused light, Alistair clearly saw the face of Miles Hemingway, and there was no mistaking the family tie. He moved quickly ahead passing through the group as they approached the staircase. The cold chill sent spiders scuttling in anticipation across dusty cobwebs, and small orbs of light, barely visible in the gloom, passed from one door to the next.\nGracie gasped as they rose and fell in the shadows, weaving their way through the banister to the ground floor where they disappeared though walls and ceilings.\n\"This place is full!\" she cried.\n\"Whatever you do don't provoke them!\" Olivia cried as they reached the top of the stairs.\nCharlotte looked nervously towards the front door.\nIt might be locked\" said Gracie in alarm \"or blocked by THEM!\"\n\"Well it clearly isn't Iris is it? She didn't have a nasty bone in her body!\" said David quietly.\n\"Well she's out of it now and who knows what she's capable of?\" Charlotte added.\nI don't think it was her that threw the mousse.\" Gracie said helpfully.\n\"I don't care who threw the mousse!\" Olivia wiped the remains of the chocolate from her face.\nActually mum I have something to tell you\" Gracie began.\n\"I was in the bathroom a few days ago when I heard a noise.\"\n\"Really, what sort of noise?\"\n\"Voices, and then someone ran through the house so I followed the noise to the attic. Only the door isn't there any more, but it was because I went inside. It's full of rubbish and dirty cobwebs. And there's an old chair that moved on its own. It was spooky and freezing.\"\nAnd what else was in there; a foul creature with bony limbs?\"\n\"No it was a shape the size of Charlotte.\"\n\"Why didn't you say something?\" her father asked.\n\"Because you wouldn't have believed me.\" Gracie replied sheepishly.\n\"That does it, we're leaving now!\"\nOlivia skipped down the stairs closely followed by Gracie and Charlotte as David flicked away cobwebs in the darkness. As the group moved quickly towards the front door, the heads on the family portraits turned after them, watching every move.\nGracie reached for the door handle as the sound of the car horn bellowed across the garden, and it's flashing headlights streamed through the dusty windows.\nThe family held their breath and peered into the darkness, wide eyed.\n\"Have you got the car keys David?\" Olivia whispered.\n\"No,\" David Bellamy gulped \"they're in the bedroom beside the clock.\"\n\"I'm not getting in the car!\" said Charlotte nervously.\n\"Neither am I\" Gracie added.\n\"Just open the door!\" David Bellamy lunged forward and pulled at the handle. He tweaked and twisted the ancient brass door knob but the door remained tightly closed.\n\"What did I tell you?\" Gracie cried \"they've locked us in!\"\nCharlotte reached for the light switch beside the door.\n\"Don't touch anything!\" Olivia said alarmed.\n\"OK\" David shouted \"That's it you lot! If you think you're going to get away with this you're not. And that goes for Aunt Iris too. I don't care if you left this old pile to Charlotte or not, you'll stop this business now or I'll call the priest!\"\n\"Don't tell them that!\" Olivia hissed.\nA loud thud came from somewhere near the library as Iris mastered the art of blowing the electrics in the manor. Alistair had been standing close by sneering at Olivia.\nHow dare a Hemingway set foot in the Duke's house? Overwhelmed by bitterness and anger, he threw himself across the floor sending Olivia to the ground in a crumpled heap.\nThe air became very still as Alistair hovered beside the window. Beams of light from the car headlights caught a smattering of tiny floating particles falling through the air, and in the diffused light, Gracie saw the outline of Alistair's face.\nHis eyes were deep, almost sunken, and his thin lips were fixed in a painful smile.\nHe slowly raised an arm, sending a chilly breeze through Gracie's hair.\n\"I can see him.\" Gracie gasped, helping her mother to her feet.\n\"A boy, he looks like a servant.\"\nAlistair breathed heavily, seeking Olivia's attention.\nThe sound of crunching snow distracted the Bellamy's momentarily as a police car pulled to a halt behind the family Volkswagen. David peered through the windows as the officer climbed wearily out of the police car and studied the Volkswagen.\nThe horn was still blaring and the headlights flashed intermittently like a pair of eyes blinking in the daylight. The officer checked the interior of the car and shot a glance at the manor.\nThe single track of tyres in the snow had disappeared under fresh snowfall, and it was clear that the Volkswagen hadn't moved for several hours.\nIn the dim light, David Bellamy's face was pale and gaunt; almost ghost like behind the glass.\nThe police officer eyed the stationary vehicle suspiciously and then turned his attention to the manor.\nThere were no visible footprints apart from his own, and it was clear to him that the Volkswagen was an abandoned getaway car, unless the burglars were trapped inside the empty mansion.\nHe shone his torch at the front door and checked for signs of forced entry. The lock was clean, and there were no signs of splintered wood in the snow. As he reached for the door handle, the face at the window caught his eye. Masked by shadows, the face was full of anguish, and its ghoulish smile sent a momentary shiver down Henry Perkins spine.\nDavid lifted his hand to wave and then frantically pointed towards the door. A halo of mist appeared on the glass, and David looked more menacing than ever.\nHenry Perkins opened his eyes in alarm. Ruskington Manor had been empty for months; with no sign of activity since Iris Bellamy had passed away.\nThe man at the window was obviously a thief, an incompetent one at that.\nHenry Perkins had caught him red handed. He decided to call for backup. In his experience there was usually more than one thief, and this was no exception.\nA place like Ruskington could be swarming with thieves, dealers or squatters.\nHe returned to the patrol car, requesting assistance from other officers in the area.\nThe struggling signal failed to connect, and the officer was forced to deal with the issue alone.\nHe climbed out of the car and shone his torch at the window.\nDavid was still standing in the darkness, his ghostly silhouette fading into the shadows.\n\"Open the door!\" Henry Perkins glared at the Bellamy's as they crowded around the window, peering into the torchlight.\nInside the manor, Alistair had begun to move the furniture in the dining room and Iris was practising her newly acquired skills in the music room, including banging an eerie melody on the piano keys.\nThe haunting sound of music drifted through the quiet hallways filling the empty space.\n\"I think we need a priest.\" Gracie whispered.\n\"You'll need more than a priest.\"\nThe voice came from the direction of the front door. The Bellamy's turned to see Henry Perkins standing inside the hall.\n\"You're under arrest for trespassing.\"\nDavid Bellamy leaned against the counter in Little Muxley police station.\nHenry Perkins hadn't believed a word he was saying and had arrested the entire family.\n\"So, Ruskington Manor is yours is it?\" The duty constable peered at him over dark rimmed glasses.\n\"Yes, it belonged to my late aunt Iris Bellamy; she left it in trust to my daughter Charlotte. We've just moved in.\"\n\"Have you got a problem with the electrics then?\"\n\"No, not exactly.\" Olivia replied.\n\"Oh? So you just sit in the dark with the doors locked and leave your car headlights on for fun then? It's past midnight and most people are in bed.\"\n\"Ah yes; I can explain.\"\n\"Yes, so I've heard, Poltergeists isn't it?\"\nThe constable raised an eyebrow and continued to tap furiously on the keyboard.\n\"Well we're not actually sure, but there's something odd about the house.\"\nOlivia tugged David's sleeve as Henry Perkins appeared in the doorway of the interview room.\nAre we going to be charged constable? It's a bit ridiculous to charge someone for living in their own house!\" David laughed nervously.\n\"We just need to clarify a few things Mr Bellamy.\" the constable replied lifting his head \"If you'd like to follow Officer Perkins into the interview room somebody will be with you shortly.\"\nThe Bellamy's walked solemnly into the light blue room and closed the door behind them.\nThe sound of muffled laughter escaped from the room as a well-built officer in a grey suit disappeared through the door carrying a file.\nOutside the station, the bitterly cold wind whipped through the spiked icicles hanging from the roof, snapping the weakest ones mid length.\nThey fell to the ground in delicate shards where they lay like broken diamonds in the snow.\nA ruffle of fallen snow edged its way along the path, stopping at the entrance to the station.\nThe doors breezed open and Alistair stepped into the light.\nAlistair's ghostly shadow passed across the floor.\nIn a haze of mist, it cut through the seating area, hovering momentarily before drifting towards the operations room on the upper floor.\nThe duty constable shuddered as he passed and then glanced at the CCTV screen.\nThere were no signs of movement.\nHe quickly glanced around and then walked towards the door.\nThe world outside was silent and the sky was grey with a hint of fresh snowfall as Alistair floated along the silent corridor, peering through windows and rattling door handles until he reached the door to the operations room.\nThe room was full of flashing screens and ringing bells, and dark figures lurked beside the windows.\nHe passed quickly through the door, knocking over a coat stand on the way in. The stand was heavy, and narrowly missed a filing cabinet when it fell to the floor. Alistair moved slowly across the room leaving a trail of static behind him. Tiny sparks rose from the carpet and a gentle buzzing soon became a loud crack as the main fuse blew in the circuit board.\nMuxley police station was thrown into darkness and the excitable hub was reduced to a silent whisper. Downstairs in the interview room, chairs shuffled as Officer Perkins ploughed through the door with the Bellamy's to the front desk.\nBy the time they had reached the counter, the backup generator kicked in and the station was flooded with light.\nConstable Watkins eyed the group suspiciously.\n\"They're free to go,\" said Henry Perkins \"on the proviso they contact the vicarage!\"\nThe officers watched as the family stepped reluctantly into the darkness, their feet quickly disappearing into the snow.\n\"They could have given us a lift.\" said Olivia shivering in the cold.\n\"How are we going to get home?\" Gracie asked through chattering teeth.\n\"Taxi I suppose.\" David peered into the darkness as a flurry of snowflakes fell gently to the ground.\nOlivia stared at the dismal skies \"We can't walk home in this, we'll freeze.\"\nThe sound of an engine pierced the silence as a battered transit van chugged to a halt on the road opposite the station.\nThe family watched as an elderly man in a dressing gown climbed out and lifted the bonnet.\nA pall of smoke escaped into the air along with the smell of burning rubber, and as the smoke cleared, the man leaned forward and began to pull something out of the engine.\nAfter several minutes he returned to the van, leaving the bonnet open.\nAs he climbed into the driver's seat he noticed the family standing in the snow.\nThe van engine had overheated and he would be on his way to the vicarage in no time, but he couldn't possibly leave without offering to help a stranded family.\nGeoffrey Symington climbed back out of the van and walked very slowly through the deepening snow.\nHis thick fur lined boots kept his feet warm and dry, but the wind soon whipped through his frayed woollen gown.\n\"Good evening, forgive me for asking, but can I be of any assistance?\"\nThe family were huddled together against the cold and eyed the dilapidated van which was clearly un-roadworthy.\n\"Are you stranded? Because I'll be happy to give you a lift once Lizzie has cooled down a bit, she's a little overheated at present, but you're more than welcome to sit in the van until she's ready to move.\"\n\"That's very kind of you.\" Olivia chattered \"Yes, we are stranded and it's too far to walk in the snow.\" she blabbed.\n\"Please follow me; you'll be much better out of the cold. I'm Geoffrey Symington by the way, the Vicar of St Martins.\nGracie nudged Charlotte. Geoffrey Symington was the perfect winter visitor.\n\"We're the Bellamy's\" David replied \"from Ruskington Manor.\"\nGeoffrey's eyes widened in surprise \"Ruskington Manor? Oh I see, well it's better than it going to rot I suppose. Have you been there long?\"\n\"We moved in a few days ago.\" Olivia replied.\n\"I see, very interesting.\" he replied pulling the van door open, \"Do step in.\"\nThe rusty door struggled for a moment and then closed with an awkward clunk.\nThe van was full of boxes stacked in unruly piles against a wooden bench, and the floor was littered with polystyrene beads.\nDavid and Olivia slid onto the bench followed by Gracie; leaving Charlotte slumped on the floor beside a reindeer with a broken antler.\n\"So, do you like living at Ruskington? The manor has been part of the ministerial circuit for a number of years, although I've never visited it myself.\"\nGeoffrey Symington was a likeable character, a little eccentric with a hint of magic.\nCharlotte's heart leaped. The vicar's appearance was comforting, perfectly timed and the perfect solution. Somehow he made the ghostly goings on at the manor more bearable.\nAll they had to do was convince him to stay.\nLizzie, the junk mobile, was soon moving carefully along the snow bound roads towards the Manor.\nOlivia was reluctant to return, but in order to leave; they had to return to collect the car. She only hoped that the cheeky little poltergeist hadn't done anything other than tamper with the headlights, and the thought of Gracie having hallucinations was more than she could bear.\nShe pushed her hands deeper into her pockets and crossed her fingers.\nThe thickening snow was unforgiving, and the van crawled, slipped and jolted its way through silent streets, until reaching the desolate road to the manor.\nThe roof line was just visible through the snowy haze and its chimneys appeared through ragged trees reaching for the sky.\nThe gate to the manor was open, held back by freezing snow and ice, and navigating the final stretch of road was difficult without markers.\nIris Bellamy was busily trying to rearrange the furniture in the dining room when the van pulled to a halt outside. She'd grown tired of playing the piano and had drifted towards the entrance hall when Alistair plunged through the wall in pursuit of the patrol car.\nShe peered through the window as the van crunched to a halt. The van was barely visible against the snowy backdrop, and when the group emerged, they resembled visiting ghosts from a neighbouring parish.\nDavid Bellamy pushed the door open and stepped inside. The house seemed strangely inviting as the family filed into the hall. Charlotte had been the first to step out of the van, and waited motionless for the others to join her. Geoffrey Symington smiled at Gracie as she grasped her mother's hand and stumbled towards the house.\nThe distant clattering was less disturbing, and the forbidden corners of the manor seemed to open out in welcome to the rather unconventional visitor as Geoffrey Symington, vicar of St Martin's, stepped into the darkness.\nThe vicar gazed in awe at the high ceilings and sweeping staircase.\nIn the grey light the house looked surreal, with the faded gilding on the picture frames providing a dash of sparkle. Delicate orbs of light danced across the floor like fairy lights in a woody dell. In a magical display of blue and shimmering silver, they darted here and there, rising and falling without fear of discovery from those who believe in other planes of existence.\nGeoffrey's eyes wandered across the walls to the large mullioned windows and back to the empty fireplace.\n\"It's marvellous, but you do have a problem with your light bulbs.\"\nCharlotte shot a glance at Gracie, and Olivia raised her eyebrows in surprise.\n\"We had a power cut.\" she stammered.\n\"I see, well I have travel lamp in the car, there's still a bit of juice in it.\"\nGeoffrey turned to open the door but it was tightly shut against the falling snow.\n\"Oh dear, I'm afraid I might be stuck here for the night.\" he said peering out of the window.\nThe gentle snow storm was now a blizzard, and the ghostly figure approaching the manor was no more than a whisper in the wind.\nGeoffrey Symington was seated comfortably by the fire, his shadowy figure spilling across the arms of the chair. His eyes sparkled as he studied his surroundings with interest. The room was warm and comfortably furnished with a scattering of family photographs in various frames. His wizened face was darkened by the dim light, but as daylight broke through the clouds, he took on an almost surreal appearance by the fire.\nThe touch of a breeze flowed through the empty spaces and a glimmer of light danced across the upper floor. Bouncing tiny beams shattered in the daylight leaving behind obstinate flecks that tricked the eye. Alistair had startled the spirits.\nThe gentle energy of the house was being drawn, almost partitioned, by a negative force with depth and meaning, a dark brooding force intent on destruction.\nGeoffrey twitched his nose. He had a spiritual energy, radiating kindness and compassion without judgement and he sensed that the falling silence wasn't welcoming.\nThe presence of a negative force tipped the balance between magic and the real world, and he was compelled to assist the inhabitants of the manor in any way he could.\nThe stillness crept in slowly until he felt the feathery touch move across his face.\n\"It must be fascinating living in the manor, so much history.\" The kindly old man smiled at Olivia. She was agitated. The stillness was uncomfortable and she was glad of a break in the silence.\n\"It's centuries old with lots of dark corners and creepy histories.\" she replied.\n\"And a resident ghost I presume?\" he said lightly.\nOlivia laughed, shrugging her shoulders as David shovelled coal onto the fire. Charlotte nudged Gracie. There was more than one unwanted guest in the house. Aunt Iris was floating about completely disembodied and the servant boy was the closest to a poltergeist Gracie had ever seen.\nAs for the rest of them, they could be anywhere at any time, spooking.\n\"About who? Aunt Iris or the servant?\"\n\"How do you know it's a servant?\" Charlotte asked.\n\"Because I saw him\" Gracie replied.\n\"He should be easy enough to find then, he won't be able to hide and the vicar can throw him out.\"\n\"What about Aunt Iris? She left you the house remember!\" Gracie hissed.\nOlivia watched the two girls closely. Heads together they were so like their father. There was very little Hemingway in there at all. Gracie's expression could be similar to her grandfather's when the mood took, but there was no mistaking that she was a Bellamy.\n\"What are you two whispering about.\" she asked.\n\"Ghosts!\" Charlotte shot a glance at the vicar as Olivia shifted uncomfortably in her seat.\n\"Ghosts!\" Geoffrey laughed \"Ghosts are spirits who are either stuck midway between two worlds or they have unfinished business on earth, according to legend anyway.\"\n\"We've got two!\" Gracie said excitedly.\n\"We've got loads!\" Charlotte added.\n\"Girls!\" Olivia said sharply \"Don't be ridiculous.\"\n\"We're not being ridiculous, one of them dropped a chocolate mousse on mums head!\"\nGeoffrey looked bemused \"Oh dear, malevolent beings can be a nuisance and they do become obstinate when they're asked to leave.\"\nOlivia looked alarmed. She had left her enthusiasm for haunted mansions behind in a classroom thirty years ago.\n\"Can you help us vicar?\" Gracie asked sweetly.\nGeoffrey clasped his hands in thought.\nOlivia was doubtful. Geoffrey had already mistaken the orbs for flickering light bulbs. One more tiny mistake could leave them all stuck in the manor in a head on collision with spooks and spirits leaping from every corner. She was beginning to wonder if it was all part of an elaborate plan, she hardly dared admit to her grandfather's connection to the manor, but perhaps somebody else had.\nThe room was eerily silent. Charlotte watched as the ashes from the fire fell softly onto the hearth.\n\"So these spirits have unfinished business with the manor?\" he asked.\n\"Possibly, activity in general indicates intention.\" replied the vicar.\n\"That means you mum,\" Charlotte said uneasily \"you're the one who got hit.\"\n\"Nonsense, that mousse could have landed anywhere.\" Olivia replied.\n\"But it hit you mum, and it might happen again.\" Charlotte was adamant.\nAlistair leaned towards the gentle little man, blowing in his ear, but when he raised a hand to move the armchair it remained fixed to the floor by an invisible force.\n\"It appears you have a dilemma.\" Geoffrey said quietly.\n\"We do vicar.\" David was cautious, unwilling and unsure if his words were reaching the unseen through the walls and ceilings above.\nGeoffrey's gaze was direct \"Well, my appearance could not have been better timed.\"\n\"Indeed vicar, indeed.\" David watched as the flickering flames began to draw further up the chimney, hissing and spitting their way across the blackened brick.\n\"Perhaps if we move to the affected areas,\" Geoffrey began \"the areas of activity. Attics are usually a good place to start in old houses, or kitchens.\"\n\"What if it's the whole house?\" Gracie asked.\nGeoffrey tapped the end of his nose and then reached into his pocket pulling out a leather bound book and a small round object very like a clock or compass, with hands pointing to various places on the dial.\n\"Dunno, a watch maybe.\" Charlotte replied.\nGeoffrey polished the glass dial with his dressing gown sleeve, studying it intensely.\nThe device was a truth telling instrument that could analyse dreams and create answers to the unknown, the unexplained. It also analysed dust, and the dust in the manor was made from elementary particles of the spirits who remained in its walls. The small golden dial could read the colourful auras radiating from each one.\nGeoffrey moved his lips in silent prayer and returned the strange looking object to his pocket.\n\"Shall we make a start?\" he moved slowly, clutching the book tightly in his hands.\nOlivia nervously followed Geoffrey through the hallway.\nShe began to wish that she had been more open with David when they met. The way Iris looked at her was almost a dead giveaway. The old lady had never really taken to her and Olivia had been totally surprised when she had left Ruskington Manor to Charlotte. The trust fund was a bonus too, but if David ever found out that the Hemingway's had tried to take the manor all those years ago, Olivia would lose everything, including the girls. As she wandered through the gloomy hallways, she knew that the house sensed her betrayal. She drew in a deep breath; the unwelcomed occupants would have to leave.\nThe walls seemed to breathe as the group moved through the quiet building.\nWhispers echoed in empty rooms as they passed from one floor to the next. Charlotte's eyes fell to her feet as pooling water merged and crystallised into a patch of solid white, reflecting splashes of light across its surface. Something touched her ankles, like weeds breaking through cobbled pathways.\nShe pulled her shoulders tight, huddling to keep warm.\nSomewhere ahead, a door lay ajar allowing a delicate glow to meander across the floorboards. As they reached the open door, the smell of candle wax drifted into the hallway. Gracie cringed at each creak of the oak floor until something flickered in the corner of her eye.\nAlistair followed close behind, but never quite reaching Olivia who walked behind the girls with David. Several doors opened of their own accord, and the rush of footsteps faded as the Vicar of St Martins approached. Behind him, laughter followed the sound of splintering wood as he reached for the magical little compass in his pocket.\nGeoffrey watched the needles spin gently to the left, before turning full circle where they hovered, before coming to rest, their points facing the wall. He waited until they were completely still before declaring the energy force was positive. He moved on towards the door leading to the former Duke's private room, where he stopped and studied the readings.\nOlivia was uncomfortably close to Alistair but he was unable to penetrate the energy field around them. Instead he back tracked, ripping through the ground floor, leaving a trail of destruction behind him.\nVoices whispered in her ears \"We know.\" and the feathery touch of unseen hands tousled her hair as she trod warily behind the children.\nDavid sensed her unease and wrapped a protective arm around her shoulders.\n\"They'd better be gone by Christmas.\" her voice cracked in the chilly air \"I couldn't tolerate another round of Bach's greatest hits.\"\nIris poked her head through a panel on the wall.\nThe house was alive with glowing orbs and peculiar smells clinging to the heavy atmosphere, and the footman had been suspended from the ceiling of the morning room for hours.\nShe'd never seen so much activity.\nShe stepped though the panelling and followed a flickering ray of light through the house until she spotted the Bellamy's huddling together outside the dukes private rooms.\nShe watched the walls come alive with disembodied heads, their necks outstretched like freakish creatures. Raw boned and pinched, they pulled at the air with scraggy arms.\nThe needles on the compass spun anti clockwise, barely stopping on its central pivot.\nGeoffrey laid the compass across the open pages of the book and watched as the walls became a knotted mass of body parts, all seemingly trying to escape the hold of the ageing bricks.\nCharlotte gripped Gracie's hand in terror.\n\"You have got a problem haven't you?\" Geoffrey called above the increasing noise \"They appear to be guests of a malevolent spirit!\"\n\"Guests!\" The Bellamy's looked on horrified.\nIris stopped abruptly behind Olivia. She had never seen so many ugly people. She tapped Olivia lightly on the shoulder.\n\"I've no idea who they are.\" Her voice was barely a whisper until Geoffrey Symington turned around.\nOlivia's eyes opened wide in alarm.\n\"Get them out,\" she hissed \"get rid of the lot of them!\"\n\"You nasty piece of work!\" Iris spat \"After all I've done. How dare you!\"\nThe house began to groan, and the whispering voices became louder, forcing the group to take refuge in the library.\nGeoffrey waved his arms in the air, catching invisible objects and throwing them through the windows. Charlotte and Gracie watched bemused as his gathering strength quickly gained momentum, and the powerful moans of the house were lost in the screams of the departing spirits.\nA sudden rush of wind carried a stream of tiny orbs through the window and the garden became a magical world of sparkling light.\nIris had located Alistair and was busy berating him for the chaos he'd caused for decades.\nHe brushed her aside and paced the hallway searching for a weakness in the energy field.\n\"I can see you,\" she spluttered \"I don't know how you got here but you've been causing trouble for years. And who are they?\" She waved an arm at a group of spirits emerging from the floor outside the library. Arms reached through the wooden floor with spindly fingers grabbing at the air, touching and feeling like spiders on a web.\nAlistair's mouth fell open, distorted and twisted like a rubber band, and a loud groan echoed along the hallway.\nInside the library, Geoffrey lay slumped in a chair exhausted. His eyes flickered and his mouth swung open revealing a set of gapping teeth.\nOlivia shuddered as the noise from the hallway filtered through the door.\nCharlotte and Gracie watched in awe as a ribbon of colour swirled across the garden, barely touching the tips of exposed leaves and branches poking through the snow.\n\"I'm exhausted.\" Geoffrey whispered, \"The house is full.\"\n\"They're leaving\" said Gracie as the ribbon rose to the sky, fading gently into a white cloud.\nDavid opened the door, peering into the hallway. Shadowy figures lurked and fingers circled the handle on the door dragging it open with a muffled creak.\nGeoffrey cracked open an eye \"David will have to do it, I'm exhausted.\"\n\"David! How on earth is he supposed to do that?\" Olivia panicked.\nShe was doubtful that anything would work. The walls were full of spooks and ghoulish beings rooted to the foundations. Asking David to throw any of them out was a recipe for disaster, but leaving the manor wasn't an option. The living were more important, and if the resident spooks didn't like it they could argue at a later date.\nDavid was alarmed. He couldn't see a thing as he stepped out into the hallway.\nThe chilly air rasped at his throat and the touch of fingers reaching across his face sent a shiver down his spine. The hallway expanded into nothingness with doors opening into a dozen horrors.\nHe cringed as the floor began to creak and he was tempted to return to the library but Olivia would never forgive him, and the girls would be disappointed if the house remained stubbornly occupied by freakish little creatures.\nHe moved carefully across the floor until a door opened somewhere ahead.\nHe turned around sharply knocking an off centre picture frame to the floor.\nA lone mouse eyed him curiously before scuttling into the shadows, and he found himself tip toeing through the house in search of ugly ghouls and Aunt Iris.\nAlistair followed at a discreet distance, whilst Iris floated behind shouting abuse into his right ear.\nDavid felt the breeze behind him and as he turned, a pair of bony hands grasped his head, pulling him backwards.\nBlack knotted fingers pulled at the skin across his face. They probed his nostrils, creeping through his hair to the nape of his neck and touching his shoulders.\n\"Right! That's it! Get out, the lot of you. You've been told now hop it!\" David screamed.\nIris ducked as a spindly arm flew out of the wall followed by a spinning head with a short fat neck.\nA pair of beady eyes flashed for a second and disappeared into a picture rail as Iris gingerly popped back up.\nDavid's eyes had begun to play tricks, and the dusty corners of the house were now full of beady eyes eager to frighten intruders. With each footstep, the house became more hostile, and he was determined to find out why.\nThe library door flew open and David stepped in to a sea of surprised faces.\n\"How do you contact spirits with that thing?\" he asked pointing to the compass.\n\"You don't need to contact them; they're all over the house.\n\"What are we going to do dad?\" Gracie asked \"I don't want to live in a creepy house, and we've got nowhere else to go.\"\nIris passed through the doorway, closely followed by a pair of crooked little arms which quickly retreated in silence. Outside the library, voices were distant but audible and the freakish ghouls crawled across the floor with bony limbs scraping glass and wood. Creeping and crawling like curious animals they grasped the door handle.\nDavid pulled open the drawer in a writing desk.\nHe quickly scribbled on a piece of paper. Minutes later he announced he'd got it, the reason why the manor was haunted was due to nosiness and revenge.\n\"Yes nosiness, they can't stand the thought of not knowing.\"\n\"Not knowing what?\" Charlotte asked thoughtfully.\n\"What we're doing\" David replied.\n\"And the revenge?\" Olivia looked sheepish.\n\"Well, you've obviously done something Olivia.\"\n\"I haven't done anything.\" Olivia replied defensively.\n\"Unless it's a secret!\" Gracie's eyes widened as a shadow passed across the floor.\nIris listened intently. Perhaps there was a secret. Alistair's anger wreaked havoc throughout the house and the freaks were refusing to leave. She twitched her nose and floated towards Gracie. She'd been meaning to pay her a visit, now was as good a time as any.\n\"He's a nuisance,\" she whispered \"and it's all to do with your mother. Tell your father to stop messing around and throw him out with the freaks. I'm tired of tripping over them and they're spitting all over the floor!\"\nGracie screamed in alarm \"Aunt Iris says throw him out because he's a nuisance and the freaks are spitting all over the floor!\"\n\"Aunt Iris!\" Olivia swung around in surprise.\n\"She's shouting down my ear!\"\n\"David, do something!\" Olivia shrieked.\nThe door flew open and a mass of creeping arms slithered across the floor, groping at Olivia's feet. Charlotte grabbed a cushion, frantically beating the floor as the crown of a skull rose through the floorboards under a mass of unruly hair. It spilled across the carpet as the room filled with the smell of rotten eggs.\nWhat a visitation!\" Geoffrey exclaimed turning up his nose.\nGracie's eyes widened in alarm as a twisted face poked through the floor, its skin pale and drawn across a head too heavy for its skinny neck. The ghoul moved slowly as if it had no bones at all, slinking and oozing until it crouched awkwardly beside a bookcase. It studied Olivia with hollow eyes, before groaning through broken teeth.\nThere was stillness on both sides, then sudden movement with force in every blow.\n\"Try the iron!\" Geoffrey yelled.\n\"It's in the kitchen\" Olivia screamed.\n\"What good is an iron?\" Charlotte swung the cushion violently at the ghoul.\nGeoffrey's confusion was apparent as Alistair appeared in the doorway surrounded by spectral figures.\n\"I'll bless some water.\" Geoffrey sounded helpful.\n\"Why don't you try some salt whilst you're at it, it works on every slug!\" Olivia snapped.\nDavid lunged towards a cabinet pulling open the doors. He scanned the shelves for the secret tipple and spotted a bottle of tonic water.\n\"That'll do.\" he muttered before spinning round open mouthed. \"I've got some water!\" he cried tossing the bottle to Geoffrey.\nThe room was alive with floating objects filing through the door. Amidst the chaos Iris floated sideways as a heavy book fell from the ceiling. The book narrowly missed Olivia as she frantically reached for the poker in the fireplace.\n\"Here!\" Iris flicked her wrist and the poker lifted into the air, hovering above David's head.\n\"Now what?\" Olivia watched as a confused array of books, shoes and saucepans danced across the ceiling.\nGeoffrey's words packed a powerful punch. A sudden gust of wind threw the Bellamys to the floor.\nThey cowered as the ghoulish freaks were jettisoned through the walls, their hysterical cries lost in the sound of the wind. The force of the gust pushed Alistair forward, propelling him towards the window.\nHe passed through the glass in a scream of protest and disappeared in a smokey haze.\nIris was pinned to the wall, her body half in and half out of the manor with her hands and feet sticking out like knobbled coat hangers.\n\"What a disappointment!\" she gasped \"I'm stuck again.\"\nThe winter mist hung heavy as the Bellamy's walked through the lych gate of St. Martin's church.\nA small crowd had gathered inside the church, and there was an air of expectation as the family joined them inside.\nOlivia flashed a satisfied smile at the congregation.\nThe manor had slipped into tranquillity and its dusty rooms opened out to welcome a new generation of visitors. The unruly inhabitants had gone, and one by one they rose to the sky in a flurry of stars and light. The gruesome spirits were nowhere to be seen, and the family breathed a sigh of relief as the Christmas festivities began.\nOlivia had set the table for lunch and with the Christmas goose slowly roasting in the oven, the family had set out for morning mass.\nGeoffrey Symington was relaxed as he took the first reading. It had been a peculiar month.\nThe blessing for rescued pets at the Church of Our Lady and the prayer for the dysfunctional goat had sprung out of nowhere; he had no idea how to address an issue with a goat! And the exploding church candle wasn't entirely welcomed either.\nThe pinnacle of success was the matter regarding the manor.\nHe hadn't received a calling like that for decades; he'd never known such a stubborn mob.\nGeoffrey was looking forward to lunch; he was partial to a bit of goose. He hoped Olivia had a decent Christmas pudding too, not too much brandy but a nice bit of rum. He wasn't keen on nuts either; perhaps she made them without walnuts.\nHis mouth began to water and he swallowed noisily into the microphone.\nHis eyes scanned the congregation in the nave. Eager faces beamed up at him from wooden pews decorated with fresh greenery, and the flickering candle danced across the edges of the advent wreath in front of the pulpit.\nThe women's institute had done an excellent job.\nFresh greenery hung on every door, and pine boughs decorated the altar and window ledges. Candles and bright red poinsettias were dotted about the nave on tables, and a wooden nativity scene welcomed visitors.\nThe aroma of fresh pine and candlewax drifted on a gentle breeze as the heavy oak church door closed on the last arrivals. Geoffrey smiled in acknowledgement and continued with a prayer.\nThe service soon progressed to lively carolling with Ding Dong Merrily on High resounding against the stone walls, followed by The First Noel.\nAt twelve thirty, Geoffrey pulled Lizzie to a halt outside the manor.\nThe door opened to the aroma of orange and cinnamon, and the house sparkled from every corner.\nThe creaking door closed with a flourish as he stepped into the hallway.\nThe family portraits twinkled above the open fire and the polished floor gleamed beneath the tree by the window. Huge garlands hung from the staircase and a glistening chandelier threw shafts of delicate light across the walls.\nThe trick of the light seemed to reflect tiny faces in the baubles on the Christmas tree, but the idea of unwanted visitors was soon dismissed as he was shown into the dining room.\nRuskington Manor was dressed in winter white and silver with splashes of bright red and fresh foliage from the garden. The light through the windows hit the room at every angle and the glowing fire crackled merrily as David piled on extra logs.\nThe Bellamy's had already opened their presents and Gracie was setting up the new Echo whilst Charlotte shouted instructions at the speaker.\nEmpty boxes and discarded wrapping had been hastily removed leaving a small selection of tree presents. Amongst them was a very special gift for the vicar, an antique frame which David had found in a local shop. The neatly wrapped parcel lay undisturbed between two large baubles, hidden from inquisitive hands.\nOlivia's perfect Christmas had been meticulously planned.\nThe rooms were dressed, the table laid, the gifts were flawless and dinner was a complete triumph.\nNo uninvited guests, no inhospitable hosts, the manor was theirs.\nShe watched as Geoffrey chewed every appreciative mouthful.\nThe girls helped themselves to more goose and Charlotte had an extra portion of roasted vegetables.\nThe manor had been a haven of peace since Geoffrey's visit.\nNo strange noises or bumps in the night, no moving objects, no ugly little freaks.\nAnd no Aunt Iris, Olivia's prayers had been answered the night they met in a blizzard.\nThe gift was perfect, Geoffrey collected frames and it was ideal for the watercolour he had in his study.\nIt had been a peculiar year for everyone. Geoffrey's calling had been a strange but unexpected pleasure. He certainly hadn't lost his spiritual touch and a tiny bit of magic wouldn't harm anyone.\nHis mind drifted to the forgotten Christmas at the manor when the Dukes footman stumbled across a secret.\nGeoffrey had been a young man the day he walked up the drive, and somehow the past had called him back to the place where it all began. He sipped at a glass of port and took a bite of the Christmas pudding. Olivia had triumphed, with lunch at least, and he sincerely hoped that the secret would remain as it was for everyone's sake.\nDavid pulled the bolt across the door and turned the key.\nChristmas had always been his favourite time of the year and he was filled with boyish excitement as soon as the mince pies hit the shelves in the supermarkets. By the time the baubles were out he was swept up in the festivities long before the big day. Their friendship with Geoffrey couldn't have come at a better time.\nSometimes life gets in the way and not every Christmas is the ideal Christmas, but there's something about a late winters day when you're decorating the tree and drinking hot chocolate that creates the perfect end to the day. And when the snow silently falls, the magic really begins.\nGathering round the tree on Christmas morning whilst the fire crackles in the fireplace, opening presents and burying the floor waist deep in wrapping paper is what Christmas all about, giving.\nUpstairs, Gracie and Charlotte lay snuggled against the cold under heavy duvets.\nLulled into sleep by full stomachs and warm fires, the girls barely moved as their father walked along the hallway to the master bedroom.\nOlivia was in the kitchen, checking all was in order for Boxing Day.\nThe day had been perfect, prefect presents, a perfect table and the perfect guest loved his perfect gift.\nShe took a last look around the kitchen before walking towards the stairs.\nThe manor was beautiful in the snow.\nThe twinkling lights turned it in to a magical wonderland instead of a stark, desolate building.\nA flick of a switch threw the hall into darkness, with a dying flame from the fire the only source of light.\nOlivia climbed the stairs to the bedrooms above.\nThe stairs turned at the second flight and as she placed her foot on the lower step, a door slammed somewhere near the music room.\nOlivia's eyes opened in alarm and she held her breath as the sound of footsteps echoed down below.\nShe gasped in horror as she realised they were back."

I almost touched the dust on the reference desk\u2019s broad top, curious to wipe away the grime and see the grain of the old wood. Real wood. None of the synthetic substitute used nowadays to simulate the nostalgic glory of times past.\nI pulled out a crumpled scrap of paper with a single word scribbled in the center. I didn\u2019t recall writing the note, or putting it in my pocket, but the word was underlined. It had to be important. \u201cCrystal.\u201d My too-loud voice echoed in the vast building.\nShe floated over the hardwood floor, her legs fading into nonexistence before they reached the ground. A thin haze followed her. I stayed well back and when she stopped in front of a row of card catalogs, the haze slid forward to reincorporate with the rest of her.\nI went up on tiptoes and peered over the edge, wondering if I was simply at the wrong angle to see what was inside, but all that met my eyes was the bottom of the drawer.\nThe ghost led me up a stairway to a broad mezzanine looking down on the ground floor. Tall windows lined the walls, looking out into heavy fog, its damp grayness beading on the glass. I tried to remember what was outside. Trees? Houses? Skyscrapers?\nI hadn\u2019t realized I\u2019d stopped walking. I scurried to catch up.\nThe space between the bookshelves was narrow enough that I would have to back out in order for her to pass me, but before I could move, the ghost slid through my body in a wave of glacial cold laced with the smell of musty paper and book glue. I closed my eyes, waiting for it to be over.\nWhen I could feel my insides again, I reopened my eyes. The once-dim library gleamed. Sunlight streamed through the windows. Books filled the shelves, not a trace of dust or a single cobweb in sight.\nI spun to see the librarian\u2019s silver-laced bun vanish down the stairs to the ground floor.\nThis wasn\u2019t possible. But, then, being in a library at all wasn\u2019t possible. They\u2019d been torn apart for scrap long ago, the marble, hardwood, and glass repurposed in the new world.\nI pulled the nearest title into my hands and opened it, the slick dust-jacket smooth under my fingers. With no idea what I was looking for, I flipped through the pages, but found nothing that called to me. I put the volume back and picked up the next.\nBook after book I searched until I reached a title that caught my eye. Crystal: Anchor and Key. Eagerly, I picked it up and opened the cover, revealing a small, velvet-lined compartment containing a long, thin crystal the color of the sky.\nRecognition kicked me in the chest. I\u2019d seen this, somewhere before. Somewhere I couldn\u2019t quite remember. Somewhere I should be.\nI pulled out the crystal and cradled it against me, my heart racing.\nA cool, damp feeling, like a pale echo of the ghost\u2019s touch, saturated me and then I was falling. I closed my eyes.\nI\u2019m lying supine, a familiar face hovering over me. My sister, Maryn. Tears dampen her cheeks beneath her red-rimmed eyes.\nYes. I remember now. We\u2019d been exploring at the edge of the city. I\u2019d toppled. Fallen through the Boundary . . .\nI touch the necklace at my throat\u2014the thin, blue crystal she\u2019d given me for my fifteenth birthday. The anchor that bound me to this place. The key that brought me home.\nShe leads me away from the thick fog that marks the Boundary. The same fog that had beaded on the library\u2019s windows. Had it been real? Or nothing more than illusion?\nThe wind blows, dissipating the last ghostly scent of lemon wax and book glue. The City\u2019s odorless sterility feels wrong. Like it is the real illusion.\nBut Maryn\u2019s hand in my own is warm. Alive.\nRebecca Birch is a science fiction and fantasy writer based in Seattle, Washington. She\u2019s a classically trained soprano, holds a deputy black belt in Tae Kwon Do, and enjoys spending time in the company of trees.

Her short story collection, Life Out of Harmony and Other Tales of Wonder, was released in June 2017. You can find her online at wordsofbirch.com or on twitter as @wordsofbirch.\nI must admit to having a soft spot for libraries. My local branch when I was a child was a grand old building with wooden pillars, marble details, floors that weren\u2019t quite level, and a certain smell that has never quite left my mind.\nWhile I still love libraries, the places I go to now are much newer. Shinier. Sanitized. The sense of character that pervaded the old library is missing. It\u2019s that change\u2014that sense of nostalgia\u2014that was the genesis for Anchor and Key.\nI wanted to take some time to relive those memories, and to consider what changes may yet come in the future. How much farther will technology and development bring us from those old card catalogs, hand-stamps for due dates, and book glue?\nAnchor and Key is the result. I hope that you enjoyed the glimpse into a remembered past and a possible future yet to come.\nI don\u2019t normally read ghost stories, but \u2013 with a love of libraries \u2013 this one appealed to me. Libraries are, inexplicably, tied in with old, comforting memories of a warm,musty shed, paraffin and peeling, broken deckchairs,the potent aroma of paint, Daddy long-legs, and \u2018forever\u2019 days spent wandering in my paternal grandma\u2019s garden. (I used to read her wonderful encyclopedias on a rug in the garden\u2019s air-raid shelter, so that\u2019s possibly the link!) Very well written and evocative.\nThe story conjures up a good haunting atmosphere and the ghost is well depicted. I just wish it was longer!"

It puts me over the top. The older the book, well, the weaker I get in the knees. My shelves are heavy with 18th and 19th century publications, and whenever I\u2019m so inclined, I pull a book off the shelf and read a chapter or two on England\u2019s early efforts in colonial Asia or a verse or two from Shakespeare or Donne or Pope, and in doing so, I am transported back in time, my senses of sight, touch, and smell and a fertile imagination taking me there.\nThere are two other products that make me swoon similarly: old sailboats out on the sea, and Apple hardware. While a wooden boat at sea affects perceptions in the same way, the MacBook Air, iPad, and iPhone lack the intoxicating aromas of old books and boats, their fragrances more RAMish, electrical and modern.\nSo what an absolute treat it is that with TwelveSouth\u2019s BookBook line of products, I can add the smell of leather and the notion of antiquity to my MacBook and iOS products and safely disguise them somewhere on my bookshelves.\nI\u2019ve ordered both the BookBook for iPhone and for the MacBook Air (they will arrive shortly,) and already have one for the iPad. If you like the smell of leather and are attracted to old books, get one. They really are very good products, and make excellent disguises."

And probably other people\u2019s too.\nThe way books smell matters. The cheap hard white academic institutional paper of tenure books and reheated dissertations has a smell that tells you from the beginning that you will learn a firehose-blast of trivialities and you will not admit to enjoying it too much. My undated Hodder & Stoughton edition of The Ruba\u2019iya\u2019t of Omar Khayyam has just a memory of a smell of storytime from thick soft volumes, while my copy of Elementary Particles by David Griffiths has an inexplicable faint whiff of black pepper. For a long time, every issue of National Geographic had a tangy smart pong that was the closest thing I\u2019d ever found to the taste left by a large bug (perhaps a bee) that slammed into the back of my mouth as I was cycling at speed. And nothing \u2013 nuh, thing \u2013 can match the overriding dusty-honey air of ancient foxed linen rag bond in the subterranean stacks of that Great Pyramid of theatre history, that glorious bibliotechnical Dumpster, the Harvard Theatre Collection.\nBut Canada is a mostly dry-air place, especially in winter. Books don\u2019t always build as rich a smell here as they can in other lands. And so it was with pleasure that I opened a copy of Slanguage: A Dictionary of Irish Slang, sent to me by Stan Carey, a very fine man who lives in Galway, which is by the ocean on the shredded west edge of Ireland, and discovered that it has more to offer the nose than the Irish whiskey in my glass.\nOf course the book has myriads of fine words, and I will get to know many of them. But before I can read them, I have to open it, and at that moment it offers to my nose the air of where it had spent the past few years. It is remarkable. It is not the fungus, humus, and mildew of a basement in Boston or Buffalo (familiar to me, to be sure) but a kind of smell that if it were a person would have a grey beard and long staff but a twinkling eye. It calls to mind a Cuban seaside hotel room, a Caribbean textile, a faint scent of betel nut candy, and \u2013 I think \u2013 a basement room I woke up in sometime in my childhood when we would take car trips all over the continent and stay in the homes of old friends of my parents first and last known to me in the span of a dozen hours. As I flip through this copy of Slanguage I get from the page gutters hints of iodine and maybe the rough wounded hand that had the iodine applied to it. I am inclined to think there must be a must of a bog or something of that order; Galway is a place of rocks and bogs and moss.\nIt\u2019s not an old book, and it\u2019s not a warped or worn one either. The publication info says it was printed in 2005. It also says it was printed in Malaysia. I haven\u2019t been to Malaysia yet, so I don\u2019t know if it has a smell of its birthplace.\nBut for me it has, in total, a smell as of a not-new room half into the ground that I awake in as the dawn slips through the flimsy blue curtains, and I turn my head on a pillow and roll my body in sheets I have not touched before last night and will not touch again in this life, in a town that I had never met before the day before, and I see the small shaggy rug on the slightly sweaty tile floor and I smell the dank that reminds me there is mycology in paradise too, and I can look forward to a breakfast with one more set of fresh almost-strangers, people like books I read the dust cover of once.\nBut this book, its smell notwithstanding, is likely to be more like an old friend, returned to again and again to see a new leaf and another until I know some pages too well.\nThis entry was posted in fun and tagged book sniffing note, Slanguage. Bookmark the permalink.\nExcellent! \u201cWhat oft was thought, but ne\u2019er so well express\u2019d.\u201d By me, anyway, though I\u2019ve been consciously sniffing books for decades.\nThanks! Smell is really the top reason I prefer print to ebook.\nIt was, indeed, a relief to read this. I thought I was a little odd in my penchant for liking to breathe in the unique aroma of each book I read.\nThanks, James, I feel much better now!\nI thoroughly enjoyed this post!\nAre you part Bloodhound? You\u2019d give my 2yr old pet a run for her money. With a nose like yours, you should lend it to the wine or chocolate industry. Can\u2019t get what you described from a Kindle.\nReblogged this on Vijayagiri views.\nWhat a lovely smell journey! This inspires me to pull some books long-forgotten off my shelf and give them a good sniff, to bring back the nostalgia of reading them for the first time. I tend to check out books from my library nowadays, and there\u2019s a bit of reluctance there to sniff them, as they\u2019re handled by numerous strangers who have also breathed directly onto the pages. But then I recall that a majority of my books have come from second-hand stores and they too are just as musty from other\u2019s breath.\nSo agree, like the warm slightly musty smell of old books and the ones like vanilla ice-cream.\nThanks. Makes me feel better to know I am not the only one who likes to smell a book. The smell is as important as the weight and feel of it.\nI used to smell books. Now, I don\u2019t do it, probably because I am trying the smell the world that the books describe more ( i read a lot of fiction ).\nBut I get it. Book smell matters and I absolutely how you were able to categorize books by their smells. I kind of envy your nose.\nReading is fun. But not sniffing the dust of ages on the shelves. Not if you\u2019re alergic!\nAhh, I can\u2019t read a book without sniffing it first. You\u2019ve caught me!\nI\u2019ve done this ever since I could remember and I\u2019ve been judged because of it lol, never to harsh of course but boy am I glad I\u2019m not alone !!\nI\u2019d like to think that there\u2019s a special connection we all have to those powerful smells. I know there are less of us simply because people like their screens now, but I still love the intoxication of opening an old book.\nBooks are like wine the older they are the better they smell. I have the poems of Elizabeth Barrent Browning dated 1844. It has a sweet musk scent to it.\nReblogged this on Project Management Research Institute.\nI thought only I like the smell of new books :-). Great to know that there many like me.\nNothing like a book in hand!\nReally wish I had some time to read again!\nGreat article, good read, you got my eye when I saw the title.My daughter loves the smell of new books. Like my daughter you\u2019re all weirdos in a good way. I personally see it as just dust. I\u2019ll go over to rose and sniff her petals of the grandest of all smells.\nSo true! A bad smelling book makes for a bad read!\nI like the smell of old books ..it gets to me in a good way!\nSome of my favorite reads were mass-market paperbacks that were printed 20+ years ago. These books tend to have just the right level of mustiness.\nI love the smell of books too. The aroma was one of my favourite aspects of visiting book shops!\nI\u2019ve loved the smell books old and new since I was a kid. I also used to love the smell of new cassette tapes.\nAnd don\u2019t second hand bookshops have the most amazing wafts! Yes the smell of books matter \u2013 my phone screen just doesn\u2019t hold up!\nSniffing books is one of my secret pleasures. Thank you for making me feel not so lonely.\nWow, talk about visual descriptions! As a beginning writer, I am in awe! Your writing makes me feel like I am there, experiencing your adventures and love for words intrinsically. Keep cooking your verbal concoctions!\nLoved it! Actually mentioned this weird habit in one of my posts!\nBook sniffing is a thing. It\u2019s the first thing I do whenever I receive a new book or go to the bookshop or library, but you have such a beautiful way of writing it!\nThe smell of old books is the best! Maybe that\u2019s why I like going to the library so much."

The dog simply stinks.\nWe opened a two week old container of blue cheese\u2014who can tell when it goes bad?\u2014and I said to Alex, \u201cWhoa, that smells like Lizzie dog!\u201d I was back in Montana being attacked by morning-dog Lizzie while Gus-the-Ewok-Airedale groaned and rolled over in his bed.\nSmells evoke feelings and memories. Isn\u2019t that something?\nIn the same way that our favorite songs from our teen years can zap us back to that dance with that boy/girl friend, smells can instantaneously transport us. Anytime I hear any song from Billy Joel\u2019s The Stranger, I am back at York College of Pennsylvania singing every lyric and wishing for a romantic dinner at an Italian Restaurant.\nWe were walking through Bloomfield, Pittsburgh\u2019s own Little Italy, last weekend and I stopped in the middle of the sidewalk, \u201cWhat\u2019s that smell? It\u2019s nudging at a memory.\u201d But we couldn\u2019t identify anything nearby that matched the aroma. I always want to call elusive foliage Honeysuckle or Bougainvillea, because I like saying both those words, but I couldn\u2019t match the memory to the flowers on hand.\nSpeaking of blooms, mention Wisteria to me and I know exactly which folder in my cast of hundreds to find the picture of the Wisteria draping elegantly over a wall as Jackie and I hiked into Corniglia in the Cinque Terre. Years later, hiking there again, I looked for and spotted that very same wrought iron gate and dangling flowers.\nPulling a clothing storage box out of the closet, I flipped the lid open. Immediately, I\u2019m assaulted with a Dad-fragrance. There is a pillow kept there that he laid his head on while in his power chair, battling ALS. It\u2019s not that Dad-whiff of lingering cigarettes that somehow never bothered me, it\u2019s more ethereal than that\u2014a smell that told me I was home.\nOak leaves dried to a crisp crunchiness in a hot autumn sun will always take me back to our childhood and raking them in the front yard. They had fallen from a massive tree that took six cousins, arms linked, to embrace in a hug. Random autumns since I\u2019ve been back in Pennsylvania, I press colorful Maple leaves and send them to a friend in Montana who grew up in Minnesota so the colors and any residue smell can transport her home. To Jackie, I gather acorns\u2014they must have their \u201chats\u201d attached\u2014and cracking one open reminds her of riding over them with her bicycle and the scent of the nut meat.\nWalking down an unpaved Montana road on a hot summer day, Jackie catches an aroma akin to raspberries. It elicits the thought of Mom\u2019s sewing machine\u2014was it the Singer oil from her 1950s model?\nA cousin opens a door to a long-closed room and inside is a stack of books, dust-laden covers somewhat obscured. Instant regression to her Grandma\u2019s attic and playing there as a child.\nLilacs summon smiles for many people.\nAs children, Jackie and I couldn\u2019t wait to cut lilacs from Grandma\u2019s bushes and put them in a vase in Mom\u2019s kitchen. Soon the fragrance would overwhelm the house. For cousin, her grandmother had a light purple bush large enough that a mischievous child could hide in the middle of it and being surrounded by the smell of lilacs was heaven. Her grandma stored the clothesline poles in there. With any luck, drying sheets could get wrapped around the poles and that night when you crawled into bed, the light perfume of lilacs was with you.\nTeaberry Gum\u2014have you ever had it? For a long time we couldn\u2019t find it in Montana. Mom used to send it to us. Opening the box, that first inhalation of it and we zoomed straight back to childhood, to the local gas station, to picking out one candy to take home.\nOld Spice cologne. I know that young men wear it, but for us it is the defining scent of our father. I smell it now and there I am, sitting on the side of the bath tub, watching my dad shave. The ritual, the preciseness, the light splash of Old Spice at the end.\nThere is an abundance of information on scent-memory correlation. I read about the science of it before starting this article. But really, I don\u2019t need to know the how or the why of odors sending us back in time. I am simply thankful, counting my blessings that I have these memories embedded in my brain. I vow to pay closer attention and when an odor wafts my way and strikes a cord, I\u2019m going to stop, breath it in, and relive every detail of the moment and memory it takes me to.\nAny scents that bring back good thoughts and happy times?\nNextWhich Ghoul Do You Prefer?\nThe smell of sulfur will conjure Yellowstone for me in a heartbeat.

                            "text": "Basements are notorious for developing musty smells. This is a guide about getting rid of a musty smell in the basement.\nMy 1950s era basement has such a strong musty smell that it can be noticed on the first floor. The house has a waterproofing system on the walls and floor, and there is no moisture anywhere that is visible. The dehumidifier runs 24/7 on high. There are 2 floor drains, one used by the dehumidifier and a sump pump. Help! I can't stand the smell in my kitchen, which wafts up from the basement.\nI have been successful at getting rid of musty odors by setting out bowls of straight white vinegar in such an area. had a friend who lived in the basement area of a very old house. he used the vinegar and it worked for him. took a few days. and to keep the odor away, the vinegar needs to be replaced as needed. also increase the fresh air intake.\nHow do I control musty odor in and old cellar?\nEditor's Note: To clarify, use plain barbecue charcoal, NOT the easy light kind with the lighter fluid in them.\nYou need a dehumidifier to take the moisture out of the air. After a few days you will be amazed at the difference.\nIf you have a cellar door make sure the screen is in & also have a screen made for any small cellar windows. Between the cellar door screen & the window screen you should receive some type of cross breeze thereby eliminating the musty smell. Plus a dehumidifier absolutely also helps. Good luck.\nMy aunt's basement has a very strong musty smell that is in the walls as well as the ceiling and beams. Is there anything that can be painted or sprayed on all the surfaces before regular painting so the smell is entirely covered?\nIf it's possible open the windows in the basement to ventilate it so fresh air comes in. If you are going to do the job of taking care of the musty smell in the basement, make sure that you wear a face mask before you tackle a cleaning job. Use a mixture of bleach and water and scrub the walls. The bleach and water combination will get rid of the musty smell and mold. I don't know what can be done with the ceiling. What your aunt's basement needs is a dehumidifier which will remove the dampness.\nMaybe others will post some of their ideas.\nI agree with the idea of using bleach, but also trying using the product KILZ. It's a primer you use before painting. In my experience, it gets rid of odor and if your going from a darker color to lighter, it works great. Hope this helps.\nHow do you get rid of a musty smell in the basement?\nTo rid the basement of musty smells use regular charcoal bricks. The kind used for grilling out.\nDo not use the ones with lighter fluid added to them. Place several bricks inb a pie tin and place around your basement. Hope this helps.\nHow do I get rid of a musty smell in the basement?\nA musty smell usually comes from mold or dirt. Try running a dehumidifier to see if it improves. My daughter's allergist tells her a clean house doesn't smell. I hope this helps you. I have that smell in my basement, too.\nVinegar will take care of mustiness and molds, but it's a bit of a challenge to wash a whole basement with it. Maybe a spray bottle, and set pans of it out. Definitely the dehumidifier though, otherwise the vinegar won't be able to keep up.\nOur basement is musty; I clean it often, but am not doing what needs to be done. What can we do to remove odor?\nIf your basement floor has vinyl flooring or linoleum or anything that is non breathable check underneath for water and mould. A concrete floor must be able to breath or you will get mould and a musty smell.\nI have a walk-out cellar w/2 windows and a patio door. The windows are open all the time and I still get that smell. I purchased a dehumidifier. I ran it for a week straight which helped with the smell but almost doubled my light bill. Would a ceiling fan help? The walls are dry walled and it's all open. It's the game room and doubles as a spare bedroom.\nA dehumidifier should not have that effect on your electric bill. If you ran it, windows are open and you still have that smell, then somehow water is getting in. Do you have a leak coming from any pipes, hotwater heater, furnace??? Are your walls leaking in water from the outside? Yes a ceiling fan would also help, but the best thing would be to find a source of where the moisture is coming from.\nYes, a dehumididifer runs your electric up BIG time . I have a brand new one in my basement and used it one year. I don't use it anymore because I can't afford the double bill.\nMy dehumidifier upped my bill $58.00 a month!!!!!!!!!!\nMy basement is 90% finished, but I still get a musty smell in it. How can I get rid of it without spending a lot of money?\nI would suggest a dehumidifier. Do you have any windows you could open as well?\nOur walk out basement has a cellar smell. The floor is fully carpeted over cement and has been there for about 25 years. The cellar smell/concrete smell appeared about 2 years ago. How do we get rid of this musty concrete/cellar smell?\nMoisture is getting in some where to cause the smell. You are going to have to find the source and repair it. Look for places where the concrete or carpet may be damp. Check around the windows and door and foundation. Until you find it, put in a dehumidifier.\nThere is a strong musty smell in my above ground and totally finished basement or lower level.\nThe basement in our cottage became musty 2 summers ago when we were not available to dump the dehumidifier. Prior to that it was fresh and dry. There are no visible signs of mold or mildew. It is mostly painted cinder block with a painted floor covered with carpet remnants. We know that it needs be removed.\nThe well is in the basement and you can see the sand around it so moisture will be an ongoing issue if the dehumidifier is not emptied regularly. What can we use or do to clean it and remove the musty smell?\nWe had that problem too. I bought several large bags of charcoal (the kind used for grilling), opened them and placed them around the basement in different areas. The charcoal absorbs the odors and some of the dampness that causes the odor. I hope this helps.\nI have a very musty smelly basement. I may have someone staying with us who could live down there. Besides a dehumidifier or those retail water absorbers that you buy what can I do about the odor? Any tried and true secrets for the basement?\nIf you like the smell of olives, then dust the basement area with olive leaf powder. Not only will OLP eliminate the musty smell, it will also keep any mold from forming. Use of a dehumidifier, along with the dusting of olive leaf powder, will do it. Peace and blessings.\nI have used Odo Ban in a spray which I have purchased from Walmart and it says it is pet friendly. Nice scent. I have used Simple Green as well which is nontoxic. With both I spray carpet and wipe down stuff.\nI have also used white vinegar left in bowls around the room. Spritzed the carpet as well. Takes longer for the vinegar scent to disappear, but it is a disinfectant and mold killer as well.\nLavender essential oil is another good disinfectant. Mix about 8 drops with water in a spray bottle and have at it.\nCould anyone tell me how to get a musty smell out of the basement? I run a dehumidifier daily and I have tried vinegar, baking soda and Lysol but it still smells."

The room was so perfectly quiet that each soft foot step, foot arched and calves tense under the effort to meld perfectly into the night, reverberated through the hallway of this Victorian home. Off-white walls covered with shadows cast by the distant street lamps, yellowed by the years yet alive again as her shape danced upon its surface. One slow step after another. Despite the echo of her footsteps, she continued at the same pace, almost in a trance on her way through a home that used to be all hers.\nThe ball of her foot slipped into a softness, her body sliding backwards into a warmth that seemed inexplicably tight, drifting up her body as if a sleeping bag had been slipped around her. Tighter and tighter, the warmth enveloped her as she slide into some other world where a soft music played in the background. The warmth dissipated and was replaced with a fear. The world was squeezing her too tightly. She tried to scream but no sound arose from her throat, the tightness gripped around her neck, made breathing difficult and now the warmth running her was red-hot panic. She tried gasping. She tried to pull her arms up to pry off this invisible force but could see nothing beyond her blinded eyelids. The music got louder. The notes became staccato. It rose and fell with the beat of her heart, ever faster.\nAnd then, suddenly, she was walking again.\nShe was back on her tip-toes, ballerina perfectly poised. The muscles remembered all that she had learned in her youth. Shoulders back. Stomach tensed towards her spine. Bottom tucked under. Arms sweeping from her sides to curve high above her head. The ground was no longer the floors of the place she'd once called home. Instead it was thick, hard, a soft texture that called her to reach out and touch it. As she lifted her heels higher and tensed her calves to spin, letters ran like ribbon around her midriff. She spun and spun, surrounded by this whisking ribbons of words. Jumbled, non-sensical, running over her as if water, never sticking, never quite tangible but creating a soft wind against her, slipping against the smooth fabric of her navy blue, almost purple leotard. Bringing her arms out in line with her shoulders, she could feel the texture of the arching floor. Her feet in a crevasse, the V-shape of her surrounds fluttering in the wind. She could hold on to these walls. These pages to which the letters belonged.\nThe story of her life whipping around her in a growing wind, the panic of the music getting louder and louder and yet she became one with it all. She was the words. She was the yellowed paper of these pages. She was the spinning ballerina, spinning like a top, losing momentum as the world around her became faster and faster.\nThrough the darkness, the book slamming shut around her, the musty smell of an ancient text overwhelming her sensation of the world disappearing under her. Clawing upwards for the ribbons of letters, becoming aware of a wind rushing past her as she fell faster and faster.\nAs she fell, the years slipped off her skin. She began disappearing. She became the darkness. Silence and the night intertwined around her.\nAnd then there was nothing but memories."

Shaking her hips and jigging her arms around in excitement, she lowers herself onto her belly and slithers like a snake upon the wet leaves beneath the trees that hitch up their branches for her like a dress, and when she passes through, nature takes her back into its womb. As she slips and slides into the darkness drunkenly chattering her teeth, the animals move alongside her, and when they reach out their paws and beaks, their tiny animal hearts see inside her mind, and what they see is a woman made of so many memories tasting of so many things yet never of what she\u2019s been searching for more than anything. Kicking her legs, she claws her way through the rabbit hole. Seconds become years, and years become vague ideas not real at all but like the images of a movie played out in a weary mind seven sheets to the lingering breeze. The past is gone, and yet the scars remain. Like ink on skin, they colour her with love and they colour her with shame. They flower the way a dead star flowers beneath the watchful eye of God, and what God sees is what God wants. His own invention with a mind of its own, flirting with sin and greedy for the pleasures that stir within. Puffing out her cheeks, she wiggles her fingers and toes, and as the eyes of the animals widen at the sight of what comes next, she hisses her tongue and bites the inside of her mouth as somewhere ahead a voice calls to her promising the taste of that one true kiss. Kicking her legs, she swims like a dolphin, so perfect and shiny and at one with all things.\nOh! I love this! It\u2019s really quite perfect.\nShe\u2019ll find it I\u2019m sure. She\u2019s got the magic to open any door she wants.\nWow\u2026.I love this piece of yours. It\u2019s so beautiful.

Why had she never noticed the almost incessant groans the house emitted?\nBecause she wasn\u2019t used to being there alone. Six others worked with her, and the office was usually filled with activity\u2014the shuffling of papers, the click of computer keys, brief conversations at the water cooler.\nNow she\u2019d gotten herself spooked. For no reason other than that she had an overactive imagination. No one was upstairs. She\u2019d have known if someone had kicked in the door or broken a window. Besides, what she\u2019d heard wasn\u2019t footsteps. More like faint crackling and creaking.\nShe fished her cell phone from her purse and crept toward the stairs, ready to dial 911 if needed. An odor wafted to her, faint, then growing stronger\u2014pungent, hot, smoky.\nShe raced up the steps two at a time and flung open the door. Thick gray smoke rolled past her down the hall. She clasped a hand over her mouth and nose and ran into the open living room and dining area.\nFlames licked at the partitions dividing the perimeter into four work areas. The entire entry was ablaze, the fire sweeping across the floor. She\u2019d escape out the back, then call for help.\nAs she passed the kitchen, her heart stuttered. It was even worse there. Flames engulfed all the cabinets and were working their way up the walls. Smoke curled toward her, stinging her eyes.\nShe turned the dead bolt and flung open the door. It moved about two inches and jerked to a stop. Her heart slammed against her rib cage in an erratic rhythm. Someone had trapped her inside.\nShe tried to tamp down her panic. The building had probably shifted, binding the door. She just needed to force it open. She stepped back and threw her weight against it. It didn\u2019t move. Something seemed to be holding it closed from the outside.\nPanic flared anew. Her lungs burned, and her body screamed for oxygen. Unable to hold her breath any longer, she grabbed a fistful of her shirt and pressed it to her face.\nWhen she drew in a gulp of air, her throat closed by reflex, and a coughing fit drove her to her knees. With shaking hands, she dialed 911. When the dispatcher answered, all she could manage was a raspy croak and more coughing.\nAfter dropping the phone, she rose, stumbled to the nearest window and flipped the locks into the open position. It wouldn\u2019t budge. The wooden window frame had been sealed permanently shut by decades of painting and repainting. Two others were the same way.\nIn a last desperate attempt to escape, she picked up a chair and slammed it against the window. She\u2019d have to break more than just glass. The wood that separated the six-by-nine panes would have to be destroyed before she could climb to safety.\nGlass shattered and wood splintered. Each effort brought on more coughing. Darkness encroached on her vision.\nThe sirens were closer. But not close enough.\nShe fell to her knees. Ivan. He\u2019d warned her. If he couldn\u2019t have her, he\u2019d make sure no one else could, either. The restraining order meant nothing. God, please help me.\nThe sirens had died away. A few feet away, the back door swung open, and a flashlight beam swept through the smoke.\n\u201cOver here.\u201d Had the words made it past her lips? She tried again and more coughing overtook her. The flashlight was closer now.\nShe stretched out a hand. A gloved one grasped it, and a fireman dropped to his knees beside her. Strong arms slid beneath her and lifted. She squinted, trying to see the face behind the plastic shield. But the darkness encroached further."

                            "text": "The snow crunches beneath her paws as she laboriously pushes forward in the storm. Forest trees surround her in the dark, her silver fur glints under the crescent moon, her eye sharp and gray, cunning like the edge of a blade, cruel, like the taunting glint of a diamond one cannot have. Marred flesh cover the spot where her other eye used to be, a reminder of the past that never seems to go away. She is blinded by the ice cold rain, slicing into her back like a million tiny hooks piercing through her skin. She stumbles in the snow, her stick-thin limbs unable to hold her own weight, and the hooks on her back pull, yank, dragging jagged lines across her back. She focuses her eyes on the village she is heading to, pushing through the pain and fatigue and slowly, painstakingly, making her way towards the brightly glowing dot in the distance.\nShe turns to look back at where she came from, her pawprints already disappearing in the snow. Once again, she starts to doubt her decision, glancing at the empty spaces beside her. If her wolf pack were here then they would help her up when she stumbles, lend her a hand and lead her to safety. Together. If her wolf pack were here then they would help her up, only to push her back down, harder, lend her a hand with a gentle smile and lead her to the edge of a cliff. They would watch with a wicked grin as she topples over, plummeting into the welcoming arms of death, down and down until her body hits the jagged rocks below, her bones splintered, her scarlet blood splattered onto the slick rocks. And then the ocean would do its work and the waves would wash her away, cleaning up the mess, already forgotten.\nAt least this is what she would do. Push yourself up so you can push others down. Rise before they rise before you. Rise, and to rise alone. The whispers giggle in her head, tiny claws sinking into her brain, poisoning it with a shade not quite black. However, the whispers are the only voices she has heard in days, and their invisible presence is a burden that lifts her up instead of weighing her down.\nNearby, a frozen bush rustles. The white wolf swivels her head in that direction. She hears the sound of snow crunching under paw or feet, and the soft, panicked breaths from her victim\u2026or are there more than one? Her sharp gray eye twitches, and she silently stalks towards the bush. Her hind legs bend, ready for action.\nA blur of animal skin darts away from the bush. The desperation for food gives her a burst of energy, and the wolf strikes. Aiming for the neck, her sharp claws piercing through the layers of leather and into its soft skin. She realizes that it was a young girl hiding behind the bush, now skewered by her claws, her screams echoing through the dark, silent night. The girl has silver hair that shines under the moonlight, shifting like the shadows. But what surprises the white wolf the most are the angry red scars covering the skin where her left eye used to be. She looks just like me.\nThe girl\u2019s friend, the other noise from the bush, manages to get away, desperately running and screaming back towards the village, already forgetting his dying friend. This is what friends do: They leave you behind and cast you out when you need them the most, the whispers giggle excitedly, Go on, finish the job!\nThe white wolf looks into the girl\u2019s dull gray eye, already draining of life, filled with terror and stupid hope that she will live. The wolf steels her heart, flicking away the silver of vulnerability that had claimed her earlier, then sinks her fangs in the soft flesh of the girl\u2019s neck. She feels the veins and arteries burst as she bites, the sweet, warm trickle of blood running into her mouth. She can\u2019t deny the satisfaction, the delicious smell of blood in the middle of ice.\nThe white wolf watches as the girl\u2019s bright blue eyes go vacant, their luster dimmed. She could feel the girl\u2019s heartbeat slowing until there is nothing but silence in the dark night. She is once again alone. Good.\nThe white wolf then drags the body out of the woods, towards the village. Yessss, you did it. Now you can show them who is in control, the whispers say. The wolf grins, and the vengeful darkness in her heart churns, the chittering of the whispers louder, pushing her forward, as she takes step after step, each one closer to ultimate justice revenge.\nOnce upon a time, a white wolf had a family, a lover, and a pack of friends. Then they betrayed her, and she destroyed them all. The white wolf stopped before the village, let go of the body in her mouth, tilted her head back and howled, long and great and filled with hatred and fury. Now the villagers know. Know she is the enemy, the beast let out of its cage. She is the White Wolf, and she is not afraid.\nOnce upon a time, there was a little girl and a little boy who were best friends forever. The little girl once had golden hair and blue eyes before they took it from her, stole her left eye and gave her silver hair. The little boy was unmarked, smooth and beautiful and normal. They grew up together in a cozy village surrounded by the great forest in the South, and the unfathomable ocean in the North. They would always pretend to be magical hunters in the woods, running around, giggling with their sticks as swords, their stones as fireballs. On one unfortunate night, the girl and the boy were playing in the woods, but this time it was different, there was a colder chill in the air. Something was wrong. They hid behind a bush, hoping whatever it was, it would go away soon. For a second, it seems as if their hoping had worked, but then the beast strikes, sinking its claws into the girl\u2019s chest, her screams piercing through the night. The attacker was a huge white wolf with a shining silver coat and one eye, it\u2019s vicious fangs gleaming under the moonlight. Out of terror and disbelief, the little boy got up and ran, too afraid to meet his friend\u2019s dying pleading gaze. Later that night, the wolf emerged from the forest, with the dead girl with silver hair and one eye in its jaws, its eyes two veiled storms of hatred and fury. The wolf drops the girl carelessly to the ground before the village, tilts it\u2019s head up and howled, long and great and filled with hatred and fury. Now the villagers know, know the white wolf who killed the monster marked girl. Now they will build a wall around the village, to keep the monsters out, and the children in.\nThe reflection of a whole moon flickers and rolls on the glassy surface of the ocean, sifting with the gentle waves. The night is without stars, the utter blackness of night overwhelming. Dreary clouds drift lazily over the moon, leaving only the outline visible. Stray fragments of light peeking out from the clouds color the night a hazy gray. A lone wolf sits still on the rocky seashore, her glazed eye fixed on the hidden moon. Her silver coat gleams under the light, ever shifting in a million shades of gray.\nDeep inside her mind, darkness rises and pools on the clean white tiles of the floor. It is a dark liquid, not quite black, but in-between the shades of gray. The darkness slowly rises, the puddle quickly turning into a river, flooding the hallway. Rings of water expand on the surface as the whispers pound on the doors, their hushed voices taunting: Let us out! Don\u2019t let them in! The doors quiver. The whispers chitter excitedly, waiting for the moment of release. They keep going. Why do you care about them? Fool. We were here for you when they were not. We encouraged you when they pushed you down. So let us out! Let us out! The door splinters, the whispers are almost free. Their screaming overlap one another, the noise bounces off of the walls, every door in the hallway breaking, giving in to the whispers\u2019 demand.\nMeanwhile, the darkness flooding the hallway still rises, threatening to drown their screaming. The hallways are now filled with screeches, a mix of wailing and moaning and the anguished sound of suffering. The soundtrack of old memories meant buried deep in the hallways, lost with the turns and dead ends, sealed up tight with 3 doors and 13 locks, now reverberate off of the walls, roaming free in the hallways that were meant to keep them in. The whispers claw at their doors, screaming, crying, begging to come out. With a final crack, the doors burst and the whispers finally break free from their rooms, plunging into the cold darkness, free at last.\nBack on the seashore, the white wolf stays still. The waves creep slowly towards the rocky shoreline before running away, the water beating peacefully against the jagged rocks. The clouds pass over the moon, no longer obscuring it, and full moonlight shines on the water, awaking something deep inside. A low rumble shakes the shoreline, and the waves beat against the jagged rocks with crushing force, the rhythmic sound like drums of war pounding in the dead of night.\nA soft breeze shakes the white wolf\u2019s fur, and a long, low whistle travels through the wind. Voices rise from the black ocean, carried by the wind. Tears not quite black, but in-between the shades of gray, fill the white wolf\u2019s glazed eye, still fixed on the moon. Tendrils of darkness swirl inside the teardrop, and soft hisses vibrate from it. The tears drip from her snout and fall onto the rocks, bursting when they hit the ground, turning into a small puddle that has its own voice. They hiss and chitter, speaking nonsense or order, but whatever they are saying, it had caused the wolf to stir. She moves. Gets up and leaves her perch on the rocky seashore. She walks towards the ocean, closer and closer still. The voices and whispers grow louder and louder, cheering her on. Her paws touch the water. The coldness seeps into her fur, leeching onto her bones, it\u2019s small claws gripping and stabbing, never planning to let go. The white wolf steps deeper into the ocean, eye still fixed on the luminous moon. The water rises to her chest, the voices and whispers screaming for her to go on. The water rises to her snout, to her unblinking eye. She goes under. And stays. The voices and whispers stop, the waves once again gentle, the moon less bright, the air still. The night resumes back to its hazy gray.\nBut wolves can\u2019t breathe in the water.\nInside my mind, darkness rises and pools on the clean white tiles of the hallway. It is a dark liquid, not quite black, but in-between the shades of gray. It turns from a puddle into a river, chasing me as I try to escape. The darkness touches my bare foot. It is ice, cold like the whispers that haunt you in your sleep, like the monsters hiding under your bed, like the vicious darkness within that waits with open jaws to swallow you whole. The darkness rises to my ankle, my knees, my waist, my shoulders, and finally it pushes me under. I try to swim up, but already I am drowning. The walls of the hallway disappear, replaced by an infinite blackness. I realized I am in the ocean and the waves are dragging me down, and the hands of darkness are claiming me and all the life boats are deflating and all the buoys are sinking and I can\u2019t swim and I won\u2019t swim I am sinking\u2026 I am dying in the never-ending hallway of my own mind, swept up in the chaos of darkness. I will not die I will die. Because they have bound my wrists and ankles together, threw me in the ocean to drown. Because I am trapped in a rusty metal cage 204 meters down, and I can\u2019t break out. I\u2019m plummeting into a dark place, an empty world. I\u2019m a feature in the current, submerged until I\u2019m all gone.\nWhen will I be free? I often wonder this, sitting in the middle of my glass cage bubble with a porcelain mask over my face. People walk around my bubble, ignoring it because I am invisible because they have other things to attend too. Occasionally, a person or two would stop by and peer into my glass bubble, smiling or just simply curious at what is inside. But for most of the time, I am left alone with my thoughts, with the doubt and hatred creeping up, stepping out of the shadows when the sun goes down.\nWhy am I such a coward? Why can I shatter this glass cage? Why do I always live in the fear of hurting myself when I break out? That the glass will slice my skin and I will bleed and die? Because there is always a thief, a thief who will steal all the stars that light up your sky, until you are surrounded by darkness, forever alone. The whispers battle with their words, stabbing and hurting, waging war with the bit of light in my being.\nI stand up from my seat in the cage. Today is the day, where I will not back down and I will not let the whispers empower me ever again. I walk towards the glass and pound on it with all my might, each blow of my hands creating web-like cracks on the glass. It\u2019s stupid really, to think this 1 cm piece of glass is separating me from a life. I pound and scream and kick for days, until I lose track, until my throat is parched and raw, hands red and bloody, feet swollen and oozing\u2026But I will not give up; I will break free.\nAt last, the prison shatters, the glass that seemed so menacing and sharp, now a glittering confetti shower, catching the light from the setting sun. I breathe in and out, and step over the threshold.\nOutside is an unfiltered world. I don\u2019t see it through the glass, not ever again, but I see the truth. And it\u2019s breathtaking. Beautiful. I try to take another step forward, to savor the precious moments of freedom, but I can\u2019t.\nIt starts with a tingling in my heart. Then a numbing cold seizes my body, captures me in its frozen embrace. I can\u2019t move, my feet stuck on the ground just outside of my prison. My heart feels like it\u2019s turning into stone, hardening and cracking before finally splitting in half. Then sensations come flooding in. A whole river. An ocean, bursting into my body. Pain grips my throat, choking me, strangling me until I can\u2019t breathe. My body turns colder. I claw to stay in the warmth of my conscious mind, my nails digging and scratching and finding purchase, but I lose my grip and plunge into the depths of my callous heart\u2026And then a burst of a blackness so dark and vicious jolts me awake, blowing up from my chest, and into the approaching night beyond.\nIt was the darkness that saved me at the end. The darkness that is now part of the night, the shadows, the darkest corners of the universe. My mask shatters, falling from my face and breaking into a million pieces. They catch on fire as the sun disappears, the last bit of warmth fading away. I stand alone, with the shattered remains of my mask, the last embers winking out of existence. I look back at the prison that once held me in fear, now broken, the glass a harmless pile of confetti at my feet. For once maybe I am free. I am not afraid to break out of my glass prison. I am alone I am an individual. I need help to break free I am strong, and I will rise. Alone.\nSomewhere in the night, a white wolf howls, long and great and filled with joy. She is alone in the night, silver fur shifting with the shadows. She is alone, and free.\nSomewhere in the shadows, a darkness not quite black, but in-between the shades of gray, slithers down the rocky beach. Whispers call at its wake, a trail of moaning and suffering waiting to infect someone else. The darkness slithers to meets the wailing ocean, calling for its lost child. It gingerly sinks in, finally, ultimately, returning home.\nSomewhere in one of the rooms in her mind, or a rusty metal cage 204 meters down, she is continuing to fill her paper with breathings of her heart. She is still fighting the whispers coming from the other rooms, banging on the doors to be let out, still trying to swim when the hallways are flooded. She is trying to be oblivious to her peer\u2019s protests about her writing. But she is trying. Trying to not hide the scars that make her beautiful, the vicious darkness within. And sometimes, trying is all that matters in this bleak world. She could be the weak little girl with silver hair and a lost eye, or the ferocious white wolf\u2014but she still doesn\u2019t know. And perhaps that is the beauty in living a life."

Ask when they come out, and my daughters will say: when the twilight\u2019s so deep you can hardly make out individual trunks. When a fine mist rises at ground level, adding to the mystery and magic of the fey, blinking lights.\nThat\u2019s where the fireflies live. That\u2019s when they come out.\nBut you won\u2019t ask, because grown-ups aren\u2019t supposed to be interested in fireflies. Our fascination with lightning bugs supposedly ends when we learn the science behind the luminescence; the biology of why they blink and glow when other insects don\u2019t; and the reality that they aren\u2019t magic after all.\nMy family proves these suppositions wrong.\nAt ages 22 and 24, Em and Jaye are grown-ups. The driveway they once decorated with sidewalk chalk is now home to their cars. Beyond the blacktop and the sparse grass of the side lawn, the cedars hold court. On humid summer nights I witness one daughter or the other pull up in her car, get out, pause, and scan the growing darkness, hoping for a glimpse of magic.\nAnd on nights when they\u2019re not out there, I am.\nAccording to Kristian Demary, a biologist with the Boston Museum of Science, most flashing species of fireflies in the Northeast come out between Memorial Day and Labor Day. When my family first moved into this cedar-shaded colonial house two decades ago, it was early September\u2014too late for firefly season. We had to wait nine months to see if our wooded hilltop neighborhood had the right combination of trees, moisture and grassy areas to create the ideal habitat.\nMy memory isn\u2019t reliable anymore; it blinks on and off like a firefly attracting a mate. I can\u2019t share the details of that first sighting because there were so many others through the days, weeks and months of firefly season. I remember that the woods behind the house came alive with pulses of light just at the moment it seemed too dark, too late to expect anything. The girls danced in the dim twilight, cupping their hands and swiping at flashes.\nJaye thrust her arm out to show me a streak of faint but steady light smeared across her skin. Once I explained it was a smushed bug and that the glow wouldn\u2019t last, she grew somber and vowed not to hurt any others.\nWe weren\u2019t completely innocent of any crimes against nature. We ran outside with jars just like generations of kids and parents before us. But we only imprisoned our fireflies for a short while. We tried to be considerate jailers; we punched holes in the lid, placed a piece of damp paper towel at the bottom of the jar, added a handful of grass. Before we went inside and upstairs to bed, we always set them free.\nThe first flakes of snow often delight us; but by the time we see three feet on the ground the charm has melted away. Not so with fireflies. The girls and I could never get enough of that serendipitous, intermittent concert of pale color\u2014those pinpoints of light blossoming, then fading into the dark, all within the span of an hour. Firefly season seemed to grow shorter the older my daughters got.\nWhen Jaye went away to college, she emailed me a Pinterest link featuring faux fireflies in a jar. The instructions call for a clear glass vessel, three glow sticks and glitter. After snapping and activating the glow sticks, you snip off one end, squeeze the contents into a jar, add a touch of glitter, and voila! The end result as shown online looks too vivid not to have been Photoshopped, but it\u2019s a cruelty-free option worth exploring.\nOver the years, the backwoods have thinned. The violent Labor Day storm of 1998 knocked down some trees. Others fell when new neighbors clear-cut their land to install an in-ground pool. Still more trees were lost when one property owner decided a lawn would look nicer than brushwood. We don\u2019t see any fireflies back there anymore. Maybe it\u2019s too open, too dry. Or maybe it\u2019s due to the dwindling firefly population, occurring not just in our neighborhood but around the world according to Firefly.org.\nBut still, our side yard remains a reliable habitat. Between the dense growth of myrtle, the decomposing logs hidden beneath their glossy leaves, and the cooler northern exposure, there\u2019s plenty of moisture and organic matter for the grub stage of the firefly\u2019s life cycle, which lasts up to two years. The fact that the flying insects only glow during the last two weeks of their lives makes their beauty even more poignant.\nI stand just at the edge of the trees, looking for twinkling bursts of light moving low to the ground or floating up into the trees. When I spot them, I call Em over to watch them with me, and Jaye, too, if she\u2019s home for a visit. Our unfailing awe and wonder is proof that we\u2019re never too old for fireflies.\nSo ask us where they live. Better yet, come over and watch them with us.\nSummer may be short, and firefly season even shorter, but as long as the fall of night is heralded by those darting, glowing creatures just outside my door, I continue to believe. Magic is real. Anything is possible.\nLinda Lowen teaches at the Downtown Writer\u2019s Center and is co-producer and co-host of Take Care, a health and wellness radio show on WRVO.

They are winged beetles commonly called fireflies or lightning bugs for their conspicuous use of bioluminescence during twilight to attract mates or prey. Fireflies produce a cold light with no infrared or ultraviolet frequencies. This chemically produced light from the lower abdomen may be yellow green or pale red with wavelengths from 510 to 670 nanometers.\nAbout 2,000 species of fireflies are found in temperate and tropical climates. Many are in marshes or in wet wooded areas where their larvae have abundant sources of food. Their larvae emit light and often are called glowworms in Eurasia and elsewhere. In the Americas, glow worm also refers to the related Phengodidae. In many species both male and female fireflies have the ability to fly but in some species the females are flightless.\nFireflies tend to be brown and soft-bodied often with the elytra or front wings more leathery than those of other beetles. Although the females of some species are similar in appearance to males larviform females are found in many other firefly species. These females can often be distinguished from the larvae only because they have compound eyes. The most commonly known fireflies are nocturnal although numerous species are diurnal. Most diurnal species are not luminescent however some species that remain in shadowy areas may produce light.\nA few days after mating, a female lays her fertilized eggs on or just below the surface of the ground. The eggs hatch three to four weeks later and the larvae feed until the end of the summer. The larvae are commonly called glowworms. Lampyrid larvae have simple eyes. The term glowworm is also used for both adults and larvae of species such as Lampyris noctiluca the common European glowworm in which only the nonflying adult females glow brightly and the flying males glow only weakly and intermittently.\nFireflies hibernate over winter during the larval stage some species for several years. Some do this by burrowing underground while others find places on or under the bark of trees. They emerge in the spring. After several weeks of feeding on other insects snails and worms they pupate for 1.0 to 2.5 weeks and emerge as adults. The larvae of most species are specialized predators and feed on other larvae terrestrial snails and slugs. Some are so specialized that they have grooved mandibles that deliver digestive fluids directly to their prey. Adult diet varies: some are predatory while others feed on plant pollen or nectar. Some like the European glow-worm beetle Lampyris noctiluca have no mouth.\nCool 3D Pics HD Wallpapers - Good Download Free Pictures - Firefly Wallpaper Backgrounds for Mobile Phones."

Cast list and preview.\nClose the curtains, turn off the living-room lights and bask in the glow of this otherworldly one-off from the master. David Attenborough initiates us in a subject that fascinates him \u2013 bioluminescence, the living glow produced by creatures from fireflies to rippling squid.\nMany examples are filmed here for the first time, using recent breakthroughs in camera technology, and the results have a fairytale quality. Not just flirting fireflies but fungi that glow underground (why?), or the larvae of Tasmanian gnats that mimic the night sky on their cave ceiling to lure in prey \u2013 one of those natural scenes that looks almost too odd to be real.\nIn some cases, Attenborough has to admit that these wonders are as yet unexplained. We hate to hear him say, \u201cWe still don\u2019t understand\u201d, but as he points out, that means a field rich in possibility for scientists of the future.\nDavid Attenborough explores the world of bioluminescence, the often spectacular natural light produced by creatures including glow-worms, fireflies and plankton, using specially designed cameras, some fitted to a new generation of deep-sea submersibles and robots to record instances in the very deep ocean. The programme shows a millipede glowing on the forest floor in California, the mesmerising flashing light patterns of the synchronous firefly, the spooky glow of a rare dragon fish and luminous earth worms in France.\nDavid Attenborough on conservation: \"Someone has to solve it before we poison ourselves out of existence\""

It\u2019s yours to watch from the comfort of your balcony or poolside lounger with your favourite drink to hand. Raise a toast to another magnificent tropical sunset.\nHaving bid a fiery goodbye the sun takes a bow, and the dark curtain of night closes in on another day. In the brief twilight, the fireflies come out to play. Their twinkling glow seeming to rise and fall to the rhythm of the waves.
