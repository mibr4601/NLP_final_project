A few days later Joan stood in front of the mirror, wary of what she will see. At first there was nothing, but as she started to leave she saw something out of the corner of her eye. Joan turned with an air of bravery, and faced the mirror head on. Her brother quickly came and was soon standing in front of the mirror.

The thought of being alone in the wretched home haunted her mind and her memories. It seemed almost cliche at the sound of the rain and thunder that something horrific would happen. It seemed almost cliche that she was being stalked; and she knew it too. She liked to call it 'The Doctor', though it had no name at her current recognition. It was in her home, though, watching her while she slept. Though, she couldn't help but wonder what had exactly happened within a time span of two hours. She only knew one thing that could have summoned the demon into her life. She went to the hospital to visit one of her friends who had recently been through a car accident. After recovering, Farah congratulated her friend on her success and ability to walk again. She had left the hospital room when the fire began. Flames had burst out everywhere from a gas leak in the floor below. The first floor of the hospital was where her dearest friend was located; the emergency ward. The fire spread to a conflagration on the upper floors. The treatment couldn't heal a scorched heart, however, and the nurse died an awful death. Doors would open and shut, her radio would turn on and off, and she would see hideous reflections in her mirror. She had lit several candles and gathered around a mirror, and began her experiment. Within moments, she was granted her wish. A being of a bandaged up face emerged from the mirror. It had bloodied bandages covering its face, and bandaged hands and feet. In the right hand it carried a small lighter. The chest of the creature was covered up by a green and burned hospital gown. The candles burned out in seconds as the creature stuck its hand through the window and grabbed the side of the wall. It crawled from the mirror one limb at a time, staring at Farah while still menacingly exiting the mirror. Farah screamed and ran for her front door, but no matter how hard she tried it would not open. She looked through the slits in the door and saw and heard nothing. Silence filled the room as she stepped out of the closet cell. Expecting something to be waiting for her, nothing was there but an empty hallway. She backed into the room and looked over to the closet. The door was shut. She went into the bathroom and shut the door behind her. She splashed her face in the sink beneath her and lifted her head up to the bathroom mirror. It shifted completely until eventually revealing the arm as it climbed out from the container again. The lights in her home went out, and the entire room was black. The door of the bedroom slowly shifted open, and the creature (again, known as the doctor) sneaks into the room. It flicks the lighter open and looks around, aiming at the closet. Farah panicked as the cretin maneuvered to the door and lifted the knob. It seemed to smile as it tilted its head to the side, and proceeded to grab her neck and lift it into the air. She is slammed down to the ground, gasping for breath as she slides across the floor to the front door. The Doctor looks down and smirks as it shifts its body weight toward her, reaching down to grab her leg as she scoots off. Her leg is grabbed, and the doctor drags her to the back wall and slams her up against it. The Doctor slides away from her, looking for something to light on fire. It collapses onto her bed, and Farah, still gripping her intestines to hold them inside, manages to scoot her way to the staircase. She fumbles down the stairs until meeting up with a desk and a telephone. She lifts it up to call 911, and turns to the mirror she began the session of horror with. She saw her reflection again, and as the officer picked up, she saw it twist. And that's all the officer could achieve in spitting out until Farah was grabbed by the neck and drug to the mirror, where her neck was snapped and the mirror broken.

This was an especially fun tale to craft for, I have been looking forward to making all seven dwarfs as well as Snow White. Once there was a queen, who sat in her window sewing, she pricked her finger and a few drops of blood fell on her snow covered, ebony window sill. The queen sees this, and wishes for a beautiful daughter who has skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, and hair as black as her ebony window frame. Not long after the Queen gives birth to a beautiful baby girl who has skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, and ebony black hair. \"Mirror, Mirror, on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?\" The years go by, and Snow White grows up into a very beautiful young women. The queen, as usual, poses her question to the mirror \" Mirror, Mirror, on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?\" But Snow White is a thousand times fairer than you.\" The queen is furious and becomes full of hatred toward Snow White. The Queen orders a huntsman to take Snow White out into the woods and kill her, and as proof to bring back her lungs and liver ( in other versions it is the heart). The huntsman, upon seeing Snow White's beauty, falls in love with her, and cannot kill her, he tells Snow White to run away and hide from the evil queen. The huntsman kills a boar (in some versions a deer) and brings its lungs and liver to the queen. However when the queen again questions her mirror, and it still answers that Snow White is the prettiest, the Queen knows she has been tricked. Meanwhile, Snow White comes upon a small house in the woods, it is the home of seven dwarfs. The seven Dwarfs agree to let Snow White live with them, in exchange for her cooking and cleaning. The Queen learns that Snow White is alive and living in the woods, and devises and evil plan to kill Snow White. The Queen however has disguised herself as a kind old peddler woman, and when the dwarfs leave, she is able to trick Snow White into buying a lace up bodice. The Queen in disguise ties the bodice laces too tight on Snow White and Snow White faints dead. Luckily the dwarfs return in time to help Snow White, and when they loosen the laces, she can breath again, and comes back to life. The Queen again learns that Snow White is alive after hearing from her mirror that Snow White is still the fairest. Again the queen disguises herself as another kind looking women, who after the dwarfs leave, is able to trick Snow White into letting her comb her hair with a poison comb. The Queen returns home, and luckily the dwarfs come home in time to save Snow White who is revived when they remove the poison comb. The queen is furious when she learns Snow White is still alive, and comes up with another evil plan, this time creating a poisonous apple. When the Queen returns in disguise to Snow White, the queen offers her the apple. This time Snow White is more hesitant, so the queen, who has made only the red half of the apple poison, offers to eat the whiter half of the apple to prove to Snow White that the apple is not poison. Snow White is then tricked into taking a bite of the poison apple, at which time she falls down dead. They build her a glass coffin, as Snow White still looks as beautiful as when she was alive, and looked as if she was only asleep. The Dwarfs could see how the prince loved Snow White, so eventually they decided to let the Prince keep Snow White in her glass coffin. As the Prince's servants are carrying her away they stumble upon a root and Snow White is jostled, which causes the piece of poisoned apple to dislodge from her throat, and she wakes up, alive again. The Queen was very angry, and eventually decided to go see who this young queen was, when she went to the wedding, she recognized Snow White right away. I remember reading this version as a child, it has been quite some time since I have seen the Disney version, which I also remember enjoying as a child.

DuVernay, whose last two films (the MLK bio Selma and the mass-incarceration doc 13th) racked up three Oscar nods in as many years, thus became the face of Wrinkle, despite more recognizable castmembers like Reese Witherspoon, Oprah Winfrey, Mindy Kaling and Chris Pine. As the first live-action $100 million project helmed by a woman of color, A Wrinkle in Time had to tell two feel-good stories: that of a biracial teen (played by Storm Reid) learning to love and trust herself, and that of female artists and artists of color triumphing in an industry that has traditionally disregarded their perspectives and contributions. But first, it's important to note the ludicrously unfair burden that Wrinkle was saddled with as soon as DuVernay signed on and turned protagonist Meg into a biracial girl: It had to be both artistically dazzling and a commercial hit in order for it to be considered any kind of success. The mega-successes of Black Panther and Wonder Woman have been widely analyzed, correctly, as evidence that audiences were starved for representation. Is the centering of women of color too \"niche\" for mainstream viewers? It seems pretty obvious that the answer to the questions above is an adamant \"no.\" Black Panther and Wonder Woman built on previous franchises and deliberately hewed to a crowd-pleasing formula (which is not meant as criticism, simply a matter of fact). DuVernay pursued a different vision; she intentionally eschewed a final battle scene, for example, that would've made Wrinkle conform more to other multiplex fare. It's ridiculous to base the social \"value\" of girls and women of color's stories on one movie, and simply unjust to put that weight on one woman's shoulders. It's also annoying that advocates of diversity are forced once again into a defensive posture, making a case for one of our own, when the problem has always been the scarcity of opportunities, not the merits of inclusion. I realize that the current argument for a more diverse entertainment landscape is largely predicated on black, brown, yellow, female and LGBTQ artists outperforming the straight white male average; their work has to be good, if not superlative. All I can say is that I hope the executives who wield greenlighting power look at auteurs of any background as fallible human beings, as well as visionaries. DuVernay certainly proves herself as such with Wrinkle. I also admired the injection of the floridly supernatural into West Adams, a historically black neighborhood in Los Angeles (not far from where DuVernay grew up), and, of course, the beauty of the various extraterrestrial terrains, some of which brought me to tears. A Wrinkle in Time is, arguably above all, a visual feast. What she has made is an endlessly watchable one, and I hope critics, at least, will soon embrace those other elements in addition to the film's social milestones \u2014 just like they'd do with any other notable movie.", "hit_ratio": 0.4375}, {"doc_text": "THE spot by the window is generally considered the best seat in the office. But one gran has warned of the dangers of sitting by a window every day, after she got sun damage on one side of her face - which gave her wrinkles through the glass. For a decade, practice manager Dawn Jafkins sat at a desk one-metre from the window in the doctor's surgery she works in. As the years passed, the 49-year-old became more self-conscious about the wrinkles around the top of her cheeks, which were particularly prominent on the left-hand side. She was hoping Botox and fillers could improve the wrinkles, but Dr Aarti said this wouldn't work - because of the sun damage and loss of collagen to her face. Dawn explained she's always careful with her skin, wearing SPF30 when out in the sun, applying anti-wrinkle creams (with little to no effect) and never using sunbeds. Dr Aarti prescribed two Skintech TCA skin peels - which cost \u00a3350 each - to be applied two to four weeks apart. It triggers the production of collagen, speeding up the shedding of the damaged surface layers of skin, revealing brighter and tighter skin which looks and acts younger. Dr Aarti told her patient the skin would turn darker in the areas which had the most sun damage, but Dawn was shocked when only one side of her face changed colour.

Next thing I knew I was running up the street, but my legs felt leaden, just like one of those nightmares I had as a kid. It was like I couldn't remember how to run. I couldn't seem to pull my legs along, as desperately as I wanted to reach my daughter. It seemed to take all day to run two short blocks, to the grassy green spot where my daughter was lying on her back, her leg bent most unnaturally, her head pressed against the ground, the blazing sun staring her in the face. Margaret had said, \u201cI'll go get the money and you go wait by the truck.\u201d Clare had bolted into the street without thinking, and was hit.

I entered through the back yard gate, with Frank pushing Clare in her wheelchair a short way behind me. I looked at the sunflowers we'd planted. It now lay face down in the dirt, its pretty head beginning to wither and wilt in the staring sun, the stem sharply bent and all but completely severed. It reminded me of Clare's broken leg. There seemed no way to save it, but I couldn't stand to see it all bent and broken. I did what I could to stand it upright, splinting it on both sides with two sticks in the ground. The sticks were three feet high, so I rested the sunflower's head on one of them, and held the severed stem in place with a piece of twisted wire. But someone must have pushed those sticks further into the ground, as the sunflower's head was now unsupported, and only had its own fragile stem to lean on. \u201cLet's go outside and check the sunflowers,\u201d I said to Clare. Some weeks later I walked to the kitchen window. I thought I must be hallucinating, because the larger sunflower seemed to have gotten nearer.

It seemed to have reached its maximum height! We went back upstairs and, as always, the next thing happened, so we forgot about the sunflowers once again.

On the morning we got home from that doctor's visit, Clare flopped down on the futon and grabbed the remote, as I walked into the kitchen to fix her a meal. I looked out the kitchen window and gasped. Clare walked casually into the kitchen on her new cast, and there we both stood, gaping in stunned disbelief at the sight outside our sunny, east facing, second-story kitchen window. We both slowly approached the window, unable to quite believe what we were seeing - the face of a gigantic sunflower, about a basketball in diameter, staring right back at us through a 2nd story window! \u201cLet's go check the sunflowers!\u201d I said, but Clare had already bounded down the steps like her leg was never broken. \u201cCareful!\u201d I yelled out to her, wondering why I bother.

I briefly explained why the hike appealed to me - that my mum had taken her own life a couple of months before my son's first birthday and that I wanted to do something in her memory as well as raise awareness and money - but I didn't give much consideration to the hike itself. I have family near the Lake District so I'm familiar with the area, and hiking's just an endurance test really isn't it? I thought about it more after submitting my application form, and I settled on two facts: 1) this was going to be really difficult - both physically (hiking 40 mountainous miles in 24 hours is no walk in the park) and from a fundraising perspective (there's a minimum sponsorship level of \u00a3650); and 2) I absolutely had to get a place. I wrote to Mind. I explained I didn't think I'd done a great job on my application form, gave them some more information about myself, and upped my sponsorship target from the minimum to \u00a31,000. I explained how I planned to raise the money: I'd set up a fundraising page, as recommended, I'd do bake sales, I'd ask for donations from corporations \u2013 I'd basically make sure I met my target. I really wanted to do it and I really wanted to do it properly. I'd thought that I'd share some information about what happened to my mum on the page, but what came out when I sat down to write it shocked even me. I think I was ready to open up. I wrote paragraph after paragraph about our relationship, her interactions with my son and what it was like to hear she'd taken her own life. It just poured out. We found out more later; she'd taken her life downstairs in our family home while my dad was upstairs working. I was devastated. And more than that, I was furious. I recall holding a glass and wanting so badly to hurl it across the kitchen. And then I remembered. I have a baby. I can't cover my kitchen in tiny shards of glass, put glass on his high chair, on his toys.

This seems like a pretty cut and dry statement that leaves very little room for interpretation. However, there\u2019s always an exception to the rule and in the case of undeliverable mail that exception is things like periodicals, which are deemed to have little to no value after a certain point due to their timely nature and will be disposed of accordingly. The Postal Service has had measures in place to deal with these so-called \u201cdead letters\u201d almost since the service first began in earnest in the 1700s with the awesomely named position of Inspector of Dead Letters, being created by an act of Congress way back in 1777. The first Dead Letter Office, on the other hand, wouldn\u2019t exist until 1825, when the sheer amount of dead mail necessitated the creation of a dedicated service to deal with it all. In any event, as noted on their website, the Mail Recovery Center generally doesn\u2019t accept anything worth less than about $25 or something that can\u2019t reasonably be traced back to someone like keys, cosmetics and food. You might at this point be wondering what about if they find money and despite their best efforts they can\u2019t track down who sent the letter or where to send it to? First, a Mail Recovery Clerk has to physically open the letters and packages to discern exactly what they contain, making people in this position just about the only individuals in the US legally allowed to open another person\u2019s mail without it being a federal crime. Beyond just opening the packages and letters, the mail clerks in question will go to fairly extensive lengths to try and return or deliver dead mail. In one case noted in a Smithsonian piece on the day in the life of one of these workers, the worker at the center of the article, Vera, opened a package with no identifying marks whatsoever on the outside, but managed to use a phone number contained inside to ultimately track down the package\u2019s original owner. In another case, the aforementioned postal worker Lori Ferguson-Costa got a call from a woman who\u2019d recently had her baby die of SIDS. Essentially, any clue whatsoever, even small ones, in the package will be followed up on until the clerk manages to find out where the package was intended to go or who sent it. As for how long this all takes, the usual amount of time the Mail Recovery Office will hold things varies and is handled on a case-by-case basis depending on the item and the clerk\u2019s preference. For example, if the item in question is clearly worth a lot of money or seems like it probably holds significant sentimental value like a wedding dress or jewellery, the Mail Recovery Office will hold onto it for upwards of a year (and in some cases even longer, such as a jar containing the cremated remains of one W.C.G. According to official figures, they are able to deliver or return 68% of the dead mail \u201cwith obvious value\u201c, a figure which drops to a lower, but not insignificant 43% when you factor in all dead mail. We found the company selling the books, who agreed to give them back to the USPS if they could get their auction money back. The USPS refused to give us our $100 for the unshipped books and refused to even call the company that had bought them at auction. I filled out a Mail Recover Center Search Request form at my local post office Sept 12th, 2014. I received a package from one of my best friends that was supposed to contain a birthday present for myself. It was opened and only a card was in the mailer.

The boy continued through the forest until he reached a clearing where a family of deer, including one rather large buck, grazed on the thick vegetation of the forest floor. On the far side of the clearing, he noticed a young woman dart behind a tree. \u2014 Well, well, a hunter. \u2014 You\u2019re a peculiar one. . . hunting so close to the city, \u2014 the boy thought to himself. He considered stopping the hunter and saving the deer, but something prompted him to watch instead. He saw the world around him in black and white, every sound illuminated a new object. He saw the doe running away from the clearing, her heartbeat skipping and struggling to pump blood through her wounded body. We\u2019re having a real meal.\u201d The girl\u2019s voice was indeed in the mood of a celebration, but not over the kill. Her intentions seemed noble enough.\u201d The boy\u2019s voice was a whisper, barely audible over the hunter\u2019s footsteps. As the girl left the clearing, the boy followed. \u2014 It is a shame that deer will go to waste, \u2014 the boy thought, knowing it was his duty to arrest her and bring her before the elders for trial. The boy could feel the presence of the god of earth, assuring him that the deer had been his gift to her. I would have been obligated to arrest you for poaching otherwise.\u201d He would have tried to stop himself, but the words had escaped his mouth before he could register what he was saying. This girl was no older than he was, and it wasn't like non-pretty girls were any safer. \"Do you mind if I take from that doe what you cannot carry?\u201d The girl\u2019s posture seemed to relax slightly, and the look of anxiety cleared from her face. I know the way back to the city; the journey is easy enough.\u201d The hunter was nervous, stumbling over her words as she talked. Bahn lifted his head towards the girl, and for a moment their eyes met. The hunter\u2019s cheeks turned red as she looked away. I do hope we meet again.\u201d Bahn stood, holding his fist over his chest before nodding his head at Ayela. Once she was gone, Bahn rose to his feet; he had never intended to take any of the doe, he merely wanted the hunter to relax. The rest of the day passed without event as Bahn continued through the forest, his mind continually returning to Ayela. Bahn still could not shake the feeling that there was something special about Ayela, that he was somehow meant to find her amidst the sea of trees. It was nearing sunset, and Bahn had begun to travel back to the village. His first shift was over, and he had not failed his duties. The village was calm and quiet, just as it always was. He was the youngest sentinel; he also carried a higher capacity for magic than most sentinels in the village. However, unlike any sentinel before him, Bahn also shared a small connection to dark magic. They feared that Ban\u2019s strength would overtake him and that he would become a servant of darkness. Ban eventually reached his home, a small hut at the northern edge of the village. He could smell the sweet aroma of a fresh meal emanating from the house. Bahn closed his eyes and took in the smell of the soup still simmering in the large iron pot in the center of the table. \u201cHow was your first day as a Sentinel?\u201d Ban\u2019s mother stood next to him. Bahn recalled how, in his childhood, he would stare into his mother\u2019s deep blue eyes, getting lost in the sea of emotions that flowed behind them. They shared the same bright green eyes, black hair, and dark skin. This was natural, as both of them were Eeshkadu, earth elementals, whereas Ban\u2019s mother was an Eeshma, a water elemental. Where are they sending me?\u201d Bahn was afraid of the answer, but he was also anxious for the chance to prove his strength and self-control to the elders. Ban\u2019s mother filled a bowl of soup for each of them and sat at the table. We have trained you your whole life to resist the darkness. However, you have never been in a situation to test your resilience before now.\u201d Ban\u2019s mother grabbed hold of his hand and squeezed. If you give into the power. . .\u201d His mother stopped, unable to finish her sentence. Yet no matter how many times he heard it, the concept of not fearing the darkness was far easier said than done. He took extra care not to forget his thick leather armor for this patrol; the northern forest was densely populated by beasts of prey, and he needed the additional protection. His mother and father would be in the garden, and he wanted to say farewell before heading to the elders for the usual parting ceremony. \u201cWe were just coming in to wake you.\u201d His mother\u2019s voice was calm and even and seemed to pacify the storm of dread, worry, and anxiety that swam through Ban\u2019s mind. The three of them walked in silence to the north side of the village, where three of the four village elders and a woman Bahn did not recognize stood waiting.Judging by her armor, the woman was a seeker, an elite of the Shaforesi Guard. The elders were in their usual ceremonial robes of bright green and blue; their faces were covered by their hoods, leaving only their eyes exposed. The elder in the center nodded his head toward Ban. He believes it blasphemy to allow one with a connection to the darkness into the ranks of the sentinels.\u201d His voice was deep and rough; it carried a tone of irritation that Bahn assumed was directed at the absent elder. Toraw is a seeker of the fourth rank.\u201d The elder motioned to the woman whose eyes fell judgingly on Ban. \u201cWe do not expect you to succeed in resisting the darkness, but should you return victorious we will raise you to Sentinel of the Second Rank.\u201d The third elder\u2019s voice was high and rough. The first time Bahn had heard it, had had nearly burst into laughter. \u201cDo you accept the patrol, or will you give up on this foolish notion of joining the guard.\u201d The second elder leaned toward the one standing in the center. He whispered something that caused the center elder to grunt in brief laughter. The small promotion was meaningless to Bahn as he did not care about rank. However, the mockery by the elders brought fire to his eyes. \u201cI do.\u201d Ban\u2019s voice was that of confidence, inspired by anger and the desire to prove the elders wrong. \u201cI will return in one week with an even stronger resolve against the darkness than I already possess.\u201d Bahn fell to one knee and awaited the blessing of the elders.

He had a strange ring on his finger, made not of metal, but of wood\u2013sandalwood some said who had seen it. He arrived with the new moon and though it waxed and waned and he did nothing further to disrupt life in the village, the villagers remained curious and wary. Soon the rumor spread that the stranger had developed a rivalry with one of the villagers, a man who lived near the border between the village and the forest. When the stranger and this villager passed in the street, they would each stiffen and ignore the other. When the two came into the pub, they would glare at each other. Others began wearing wool cloaks and growing beards, like the villager. Soon, it seemed that everyone was either favoring the stranger or favoring the villager. The two rivals did nothing to stop such behavior. Even most of the village elders had chosen sides. The few elders who had not chosen sides worried that the village would fall to riot and ruin if the feud did not end. And so, the three elders who remained yet untouched by the feud met in secret to discuss what should be done. And yet, they were the elders and they loved their village and their people. But they hoped that the spell of the feud would be broken once the two rivals left, and that the villagers would regain their reason and be unified once more. But the morning after this secret meeting, the three elders found their fellow villagers in the streets. The villagers were armed with butcher knives, mops, wooden beams, and the like, and were arguing as one. In the center stood the two rivals, the stranger and the villager. The elders could see there were no children in the crowd, but before they could give thanks for that and before they could utter any pleas for reason and peace, someone was struck, someone yelled out, and the villagers surged toward each other. But there were broken arms and legs, and blood everywhere from stabs and cuts and bruises, and one woman could not move her limbs, and one man had lost an eye. And the three elders were thankful it had not been worse, for they had feared that by nightfall, there would be no one left in the village who was not a corpse. The three elders found the stranger and the villager, and restraining their great anger and their great fear, they asked the men to leave. The stranger and the villager declared that their feud was not yet over, but agreed that they would settle their differences without involving the villagers. They gave no apology and no reparation. And the villagers, their might spent and their senses stunned, went home to heal themselves. That same night a storm broke out of a clear sky. Lightning crashed around the village. Thunder boomed. The pelting of ice and the drumming of rain became the music of their days and nights. Some claimed they could see figures in the clouds, and arms hurling lighting or giant fistfuls of hail. But most were tired of such stories and wanted only to see the blue sky and the yellow sun. The villagers had grown weary of the commotion and of their own feud. As suddenly as it had come, the storm vanished. A gentle sun rose and melted and dried and warmed the village. The villagers rebuilt their village and went about their lives. To the approval of the three elders who had refused to take sides, the villagers had learned to be kinder to each other, gentler with each other, and slower to anger. And in the middle of the forest, they found the stone hut. And from that stone hut came the scent of sandalwood.", "hit_ratio": 1.1711711711711712}, {"doc_text": "The flames licked around the limbs of the dead, a young man named Siaki. The smell of charred flesh stuck to the Shaman\u2019s hair and clothes and crept down his throat. In the bitterness of the morning, he questioned his loyalty to the village and to the gods. They could be trusted with cleaning the bones before they could be ground to powder and mixed into the sand of the beach. He placed the last bone, Siaki\u2019s skull, at the base of the tallest palm and cradled it into a depression in the sand. There, he knelt and offered one last prayer for the safe passage of Siaki\u2019s soul to the afterlife. Each duty he fulfilled, each birth, each successful harvest, and each winter ritual added another narrow band of color. The walk back to the village from the secluded beach pressed harder against his heart with each passing year. Makana with the silken shoulders, his wife, waited under the lip of the rise, as she had each year since the day they had been joined. May his soul find happiness there.\u201d The lie brought with it a taste of ash and bile in his throat. Liko held a collection of two-pronged spears and stood on the edge of a rock as he studied the water. The Shaman rubbed at the tense spot between his eyes. For the last several years, Liko had been asking to come along with him and learn how to give the ceremonial offerings on behalf of the one traveling to the island. Maintaining a serene face, despite the raging storm of emotion that threatened to overwhelm him, took energy that the Shaman did not have. Facing the family of a boy that he knew was dead would test him once more. Having a child chosen among all the youth brought the family great honor. The sight of the family, so content, so at peace, made the Shaman wish the gods would allow at least one of these youth to reach the golden shore instead of claiming them all. It was by the grace of the gods that they knew of the Golden Island. No one knows what the future holds.\u201d The Shaman gave a short bow and turned before Siaki\u2019s father could continue talking of the future. When the Shaman returned to his hut he found Liko pacing back and forth deep in thought. The Shaman selected one of the leaf wrapped morsels from the basket in the center of the small space. Ever since he had earned his first feathers, the boy had tested his limits. \u201cSince when do you get to decide when to learn parts of your trade?\u201d He proceeded carefully, each word measured and delivered with quiet precision. The son gave another bow, so formal, too formal. The Shaman wished he could hold Liko in his arms like he used to when the boy was small. The next winter equinox would come far too fast and with it, the return of the island. The Shaman recovered Siaki\u2019s skull, now grey and picked clean and could not help but think that the next skull would be that of his own son. Grieving something that was not certain would only poison the remaining months before the contest. With a sharp stylus, he inscribed the bone with Siaki\u2019s life, his name, his deeds. When the tide dropped low, he walked out into the water and ducked under the waves to the hidden entrance of the cave. He pushed through the darkness, feeling the familiar pain of air burning in his lungs. Inside the cave, a dim light filtered down from a small opening high above. Knowing that his father before him had done the same grim task alone for so many years before he had come of age to help, eased the burden. Days and weeks passed, fast and steady like the tide. For the children reaching their 17th cycle, this was the last chance to prove themselves worthy of taking part of the yearly contest. The nights grew cooler and the sun\u2019s rays at sunset crept closer and closer toward the notch between the two mountains. Each evening when the sun dipped low to the horizon, the Shaman measured the path of light and shadow. Runners leapt up from around the fire, like flying embers, to notify those living on other parts of the isle. Makana and Liko cheered along with the rest while the Shaman held his silence. \u201cOf course,\u201d he said, giving her hand one last squeeze. The council debated long into the night, as they had done each year. Only the best of the youth could be chosen. It was his right and privilege to honor the family. When the council adjourned, the Shaman could not rest. He wandered the island until he found himself on the sacred ground of the isolated beach. When the morning came, the Shaman returned home. A cluster of children stood in awe around Liko along with a sizable group of girls who had already passed their seventeenth year. Their skin shone, brilliant in the morning sun, and the beads in their hair rustled in the ocean breeze. One by one the elders walked the line, pulling those chosen forward. As they approached Liko, the boy\u2019s eyes met those of the Shaman. He had expected to see fear there, as he had seen in so many of the other boys and girls. Instead, Liko\u2019s gaze was firm and steady. His face remained calm as the elders pulled him forward, showing nothing of what he must be feeling inside. In the crowd, tears of pride ran down Makana\u2019s face. He met Liko\u2019s gaze once more and gave him a nod. Thoughts of having to burn his son\u2019s body made it hard to do anything more. With the selection finished the council wasted no time organizing the first event, a race around the perimeter of the island. The twelve selected youth toed the line drawn in the sand. The crowd went silent, waiting for his signal. The stick fell. When it touched the sand, the twelve ran, churning up clouds with their bare feet. Younger brothers and sisters ran to the steep sides of the closer sister volcano to watch as their siblings made the circuit, calling out who was in the lead to those waiting below. Learning that it had the opposite effect, that it was what pushed him harder and longer than the other children, made the Shaman\u2019s hands shake. A shout arose from the far edge of the beach as competitors rounded the final corner. The last stretch returned the runners to the soft sands of the beach. The Shaman silently willed Liko to trip, so that anyone other than him would win. Other events such as swimming, fishing, and wrestling came and went filling that day and most of the next. The Shaman struggled to bring himself to watch, knowing that each victory brought the boy that much closer to his death. At the end of the afternoon, Liko stood with his head held high. He had won. People, hundreds of them, swept around Liko, eager to congratulate him on a job well done. A frail hand tugged on his elbow. Elder Iana, the eldest of the council, was so old and bent that his white tufted head only reached the Shaman\u2019s shoulder. The Shaman did not need to look to know that the Golden Island had appeared in the distance. The tribe would be waiting for him to perform the farewell ceremony. The Shaman wrapped his hand around his staff, feeling each of the bands under his palm, each death, each birth, each sickness. The Shaman held his arms out wide and the noise of the crowd quieted. When they released each other the crowd surged again, forcing them apart and urging Liko into the waves. He slipped away and over the ridge where the village believed he did everything in his power to protect and guide the victor in his journey. Back on the isolated beach, accompanied by the whispers of the sea, the Shaman constructed the funeral pyre one heavy log at a time. The last thing he could offer his son was a steady strong fire to consume his body and send his soul rising and spiraling up into the heavens. When the pyre was finished, he wiped the fibers of the coconut husk kindling from his hands and knelt in the sand of the beach. Even with his faith broken, he would continue to pray on behalf of his son as he waited and watched for the boy\u2019s body to return. Each year for the past thirty years the body had always returned in the hour before the rising of the sun. However, when the morning light spilled over the edge of the sea there was still no sign of Liko. The thought of the gods accepting his son when they had rejected so many should have brought him happiness. The people needed his devotion to fortify their own. The Shaman walked the length of the beach, searching the rocks and around the base of the cliffs for any sign of his son. He paced the length of the beach once more allowing another, and another, hour to pass. His thoughts drifted to Makana waiting for the sign, waiting for him, on the other side of the ridge. Whatever fears haunted him, he knew hers would be worse. She needed to believe all was well, that Liko had reached a better place. Perhaps he had. The Shaman set his flint to the base of the pyre, setting the logs ablaze. Only then did the Shaman allow himself to mourn the loss of his son. With all of the other children he knew the certainty of their fate. The heat from the fire dried the tears that would not stop flowing. For so long, he had prepared his heart for the day where he would be the one to burn his son\u2019s body and commit his bones to the sand of the beach. He could never have prepared himself for this. The fire burned to ash. The emptiness remained. Elder Iana and his own father had always taught that this life was a test. If it had been a test, what was he supposed to learn? His son was gone and he was not sure where. The totems of the Shaman\u2019s office rested in the sand at the base of the ridge that separated him from the village. He took up the heavy chestpiece, the headdress that pinched, and finally the staff. Jodi L.

Bryan and I grew up going to school together and he was like a fourth brother to me. That was the beginning of... well, almost the end. Jenny felt that she had lost her identity, and that her old \"self\" was lost. She had to leave her job since she felt she was no longer useful. She thought of herself as being a drain to the company - unable to perform productively. The Bi Polar was hard on our marriage, and it affected every aspect of our lives. I had to apply for FMLA time at work to be able to help care for Jenny. After a couple of months, I ended up losing my job. She didn\u2019t believe him at first, but over time he was able to break down her trust in me. In the end, he convinced her that the best way to retaliate was by having an affair with him. My trust and respect for Jenny was gone. She, on the other hand, was filled with guilt and shame. As she struggled with her private pain, I struggled with mine. My anger raged inside me, and the only thing that kept me from doing what I instantly wanted to do, was God intervening. I thank God still that He was intervening even then in the midst of all of our sin. Looking back, I can't believe the grip my alcoholism had on me and I continually sought comfort in it instead of God. In the meantime, Jenny continued to struggle. As the burden of guilt and shame began to weigh her down, so did the pain from the realization that her actions had had a profound impact on our kids, our family and our friends. She didn't realize the pain would ripple through all aspects of our lives like the tidal wave of a tsunami. We look back now and see two people who had little to live for. Our world had crumbled into a wasteland of ruins. I knew all along what we needed to do, I had turned my back on God since I was 18 years old, yet even after all the sin we had committed, God didn't give up on us! It was while living in that wasteland of devastation and despair that God came knocking. Out of the blue, my two childhood friends, Tobey Schwartz and Joel Troyer began inviting me to go to church with them. It was as if He ran to embrace me, His prodigal son, as He welcomed me to a new life of hope and joy. I was able to let go of my hurt and anger and in my relationship with Jesus, I found peace like I had never experienced before. Jenny carried with her that day a great deal of fear and shame of her past, and was afraid what people would think of her She worried that she wouldn\u2019t be worthy of God\u2019s forgiveness. As soon as we walked into the sanctuary, she said she felt God\u2019s hand reaching down to her. She thought that if she could just raise her hand to His and ask for forgiveness and salvation, perhaps He would set her free from the burden she\u2019d been carrying for so long. She no longer was worried what people thought of her, she knew she had been redeemed! Since that day, our marriage and lives have been blessed in so many ways!

Visiting her happy place had elevated her mood despite the bad sessions she had. Two of her clients were on the verge of getting a divorce.

She had given everything she could to the relationship. Instead of accepting that they were not compatible she had tried her level best to come up to the mark, make herself compatible with her husband. When she had talked to her friend regarding her marriage, her friend had told her that her relationship was one of those which were not meant to be. Whenever she felt stressed she thought about her little girl. She knew that getting a divorce would be easy since her husband wanted out as well but she was worried about her daughter. She was afraid of the custody battle and the effect it would have on the innocent girl. Thankfully, even that had been a smooth ride. Whenever she came across cases where divorce was inevitable, it reminded her of her own failed relationship. She tried to convince herself that her divorce had been a happy event in her life.

Now Kenya\u2019s ethnic clashes have landed the two men \u2014 one a Kikuyu of the tribe of President Mwai Kibaki, the other a Luo like opposition leader Raila Odinga \u2014 in hospital. There, thanks to a shortage of space in the midst of a flood of violent injuries, they share the same bed. Sospeter Odipo, a Luo, said he doesn\u2019t mind sharing a bed with fellow flower-farmer Peter Ndungu, a Kikuyu, but he says he can no longer live alongside Kikuyus. A month or so ago, few could have believed the tension exposed by elections in a country best known for tourism would prompt conflict that has killed 1,000, displaced 300,000 and been called \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d by the United States and others. \u201cIt was there the whole time but people didn\u2019t want to acknowledge it,\u201d said Paul Brennan, a missionary who has worked in Kenya for the last 30 years. Odinga says Kibaki rigged it. But the seeds of the conflict were sown long ago. Politics, land and ethnicity have combined before to spill into violence. Clashes in the early and the late 90s also caused the deaths of hundreds, mostly Kikuyus, in the Rift Valley. Resentment of the Kikuyu stems even further back, to perceptions that they were favored by colonial power Britain and \u2014 as shrewd businessmen and women \u2014 then emerged from the country\u2019s 42 tribes as the most influential, analysts say. Crowded in central Kenya and encouraged by the independent nation\u2019s first president, himself a Kikuyu, they moved on to and bought land from other groups in the Rift Valley. We bought it,\u201d said Jane Nyaga, 55, a retired Kikuyu teacher, as she sat on her only remaining possession, a sofa, near a police station sheltering refugees. A mob from another tribe, the Kalenjin, burnt her house. What started as the opposition\u2019s rejection of the election has spread \u2014 fuelled, many say, by politicians or elders mobilizing gangs to protect their local interests. Hundreds of youths from the Kalenjin and Kisii tribes battled last Sunday in Chebilat, near Kericho town, shooting arrows and slingshots as each side accused the other of chasing them off their land. The result, said Francois Grignon, Africa Director for the International Crisis Group, has been the collapse of state legitimacy. Meanwhile, in Eldoret, also in the west, a successful Kikuyu businessman who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals said he was tearing up plans to retire there and heading home generations after his family arrived. When clashes permit, buses, trucks and cars load up at makeshift camps, piled high with furniture before crisscrossing the country, ferrying thousands of Kenyans back to homelands. Kikuyus from the west are heading to Central Kenya.

It begins with a discourse on the laws of oaths. The heads of the tribes -- roshei matot -- are gathered together to receive these laws, hence the name of the portion. Next, the Torah calls for vengeance against the Midianites, for their crime against the people of Israel. The wrath of Israel is centered around Balaam who attempted to curse the Children of Israel and who, we are told, \"died by the sword.\" The Torah goes on to describe the ensuing battle, and the spoils of war with which the victorious army returns. The subsequent section tells about the tribes of Reuben and Gad, who requested that they be allotted the grazing land outside of Israel, on the east bank of the Jordan River, in order to accommodate their very large herds. Moses chastises them for this request, and an arrangement is reached whereby these tribes will aid their brethren in the conquest, and only afterwards return to their lands across the River. The Torah adds that half of the tribe of Menashe, son of Joseph, will join them. The connection with the laws of oaths, brought at this particular junction, is not immediately clear; however, this specific issue may be the link between the various topics covered in this Torah portion. As we shall see, the importance of one's word -- or indeed the power of the word -- is the common denominator. It seems quite strange that two tribes are willing to form an allegiance and avoid entering the Land of Israel. This last episode, involving the tribes of Reuben and Gad, deserves further attention. It seems quite strange that two tribes are willing to form an allegiance and avoid entering the Land of Israel. First, they are both first-born to their respective mothers, Leah and Leah's maidservant Zilpah. Second, they have a common marching formation -- the two were in the same group, and when they marched they surrounded the tribe of Shimon. According to the Midrash, these two tribes were exceptionally wealthy, and therefore preferred to remain in the greener pastures outside the Land of Israel. Furthermore, the Midrash sees the section dealing with the spoils of war as directed against these two tribes, as if to say \"if it is money which you seek, God has many ways of providing.\" There was a disproportionate frequency of bloodshed in this territory on the east bank of the Jordan. There is a tradition, brought down in the Talmud (Makot 10a), that there was a disproportionate frequency of bloodshed in this territory. The obvious implication is that there was some sort of moral breakdown in that society. This is a further indication of the bizarre value system, which favored possessions over children. By the time the fighters from these tribes returned from the years of conquest and division of the land, an entire generation was raised without the benefit of their fathers. We can see how the moral breakdown echoed in the request of the two-and-a-half tribes affected the future, but what was its origin? In Genesis we see Reuben standing out on a number of occasions. One such instance is at the sale of Joseph, where he heroically jumps into the fray and attempts to save Joseph from his tormentors. Only later, when Joseph was sold by the others and without Reuben's knowledge, we find out. If something happened to Joseph, he felt that he would surely pay the price. Later, as the story unfolds and the Egyptian vizier demands to see Benjamin before providing more food, Reuben offers that his own sons be killed in the event that Benjamin is not returned unscathed to Jacob. Perhaps he suspected that because of his various indiscretions, he stood to lose the double portion of the first-born, and this offer was a gamble which could win that double portion back. Reuben does not seem to have placed a very high value on the lives of his children. Whether or not this is the case, the fact remains that Reuben does not seem to have placed a very high value on the lives of his children. We therefore should not be all that surprised when Reuben's descendants prioritize in a similar fashion, i.e., possessions before children. Perhaps these three, once united, commiserated on the inequity of losing the rights associated with being the older brother. Perhaps their pact was solidified around the decision to remain outside of the land which should have been theirs, more than anyone else's. After striking of the rock, Moses knew that he could not enter the Land of Israel; thus was the will of God, the word of God. The portion of Gad and Reuben was not part of the land, but one day it would be. Therefore, if they were to stay on the east side of the Jordan -- where Moses was permitted to enter -- and go on to fulfill their side of the deal, then their portion achieves the same status as the rest of the Land of Israel, and effectively God's vow is nullified, because Moses had in fact entered the land. One important part of these laws is that oaths can be challenged and rescinded. Once the tribes of Reuben and Gad hear this, they devise a plan for Moses to join them in Israel. If the vow precluding Moses' entrance to Israel could be reversed, then perhaps the loss of the double portion of Reuben can also be reversed. Moses, for his part, does not seem interested in subterfuge. Delaying the battle and, as a result, his own demise, would have caused the Children of Israel to linger in the desert. Instead, Moses sets off on his final mission, even though its completion will drawn his own death nearer. Even one unnecessary day in the desert was too high a price to be paid; the welfare of the nation always came before personal considerations, and Moses immediately, heroically, sends Joshua to battle the Midianites. A person like Moses can not simply retire and slip out of the public eye. Moses surely does not want to be party to any suggestion which would have a negative effect on the people or the Torah. Moses's approach differs from that of Gad and Reuben in that Moses does not seek to harm the integrity of the Torah, or the Jewish people, whereas Reuben and Gad's suggestion ultimately harmed their own children. The earlier indiscretion of Reuben himself, when he intimated that his children were expendable, reemerges to harm his descendants. Be it motivated by their love of money, or their twisted love for Moses, the result of parents letting their children know that they are not their most valued \"possession,\" proved disastrous for these tribes. Children inevitably learn from the actions and values of their parents. Therefore, the east bank of the Jordan River became a place of violence and bloodshed, and the children of these tribes were the first to be exiled. It was fascinating to see the psychological link between the tribes' actions and their ancestors experiences. I often wonder why, when Reuben and Gad made their request of Moses, why he did not go to God for a solution. When the daughters of Zelophehad approached Moses regarding their father's portion, Moses saught God's intervention. Could things have been different had these two and a half tribes gone over the Jordan along with the rest of the tribes? Rashi (if my memory serves), comments that the answer to the B'nos Tz'lofchad's question was hidden from Moshe, because the daughters were worthy to have the Parsha written in their name, and were demonstrating love of Eretz Yisrael. The two tribes, however, were--at least on a superficial understanding--were demonstrating (again, Apparently), an unwillingness to go into the Land. In this situation, Moshe had to act immediately to assure that a rebellion, similar to what happened with the return of the Spies from seeing the Land, and who spoke derogitorily about the Land. Wouldn't we assume that the booty of Mitzrayim, from Yam Suf and from Sichon, Og, Balak etc was shared equally?

The treaty of 1836 offered inland rights to area Native Americans when it came to hunting, fishing and gathering. The question became, what are the limits? For decades, the tribes believed that these inland rights were still valid and that they did not need to adhere to state hunting and fishing laws and regulations. It made for a few skirmishes between tribal members and state conservation officers, with, frankly, no one wanting to go to court to set the limits there. So the United States, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and the five recognized tribes in the treaty area - Bay Mills Indian Community, the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians and the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians - hammered out the agreement. The agreement covers 13,837,207 acres of lands and inland waters within the boundaries of the 1836 treaty area. In that treaty, the tribes retained the rights when signing away ownership of the 1836 treaty lands, about 37 percent of the land in the state. Of special note is tribal members may engage in hunting, fishing, and gathering activities on tribal lands and lands that are open to the public for those activities. The decree does not open private land for such activities without permission of land owners, which over the years was a fear of many. The agreement also bans gill nets and snagging on inland waters, and no commercial fishing is permitted in inland lakes.

The region of these tribes included the Table Rocks area (Rogue River Valley) which was the traditional homelands of the Takelma tribe. They became one of the \u201cRogue River tribes\u201d along with the Athapaskan (Chasta Costa), and Shasta who joined together in a confederacy to defend their homelands from newcomer settlers and miners who did not respect the previous tribal claims to the land. From the late 1840s until about 1857, there were numerous conflicts and battles in the area between the Rogue River tribes and the newcomers. The culmination of the early conflicts were the treaties of 1853 and 1854 with some of the Rogue River tribes that ceded millions of acres of land to the United States in exchange for peace, safety, and a permanent reservation. Before a permanent reservation was organized, the Rogue River tribes were temporarily removed to the Table Rock Reservation. Settler militias chose to continue to attack the tribes on the reservation in an attempt to exterminate all Indians in southern Oregon. Some of the most powerful tribes chose to form a confederacy and leave the reservation to protect themselves, and fought a series of pitched battles through the Siskiyou Mountains where many people on both sides were killed. In 1855, the United States Army under General John E. Wool (Commander of the Pacific) and the Indian Superintendent of Oregon, Joel Palmer, acted to separate the combatants permanently and the Grand Ronde Indian Reservation was opened in the western Willamette Valley in January of 1856. The first tribes to arrive were the local Kalapuyans, and the Umpqua tribes arrived in late February. The peaceful tribes who remained on the Table Rock Reservation were marched in the dead of winter, over 300 miles to the new encampment \u2013 the Grand Ronde Indian Reservation- between February and March 1856. The tribes were harassed by settlers all the way to the reservation, and while at the reservation they were settled along the South Yamhill River. These removals are known as the Grand Ronde \u201cTrails of Tears.\u201d In the summer of that year, the remaining tribes surrendered and were shipped to Grand Ronde and locations along the coast. In 1857, the Grand Ronde Reservation became a permanent reservation by presidential executive order. To Grand Ronde remained some 27 other tribes from the Willamette Valley, the Columbia River, the Umpqua valley and the Cascade range. Many descendants of the western Oregon tribes are at two reservations, Grand Ronde and Siletz, and they possess native ancestral bloodlines from five or more of the tribes of Oregon. Tecumtum was the Principle Chief of the Etch-ka-taw-wah band of Takelma. Tecumtum signed two treaties with the United States as Principle Chief of his tribe, the Treaty with the Rogue River 1853 and the Treaty with the Rogue River 1854. Tecumtum and his band remained in the Coast Range fighting pitched battles and was the last of the area\u2019s Native headmen to surrender to the U. S. Army near the confluence of the Rogue and Illinois rivers in the spring of 1856. Tecumtum and his band were marched overland along the coast trail to the Coast Reservation in the summer of 1856. After their removal, and some years had passed, Tecumtum found that many of his people were dying of white men\u2019s diseases and the promises made by the Americans had not come to his people on the reservation. It appeared to be that the tribes responsible for leaving the reservation and fighting the Americans had been removed to Siletz, that the government believed they had breached the terms of the treaty, to remain peaceful, and therefore no longer were owed treaty payments. But if this is so, the Americans did not recognize the pressure the tribes were under at the Table Rock Reservation, when the volunteer militias continued to attack and kill the Rogue River people in a series of attempts at extermination. It remains to be determined which party violated the terms of the treaty first. However the tribes at Siletz did not have treaty funding and they had to depend on the annual appropriations of Congress for funding for the Reservation of over 2000 people. His son killed a shaman and because of the agitation on the reservation by his family, he and his son were arrested to be sent to prison. From time immemorial, the native peoples have live here and utilized the environment to live a good life. The Takelma of the Rogue valley lived within the acorn culture, where they would gather and process acorn mush every year. They also gathered camas, manzanita berries and huckleberries and weaving materials. The tribes were weavers and hunters and fishers and lived a very good life. During summer, families traveled to the cooler, forested uplands and harvested berries, dug camas, hunted and fished. The people lived off the dried and stored abundance of the summer\u2019s harvest. Spring was a time for gathering, Weaving materials were ready for harvest and animals and fish were newly arriving for the season.

Our ancestors were a product of this diversity, many of them spoke multiple tribal languages, knew multiple tribal customs, and had family members from other neighboring tribes. This month, Iti Fabvssa takes a look at some of the tribes that were our neighbors 300 years ago, and briefly examines where they are today. Both Chickasaw and Choctaw oral stories indicate that the two tribes were once part of the same group. Yet, by 300 years ago, the Choctaw and Chickasaw had become bitter enemies. Lasting peace was made in 1759. In 1837, the Chickasaw moved in with the Choctaws in Indian Territory (Oklahoma). In 1855, the Choctaw Nation ceded lands for the establishment of the Chickasaw Nation to our west. Alabama - 300 years ago, the Alabama lived to the east of the Choctaw, on the Alabama River. Several generations earlier they had lived in what is now Mississippi. Like the Chickasaws, the Alabama have a language and culture that are similar to the Choctaw, and according to some oral traditions all three tribes were once a part of the same group. During the French colonial period, the Alabama were often allied with the English and regularly fought against the Choctaw. Today the Alabama Coushatta tribe of Texas lives near the town of Livingston, and the Alabama Quassarte tribal town is located within the Muscogee \"Creek\" Nation in Oklahoma. Tohome/Naniaba- In the early 1700s, the Tohome and Naniaba tribes lived to the southeast of the Choctaw, on the Tombigbee River, above its confluence with the Alabama River. Tohome/Naniaba language and culture were similar or identical to Choctaw language and culture of the time period, although the Tohome were said to have darker skin than the Choctaw (Waselkov and Gums 2000). These two small tribes were closely allied with the Choctaw, and allowed Choctaw people to stay in their villages when they were processing salt from nearby springs. In the 1760s, the Tohome/Naniaba joined the Choctaw tribe, so today, some Choctaw tribal members are descended from the Tohome and Naniaba. Under Chief Tvshkalusa, they had fought and crippled an invading Spanish army under Hernando DeSoto, 160 years earlier. The Mobila language was very similar Choctaw, and they had a close political alliance with the Choctaw. The name \"Mobila\" may come from the Choctaw word \"Moieli\", meaning \"To Paddle\" (Halbert 1899:68). Mobile, Alabama, derives its name from the tribe. In the 1760s, some of the Mobila tribe joined the Choctaw, others moved on to Louisiana. The Pensacola spoke a Muscogean dialect, and in 1700 were fighting against the Mobila and later against the Choctaws. A few years afterwards, the Pensacola moved to the Pearl River and then vanished from recorded history (Waselkov and Gumm 2000:21-23). Pascagoula - The Pascagoula lived to the south of the Choctaws. The two tribes were on good terms and their connectedness is shown through similar pottery designs. In the late 1700s, the Pascagoula moved west, and today some of their descendants are among several Oklahoma/Texas tribes today. In 1700, they lived on the Pascagoula River, south of the Pascagoula tribe. Some Biloxi descendants moved to Texas and Oklahoma, others amalgamated with the Tunica tribe. In 1700, they lived on the east bank of the Mississippi River, across from the mouth of the Red River. In 1706, after an attack by the Tunica, the tribe moved to the New Orleans area. In 1700, this tribe lived on the Pearl River, to the southwest of the Choctaw. Culturally and linguistically related to the Choctawan groups, after a series of movements, they merged with the Houma. Natchez - The Natchez lived on the Mississippi River to the west of the Choctaw. They spoke their own language and were noted for their centralized political structure After repeated affronts by the French, the Natchez attacked and routed the local French settlement in 1730. In retaliation, the French, and their Choctaw allies decimated the Natchez tribe. Today, some individuals living among the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, the Muscogee \"Creek\" Nation, and the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma identify themselves as Natchez. Tunica - The Tunica were living near the mouth of the Yazzoo River in 1700. Today, their descendants make up part of the Tunica-Biloxi tribe of Louisiana. Yazoo - The tribe lived on the Yazoo River to the northwest of the Choctaw. They spoke a language that was related to Tunica (Barnett 2012:77). Interestingly, in the 1700s, two Choctaw towns were named \"East Yazoo\" and \"West Yazoo.\" Their relationship to the Yazoo tribe is unknown. In 1730, the Yazoo attacked the French along with the Natchez. Afterwards, the Yazoo tribe was decimated by the Quapaw. The Chakchiuma are said to have broken off from the Choctaw, moved to present-day Arkansas, and then to have been forced back into present-day Mississippi between the Choctaw and Chickasaw. Reportedly the Chakchiuma began raiding both the Choctaw and Chickasaw. Finally, a Choctaw/Chickasaw coalition destroyed the Chakchiuma tribe, with survivors joining the Choctaw and Chickasaw. Taensa - In 1700s, the Taensa were living in present-day northeast Louisiana. Through the 1700s, they moved down the Mississippi River to near New Orleans, and then over to the Mobile, Alabama, area, where they presumably mixed with Choctawan people. Today, a formal Taensa tribe does not exist, but their descendants are among the Choctaw, Chitimacha, and Alabama tribes. Quapaw- The Quapaw are a Siouan tribe, closely related to the Osage, Kansa, and Omaha. In 1700, they were living at the junction of the Arkansas and the Mississippi River. At times, the Quapaw were Choctaw trading partners. Cushman, Horatio B. 1899. History of the Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Natchez Indians. Headlight Printing House, Greenville, Texas.

The Raven had no warm place to land and play, so he asked the Sun to warm it up. The Sun then rose upon the Land, and it warmed up, and the ice started to melt. And on this River was the village in which people lived, and it was called Eee-man-ghuk. The people were happy, and the River provided abundantly. They could hunt, fish and play upriver, but downriver belonged to the Raven and no one could go there. As things happen, there was a disagreement between two people, and the disagreement got worse, and the village divided. Those that were with one group lived on the Sunrise side, and those that agreed with the others lived on the Sunset side. Only the Shaman could speak to those on either side. Two of the children, a boy named Pee-tuk, and a girl named Ma-tiq had been friends since childhood. They always played together, and were together all day. But when the families of the village split, they ended up on opposite sides. Still, their friendship persevered, and when Womanhood came to the girl and Manhood came to the boy, they were still friends and wanted to be together, but the village would not approve because they were from opposite sides. So the lovers were very sad, and they tried to meet in secret now and then, but their hearts ached for each other, and one day their resolve steeled and they decided to take a boat and risk going downriver. One night, when the moon was setting, and the owls were singing, Ma-tiq and Pee-tuk met on the riverbank and took a small boat and paddled downriver. But the Raven saw them, because the Eye of the Raven sees all. And the Raven was angry and jealous, and planned his revenge. Ma-tiq and Pee-tuk paddled downstream, and the River got wider and bigger, and the water started to taste bitter, and they came upon the Big Water that the Shaman had spoken about. After they entered the Big Water, the Raven flapped his wings and a strong gale blew, and the boat was taken away from shore. The waves were big, and the little boat was so small. Ma-tiq and Pee-tuq were very afraid and they feared for their lives. Meantime, the Raven squawked overhead, in glee and joy. He shone stronger and stronger for them, and the waves did calm down, and the wind died out. After many days adrift on the boat, the sea was calm, the Raven could not be seen, and the boat drifted. Ma-tiq and Pee-tuq were very hungry and thirsty, for the little they had packed had run out. They could not paddle, for they could not see land, and did not know where to go. But one day, as they weakened, a land did appear, and they paddled towards it. And in time came to a shore of beautiful birds, furry animals, fruit trees of every kind, and clear, crystal streams of pure water. And when Pee-tuk and Ma-tiq got old, and their children, grandchildren and great grandchildren gathered around them, the lovers would tell them that they came from the First People, and that they were from the village of Eee-man-ghuk, that the Sun blesses all and that the Raven now must eat what people throw away.", "hit_ratio": 1.5855855855855856}, {"doc_text": "BRIDGEPORT, Washington (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Rodney Cawston\u2019s father and grandfather passed down stories of such abundant salmon fishing in the U.S. Northwest\u2019s Columbia River that the banks were a feast of red flesh. But Cawston, chair of the U.S. Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, has never seen fish harvests like those. He was born after the United States and Canada began construction in the 1930s of a series of more than 450 dams along the Columbia basin, which drains a watershed the size of France across seven U.S. states and one Canadian province. While the project was praised for generating electricity for the area and irrigating farmland, indigenous tribes mourned the loss of traditional fishing grounds but hope negotiations over a 1964 treaty governing the river could resolve this. The river and its tributaries border three sides of the Colville Reservation, a Native American reservation in the U.S. state of Washington. As the United States and Canada conducted a fresh round of negotiations this month in Victoria, British Columbia, to update the 1964 treaty - which can be terminated in 2024 - Cawston and fellow tribal leaders want to be formally represented in talks. \u201cWe have no representation even though our people have lived for thousands of years in this region,\u201d Cawston said, adding that the river\u2019s 15 U.S. tribes had seen their requests for formal representation at the negotiations rebuffed. Three Canadian tribes have also \u201crequested direct participation in the negotiations but to date have not reached agreement with Canada on that issue\u201d, said a spokeswoman for Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, chair of the Okanagan Nation Alliance. Canada meets with the three Canadian tribes before each round of talks and debriefs them afterwards, said a spokeswoman for the British Columbia Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum, which serves on the Canadian negotiating team. But Cawston said the upstream movement of fish was blocked by two dams along the river, Chief Joseph and Grand Coulee, the latter of which folk singer Woody Guthrie called \u201cthe mightiest thing ever built by a man\u201d in his song \u201cRoll On, Columbia\u201d. To mitigate for the loss of endangered salmon along the Columbia, federal agencies maintain and fund fish hatcheries, restore habitat and cull invasive predators. For example, one quarter of the reservoir of the Grand Coulee Dam has been set aside for local tribes to fish and hunt. And the tide is turning for fish losses this year thanks to favorable ocean conditions, with 1.3 million salmon and steelhead expected to enter the Columbia River in 2019 - according to the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife - compared to 665,000 in 2018. The 1964 treaty sets a protocol for managing how much water Canada will release annually from the river\u2019s headwaters and how much the United States will pay in return. Tribes hope the revised agreement will prioritize fishing by adding a third pillar alongside hydropower and flood control, the so-called \u201cecosystem-based function\u201d. This would \u201cprovide the right quantity of water at the right time to help fish migration and improve river conditions,\u201d said Greg Haller, executive director of environmental group Pacific Rivers. Demand for hydropower has decreased in recent years as California, once its biggest customer, adopts more solar and wind power, according to the Bonneville Power Administration, the federal agency that administers Columbia River hydropower. A 2017 study by environmental consultancy Earth Economics estimated improved management of the Columbia River could produce economic gains of $1.5 billion annually. Neither the U.S. nor Canadian negotiating teams would comment on river management in the revised treaty with talks ongoing. Despite the lack of formal participation, Cawston remains cautiously optimistic he might one day experience what his forefathers did. \u201cWith the renegotiation of this treaty, I really look forward to seeing salmon passage behind Chief Joseph Dam and Grand Coulee Dam,\u201d he said.", "hit_ratio": 0.6216216216216216}, {"doc_text": "Their world was divided into two moieties: Waang (crow) and Bunjil (wedge tail eagle). Members of the tribe identified with one or the other of these moieties and it was that which determined the pattern for marriage between individuals, clans and tribes and transcended local allegiances by obliging clan members to find spouses from some distant clan of the opposite moiety, either within or outside their own wurrung (language group). These included the Buthera Balug, located on the Goulburn, as far down as Yea and Seymour, the Look Willam Clan roamed the area on the Campaspe River, near Kilmore and Mitchellstown, the Nattarak Balug lived on the Coliban and upper Campaspe Rivers while the Nira Balug \u2018Cave People\u2019 bordered the Great Dividing Range near Kilmore, Broadford, Pyalong and westward towards Mt Macedon.

The Yeerun-Illam-Balug inhabited the area around Benalla and the Yowung-Illam- Balug lived at Alexandra, Mansfield and the Upper Goulburn River. They had an intimate knowledge of their environment and were able to sustain the ecology of the each region and exploit the food available. Within 15 years of that crossing most of the land in the area had been taken up by graziers. Their traditional society broke down and soon after, Aboriginal mortality rates soared as a result of introduced diseases, denial of access to traditional foods and medicines and conflict. At various times, Aboriginal settlements were established in the area by missionaries and governments at Michellstown, Acheron and Coranderrk (Healesville) however despite relative success were eventually dissolved.

Wrap both hands around the back of the leg (either above or below the knee) and extend the right foot up toward the ceiling. Pull the leg closer to the chest, and begin to rotate the ankle around in big, slow circles. Repeat for the left side. These stretches are important to help loosen up your lower back, hamstrings, hips, knees, and ankles. First, sit up tall with your legs draped over the side of your bed, and sit on your hands.

Connie, her naked flesh glistening in the glow of the ancient lights. Jimmy smiled wryly, slinking back into the bed. She moved her hands under the covers, making sure that he was ready to carry on. He was ready, and in a few brief, intense minutes the passion was out of them both as they sunk again into the mattress. The pocketed springs gave a last, long groan, and the couple finally fell into a happy, relieved slumber. It was but a brief respite. Outside, the hazy sky filled with thunder and a storm buffeted the construction of the house. The spittle of rain on the clouded-up bedroom window became steadily more intense, more regular. It also hid the sound of the lock clicking, padded footsteps pacing in through the bedroom door and the steady scrape of sharpened metal on the treads of the staircase. In quick succession: THWACK! Her eyes opened, and she saw the rain on the window. Rubbing her eyes, her ears now focused on the sound outside the door. He murmured again, and sleepily gestured her away. He shook, then got up out of bed. He found the door handle in the darkness. There was an electrical buzzing and, as he noticed the lights in the room had extinguished, his head turned. Before Connie could answer, the bedroom door seemed to fall open by itself. Jimmy\u2019s head turned, and, with a grunt of surprise, he saw Mrs. Chaldean, standing in the doorway. Connie laughed as Jimmy retrieved his clothes from the heap on the floor. He stood up, just as a muffled but distinct voice came through the door. His eyes returned to Mrs. Chaldean. In the gloom b y her legs, a black plastic sack, like those used for rubbish, flapped and crackled. Some low, light thuds echoed through the building as Mrs. Chaldean climbed the stairwell to the third floor, where her quarters were. Jimmy, breathless, looked to Connie. He climbed back into the bed. \u201cWe\u2019re out of here by eight tomorrow, alright?\u201d He growled. His eyes rolled to upstairs, as he heard a wheeze of a mattress, much quieter than the racket that Jimmy and Connie had connived to bring about. Jimmy gave a sceptical glance to the room, as if he could see something in the darkness, but shook his head. He felt drowsy and the pillows on the bed next to Connie looked much more inviting now. Finally, it seemed that the ghosts that lurked the corridors of Holman Hall would let their guests slumber. Jimmy slipped into the bed. The sheets crinkled. He felt Connie\u2019s warmth close by, and a hand wandered from his side toward hers, tenting the linen subtly, then meeting the taut flesh. Eyes closed, Jimmy smiled, and his tented hands fell flat on Connie\u2019s thigh, and wandered further in a well-rehearsed dance of the five fingers. He took another deep breath, about to make the final flourish of his act, but the breath stirred him in a way he didn\u2019t expect. In the dark his eyes screwed up and his naked shoulders rolled restlessly. He withdrew, feeling a tingling sensation in the back of his mind. Somehow, his eyes open now and glistening, he felt he was being observed by a force of powers unimaginable. \u201cWhat?\u201d Connie murmured, feeling the disturbance in the bed and the removal of Jimmy\u2019s hand. He waved, making a noncommittal noise, and let the drowsiness descend onto his dewy eyes, and fell into a perturbed, slumber, his arms like those of plastic figurines, cast closely to his self. She\u2019d been awake for a good while already but maintaining the pretence of sleep with closed eyes. She opened her eyes after the rattling carried across the room. Connie sat up, and the chill caught her skin, bringing out goosepimples on her naked breasts as the duvet fell with the same raspy sound that had kept her awake with every subconscious movement. Next to her, Jimmy murmured incomprehensibly as he stirred, his eyes opening slowly. He smiled, seeing her sitting in bed, gazing sleepily across the top of her goose pimpled frontage. Before she could reply, there was a clatter outside and the door to the room flung open. Quickly, Connie wrenched the cover up. About time you young things were up and out of that bed, I should think!\u201d Mrs. Chaldean trilled, drawing the door closed with a muffled thump. Connie threw the bedcovers off, despite the coldness that brought up her skin like a Christmas turkey. She looked out of the window, seeing sunshine in the sky but not feeling any of its warmth. Turning back, she saw Jimmy propped up in the bed. Jimmy finished dressing by pulling on a cardigan from the bottom of his backpack over his shoulders and opened the door. The dining room looked brighter than it did the night before, and as the couple trooped down the staircase, the sound of clattering cutlery against porcelain grew steadily louder, and the warm scent of a cooked breakfast wafted, meeting Jimmy and Connie midway down. Her eyes were drawn to the locked door of the reception room. In the morning sun the hallway was full of motes of hanging dust, disturbed only by the passage of the two guests toward the dining room. Her gaze on the door was broken only by the rattling of the dining room handle under Jimmy\u2019s hands. He corrected course quickly, for the second time in as many minutes. \u201cYes, lets,\u201d the landlady replied with a sigh.

Be sure there is no rat or roach poison anywhere in the house where the puppy can get at it, unless you are positive it is a kind that won\u2019t harm animals. If it is possible to fence off a small space in one room, where your pup can run and have his bed and drinkingwater bowl, this will save much wear and tear on the rest of the house. At least until the pup is housebroken! Well, let\u2019s say you have his bed in the kitchen, with a bowl of fresh water near. Next spread newspapers over the floor as the pup\u2019s temporary toilet . . . more about this in the Housebreaking Section. And here you come through the door, carton in arms, to introduce your puppy to his new home! So take him out of the box very gently. NOT by the nape of the neck, like a kitten. And NOT by his two front legs. The correct way to pick up a puppy is to put one hand under his chest and front legs, the other between his hind legs and under his belly. Let him get up and wander around his corner, sniffing at the newspapers. Then you can let him examine the rest of the house, but keep a sharp eye out to see he doesn\u2019t get into mischief. Watch the puppy carefully, talking to him in a low voice to tell him everything is all right. Then give him a drink of water and some of the food he had been used to eating at the kennels. After all, this is the first time he\u2019s ever been away from his mother and his brothers and sisters. Put this in a corner of the puppy\u2019s bed. He will curl up next to it, as if it were his mother\u2019s warm body. If you haven\u2019t such a jug, a warm brick is good. Its ticking will sound like the beating hearts of his brothers and sisters. When you read these next pages, you may suspect that you\u2019re going to be awfully busy with this wetting, chewing, hungry little animal that you\u2019ve brought into your house. Well, the truth is that until he\u2019s full-grown, you will be. But this busyness will also be fun, if you take the problems one by one. Most important, don\u2019t become frightened or nervous if you should forget to do a few of the things suggested here. If you skip one of his meals, or forget to give him a dose of cod-liver oil, don\u2019t worry too much. He may be a little hungry, but he won\u2019t get sick. One person in the family should do the teaching, so Beans doesn\u2019t get confused. Give him one end of a toy to pull while you pull the other, saying \u201cThat\u2019s it, Beans! Take a bit of biscuit in your hand and hold it out, calling \u201cBeans!\u201d at the same time. When he comes to you, give him this biscuit right away as a reward. Make a fuss over him. A loud voice only frightens a puppy. He will get the idea that you are either praising or scolding him from the tone of your voice, not from how loud it is.", "hit_ratio": 1.1944444444444444}, {"doc_text": "We stepped out of unrelenting daylight and into the shadows where, underfoot, tall grass and dirt coexisted with cheap carpet and shards of broken glass. Circumstances always contrived to remind me of her relative youth. I had been sixteen on The Day, and my family had taken vacations, so I remember hotels. This one was five stories tall and relatively well-preserved. The fires had spared it, and although the lobby was open to the elements the rest of the building was undamaged, pristine.

The beds were made and the sheets turned down, the gossamer-thin white curtains were closed but the blackout curtains were open enough to let light spill across the room. The bathroom was equally immaculate, with tiny soaps wrapped in paper, small drinking glasses wrapped in plastic. He gently closed the door behind them. She stood halfway into the room, waiting.

He dropped his pack into the armchair by the window, and climbed onto the other bed, kicking off his shoes as he went. He closed his eyes, but only for a moment. She was in his bed, next to him. Why not?\" He swung his legs off the bed, went to the window, peered out; still clear, still safe. He opened the blackout curtains a bit more, to let light into the room.

Cue my sleep schedule: On the weekdays, I fall asleep sometime between 11:30 pm and 12:15 am, and wake up at 6:30 am on Tuesday and Thursday for an early morning hip-hop yoga session. Then I snooze (and snooze and snooze\u2026) until 8:30 am Monday, Wednesday and Friday. On the weekends, I\u2019ll log an easy 12 hours per night on my pillow. I\u2019m lucky that I don\u2019t have any responsibilities that actually necessitate my waking before the sun rises, like a baby, early-starting office job, cat or partner. According to Chris Winter, M.D., medical director of the Sleep Medicine Center at Martha Jefferson Hospital in Virginia [in the US] and author of The Sleep Solution, it didn\u2019t matter what time I decided to wake up every morning, as long as it was consistent and allowed me to get a full night's rest. \"It didn\u2019t matter what time I decided to wake up every morning as long as it was consistent\"\nI asked Winter for some tips for easy wakeups and how to stop hitting snooze. He recommended a regular bedtime and suggested that I try some meditation or movement in the morning. Next, I would need to follow a morning routine that\u2019d keep me out of bed after the alarm went off. That meant that I needed to ditch the in-bed article-writing, Insta-scrolling, email-answering, and phone-talking. Not only did Winter suggest it, but some research suggests it could also help guide me toward a more balanced, active day. Plus, they were more active throughout the rest of the day. While I already typically log two-to-three hours of exercise per day, I figured morning movement couldn't hurt. On the first day, I set multiple alarms. At 6:50 am, the first alarm went off and, knowing that I still had 30 minutes of earned rest, I fell back into a deep sleep\u2026 until 7:00 am when the buzzer went off. By 9:30, I had completed my first workout, showered, had an on-the-go breakfast burrito and was stationed at the coffee shop around the corner from both my apartment and yoga studio ready to get down to work. So I went to bed pretty confident I\u2019d be able to repeat the results on Tuesday. But the walk to and from the bathroom made my feet cold, which felt like a valid excuse to climb back between the sheets. It was a little rattling, but a quick shower and spoonful-of-peanut-butter breakfast meant that I was back at my go-to java-shop by 8:30 am, even earlier than the day before. Sleeping in too late to flow in the am was a botch, but I got in a solid sweat in the pm so I\u2019d still rank the day a solid 7/10. But because I hit it (or should I say \u201cHIIT\u201d it) so hard in the gym that evening, when I got home I conked out by 10:30 pm. I heard my alarm, jumped out of bed and got to yoga with enough time to foam roll before class started. I had high energy levels for the rest of the day, only needing one cup of coffee, crushing my Crossfit WOD and generally feeling like an A+ early bird. \"I heard my alarm, jumped out of bed and got to yoga with enough time to foam roll before class\"\nThere was a company-wide meeting at 8:30 am, which meant I needed to be walking to the subway by the time my alarm would usually go off. I was up at 6:45 am and by 7:20 am, I was showered, fed and had even made my bed. Because the goal of this experiment was to wake up at the same time every morning, not to become a morning person, I felt like I had cheated. After a 10-hour work day, by the time I got to the gym, I felt like a zombie and basically slept walked my way through the workout. But I blame that on my skipped-breakfast, not my wake-up time. On the bright side, my late lunch meant I was well-fuelled for my workout. I conked out within minutes of hitting the pillow that night and was asleep by 11:30 pm. I felt delightfully well rested, but by the time I geared-up for the gym, I knew I\u2019d need to take an Uber to the box on time. I\u2019d rank my first Saturday of this experiment as a total fail: I overslept by almost three hours and had to pay to get to my workout on time. Which meant that I\u2019d physically have to get out of bed to turn off the tunes. After getting up to turn it off, I was up. I poured myself a cup of coffee, set up shop and was replying to emails by 7:30 am. By the time I got to CrossFit at 11:00 am, I had responded to 10-plus emails and drafted an article. Total weekend win. \"By the time I got to CrossFit at 11:00 am, I had responded to emails and drafted an article\"\nBy the end of my first week, I felt exactly the same. I appreciated the extra hour or so I had to respond to emails on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, but I had to switch which yoga class I went to on Tuesday and Thursday and sorely missed my usual instructor. Plus, because I\u2019d cheated the experiment and slept until 10 on Saturday, I was still able to log 12 hours of sleep one night of the weekend. I hopped back on the phone with Winter. Because I mentioned it was easier waking up when I had yoga to look forward to, he suggested that I find a yoga flow I can follow along with from my apartment when I didn\u2019t have a studio class scheduled. He also suggested that I try sleeping with the blinds open to see if the natural light would help me rise. \u201cThe goal is to help get your body into a routine, one sleep-in day doesn\u2019t make or break the experiment, nor will it get in the way of you reaping the benefits of mostly waking up at the same time,\u201d Winter added. Going into the second week, my goal to try to kick things up a notch with his advice. The night before, I only closed my blinds part way (instead of shutting them altogether) so that the light could help wake me up in the morning, as Winter suggested. I\u2019m on the second floor, so you can still sort of see into my room from the pavement, so I was hesitant about turning my room into a peek-a-boo adventure in the name of my experiment. Half-way open felt like a good compromise. Winter was right, I actually woke up naturally at 7:15 am. to the sunlight. I downloaded Sleep Cycle, a sleep app that works by monitoring your sleep and waking you up during the lightest phase of your sleep within a time frame that you get to set. My physical therapist Grayson Wickham, D.P.T., C.S.C.S., founder of Movement Vault, recommends that app for all his athletes, so I decided to give it a whirl. After, I felt much better and hopped on a stationary bike to sweat out some of the nastiness I was feeling. I felt guilty for logging those extra hours, but Winter assured me that it\u2019s actually okay to nap because I was still getting my body into the routine of waking up at the same time in the am. Plus, my body was working to fight off infection. The last two days of my experiment fell at the weekend, and truthfully, I wanted nothing more than to cut the whole thing short and sleep in past noon. Winter assured me that it\u2019s actually very common for athletes to require more sleep than the average exerciser, and while I\u2019m no CrossFit Games athlete, because I work out two hours per day, Winter said that I probably do need more than the eight hours of sleep per night. Although waking up at the random time of 7:20 am didn\u2019t drastically change my life (and, at times, it was actually pretty tough), I really enjoyed getting my work started so early each morning and it definitely made me feel more productive. Going forward, I want to stick with a relatively set sleep schedule and I have resolved to leave my snooze-button habit in the past. Still, I just can\u2019t promise I won\u2019t sleep in (at least sometimes) on the weekends.", "hit_ratio": 1.6296296296296295}, {"doc_text": "I wake up every morning with the intention of practicing, however, the fact that I don\u2019t wake up at a scheduled time, but do have to be to work at a scheduled time, means I don\u2019t always have an adequate number of minutes to dedicate to a morning practice.

So my son and I developed a routine of lying on the couch watching morning cartoons and eating toast. It looks like while the Gro Clock is by far the most popular option, in the States, the Ok To Wake Up Clock by Mirari is the go-to option. Like the Gro Clock, it features different colours for night and day to teach your toddler when to wake up. The nighttime mode shows an image of stars and a blue light while the morning mode shows a sun image and a yellow screen. The idea is that you teach your toddler to stay in bed until the sun comes up each morning. The Gro Clock website suggests starting to use the clock for toddlers 2 and up. However, I started using the clock with my daughter at around 18 months and with my son at about 17 months. If you purchase a Gro Clock, it will come with a storybook to help explain the clock to your toddler. However, by the time we were using the clock on our second child, the book had vanished, and I taught my son about the clock without its help. What we did do was practice saying hello to the stars every night before bed. Then in the morning, I made a point of saying hello to the sun on the clock. While it is so tempting to put in a wake-up time of 7 am and call it a day that\u2019s not how a toddler alarm clock works. Start by setting the alarm for your toddler\u2019s earliest wake-up time. What you\u2019re aiming for is for the clock to be in morning mode when they wake up. Then, once they are used to seeing the sun every morning (for us it took a few weeks) then start changing the wake-up time VERY slowly. Increase the time by 5 minutes at a time or at the most 10 minutes until you\u2019ve reached a reasonable wake-up time. While your toddler is learning about using a sunrise clock, it is so important to be consistent. Make sure that at bedtime you and your toddler are watching the clock change to its nighttime mode. Your toddler may wake up before their scheduled wake up time. Some mornings you may have to go into your toddler\u2019s room before their scheduled wake up time. When you do go into their room make sure you subtly manually change the clock to the morning mode. Then, before you get your toddler out of their crib comment on the clock. I would always make a point of pointing at the sun on the dial and saying something like \u201cLook! Do you need to use a reward chart? While the makers of the Gro Clock suggest using a sticker reward chart while your toddler is leaning I never have. I avoid reward charts like the plague, mostly because I always seem to run out of steam when using them. However, if your toddler loves sticker charts and is not catching on to the alarm clock concept, then it\u2019s something you could try. I\u2019ve even had a few mornings where I\u2019ve forgotten to set his clock, and I\u2019ve had to go it and get him at 7:15 because he\u2019s just happily playing in his crib waiting for the sun to come up.

It helps align the spine, keeping the vertebrae from twisting during the night and reducing pressure between the legs and knees. If you have sleep challenges like sleep apnea, research shows that by keeping you sleeping your side, a pillow between the knees can reduce the amount of times you stop breathing during the night. While you should still consult your doctor for a proper treatment method, a pillow between the knees is often recommended. A woman\u2019s body is home to a growing baby, and it needs all the support it can get\u2014from pillows and a restful night\u2019s sleep. Putting a pillow between your legs can align your spine. A pillow between your knees can also release tension in the lower back, preventing muscle pain upon waking and during the day. And as stated above, it keeps you balanced laterally and reduces the amount of times you stop breathing if you have sleep apnea. Make sure your head is pillowed too. If the pillow under your head is too tall, you will lose all the benefits of sleeping with your spine aligned. There are a variety of pillows on the market to help you sleep with your spine aligned.

It was a large and heavy, black, leather-bound bible. Did it mark the path through the family that this bible had taken? As if answering my mental question, Dad told me that the Bible had been acquired in the 17th Century and passed down through several generations of the family. That family was now extinct. It had died out with the recent death of the old lady who had given Dad this bible for safe keeping. It\u2019s age, the smell of the paper, the strange typeface used, the binding and leather cover that was embossed in a strange design. It was a mysterious book in many respects.

It started with creaks and groans, unexplained bangs and crashes from the attic. \u201cJust the heating and cooling of the rafters,\u201d my Dad told us reassuringly. Added to some of the other things that I was experiencing at the time, it meant I hardly slept through fear.

I wasn\u2019t the only one hearing these sounds every night and I met my father on one or two occasions armed with flashlight heading up the vertical pull-down ladder into that little square hole in the roof at the top of the stairs. He was investigating those sounds although mostly he just muttered something about me getting back to bed. Imagine if every night it sounded like some one or some thing was slowly moving around your attic amongst crashes and creaks, sighs and groans. The hairs stood up on the back of my neck hearing those sounds as the cold hands of fear seemed to clasp around my neck slowly strangling me. No noises that night nor the next or the next. In fact, the noises were gone and never returned.

A time between the departure of the Romans and the beginning of a new era of Norman occupation. It was during this time that a church was built on a slight rise near the river. Begun on the foundations of an old Roman building, the church that rose from this spot is today known as the oldest church in London. And is a virtual time capsule of the history of London\u2026as well as an excellent place to wait out a springtime thunderstorm. The first thing that struck me was the windows. I\u2019ve never seen anything quite like them. Uniformly laid out across each window were the coat of arms for various people, military units, and guilds that have had an association with the church at one time or another. For example, an original Saxon archway built sometime between the 7th and the 11th century, still remains intact in the church of today. Leaving the main nave and descending into the crypt, you find yourself walking in the footsteps of the Romans as you encounter original floors from a 2nd century house that once sat where the church is now. Moving through the narrow passage of the crypt, Saxon arches stand solidly overhead as you moved through the foundations of the 14th century church. Along the way are relics discovered in the foundations of the church and now put on display int he crypt museum. During the rebuilding of parts of the church after World War II, a portion of a Saxon cross was unearthed from the 9th century. It now sits in the crypt as part of a larger exhibit. Down in the crypt, the sound of the thunder from the passing storm outside was all but silenced. As I walked over the uneven paving stones, past Roman floors, it felt as if London\u2019s layers of stone and dust had peeled back to reveal the London of old underneath. Not only does All Hallows contain Roman and Saxon relics, there is also an underground chapel in the crypt that has an alter dating back to the Crusades. The stones of the alter are from a Crusader castle in Israel. It was believed to have been carried on crusade by King Richard II, a son of the Black Prince and King of England in the late 14th century. Because the church sits just beside the Tower of London, it also served another use during the Middle Ages. It was to this church that the remains of victims of the Tower Hill executioner were brought for temporary burial. In the 17th century, the church tower helped Samuel Pepys view the raging fire that swept through London from Pudding Lane, just missing the church itself. As I descended back into the main church, the rain was letting up and the thunder was rumbling further in the distance. I stole a few moments more to sit on one of the pews and soak it in. Sitting in the silence, with the gentle patter of raindrops on the payment outside was very peaceful. Something about knowing that everything surrounding me had survived from another age was reassuring.

Or you may have noticed that your home isn\u2019t sitting quite right on the earth it was built on. Let\u2019s say you didn\u2019t have a hand in the construction of your house, and you have no idea how it was built. What you may not know about your house and how it\u2019s built is that the type of soil it\u2019s standing on has a huge impact on how stable the foundations are, as well as how your house deals with moisture and times of flooding. Understanding the interaction between your house and the earth it\u2019s on, as well as the different types of soil your home is built on will help you repair it the best and most efficient way possible. Before going into the different types of soil you can find, first let\u2019s go into the science of how soil and your home\u2019s foundations interact with each other. As the layers increase, the more the soil is able to bear the weight of the structure constructed on it. However, the hardest parts of the earth underneath it are very, very deep. What you should be more concerned about is the so-called active zone, or the layer of soil your house and its foundations are sitting right on top of. That active zone is directly affected by the weather and climate in your area, and different kinds of soil comprising the active zone will, in turn, directly affect your home. You obviously wouldn\u2019t want foundation settlement to happen, as it could damage your house at the very least and destroy it at the extreme worst. Loam \u2013 The most ideal type of soil for your foundations, loam is made of a mixture of sand, clay, and silt. The downside of loam is erosion, which may leave the soil unable to support the weight of your home and its foundations when it happens. Rock \u2013 Usually referring to sandstone, limestone, bedrock, or other kinds of rock, this type is the most solid and doesn\u2019t absorb moisture at all, making it a good material to support foundations. Clay \u2013 One of the most common soil types around. Here\u2019s the thing about clay soil: you don\u2019t want to use it for shallow foundations (when you\u2019re adding rooms, for example) because in extreme temperatures, the soil can get either too wet, expanding the soil, or too dry, shrinking the soil and allowing more space to let water in. Because of this characteristic, sand or gravel is ideal for drainage systems and foundations in general so long as water doesn\u2019t wash the soil out. Silt \u2013 This type of soil has particles somewhere between the size of sand and clay, and it absorbs a lot of moisture. When it retains moisture, the soil swells up against the foundations, damaging them and making areas like the basement damp. Its softness obviously makes it unstable to build any foundation on, and if the soil around you is peat, you need to avoid it at all costs. Our foundation repair team is one of the finest in Chattanooga, and we\u2019re ready and well-equipped to analyze the soil around and under the crawl space of your home and explain to you how we can fix it.

And then I realised; this is the point of balance, the stillness, the moment when all time stands still. Before this\u2026 The ritual I assisted at was preceded by an hour long obstruction instead of the preparation time expected. Finally I stood still in confrontation without that overflowing of the oceans which spill themselves as tears. I surprised myself by remaining calm, drawing on the stillness that resides within. Things began again \u2013 the darkness rising, the winter coming. Right through to the Night of Fireworks. It should come as no surprise that the wheel is too huge to change direction in just one night. And now we are sinking into the darkness. The time when stillness is more important than ever. The time of reflection, while the sun gives us space to breathe and go within, while the land recovers and asks us to rest and heal our bodies. Can I spend more time in the stillness? Can I say No to some of the activities which present themselves as opportunities? To gather strength for the spring which will follow winter as surely as the cold is filling the land. My mind turns to thoughts of the dead, ancestors of blood and spirit. My altar shifted and now reflects the song of the dead whispering on the winds, the deep water, the cauldron of the night. This winter I will be seeking stillness. In the chaos of life. In the endless activities and the calm carved from the storm. I can only act well when I come from a place of stillness, from a rested place, a place where I gather my energies. Reflection. Meditation. Musing.

These internal or external struggles are important to attend to in our lives and you\u2019ll have a better measure of success this Full Moon when you remember that in darkness you can utilize different senses than sight to gather information with. When the field of vision is dimmed some become hyper-aware of inner sensations and immediate physical stimuli while others tap into a collective consciousness, a global awareness that can feel overwhelming in it\u2019s vastness or protective in its anonymity. While these perspectives are different neither holds greater currency in the journey of awareness in the dark. Whatever resource comes to you, embrace it, celebrate it, wash it down with wine and cheese, exploring in the dark requires a lot of energy. The dark doesn\u2019t last forever, let the tides of feelings and emotions swell and warm you, they will always recede again.

Several hours in the small kitchen cooking pancakes, blending a smoothie, assembling supper in the crock pot, and scrambling a big lunch together in between a trip to the bustling Farmers\u2019 Market and executing an afternoon excursion had stolen every last bit of energy I had left. I splashed my face one last time luxuriating in a soft towel before stepping across the bathroom to the window. My ears were not playing tricks on me. A familiar sound for me, but a displaced sound in this dry California valley: the soft pattering of raindrops! I was skeptical, especially when the forecast only predicted a forty percent chance of falling water. We\u2019d never seen rain in California before, so I motioned them out of bed to witness the historic phenomenon outside their window. I tip-toed back to my room, terrifying the cat in the process. I\u2019m sure we confused her, these strangers who invaded her fortress every summer and kept unpredictable hours. As I pulled the warm duvet over my shoulders, I noticed the gentle dripping was already gone. Only the soothing trickle of the neighbor\u2019s deck fountain remained to keep me company. Just as I had predicted, it was merely a cruel taste of the elusive rain that California is so parched for. My eyes flew open to stare out the window into the semi-darkness. There it was, the glint of a thousand raindrops against a streetlamp. I love sleeping to the sound of a distant thunderstorm and smiled in the darkness. I tucked her back in and relaxed in the rain-washed breeze. I decided to leave her as long as she was oblivious. Just as I drifted back to sleep, another flash of lightening and clap of thunder jolted me awake. The fan fell silent and the world was plunged into blackness. Through the cracked bedroom door, I watched a dim glow appear, fade, then grow brighter. My mommy-brain told her to shush, grabbed my phone and fumbled for the flashlight app as I leaped out of bed to confront whatever horrifying creature was entering my bedroom. I shook my head impatiently at my stupidity and calmly stepped into the living room and shined my light around. I carried it to the bathroom counter where it cast a cozy glow that extended into the bedroom. I traversed the darkness again to check on Missy and smiled to see her peaceful face, eyes still closed in oblivion. I was tempted to wake her up and carry her into the bedroom so I could avoid another trip through the dark house (how many times had I tripped across the Lego bucket in the living room in a single night?

I pulled the cover back, and two big dark eyes stared right into mine. Both boys were wide awake from the booming thunder, so we curled up on my bed and conversed in hushed tones about the storm. I reminisced about living in a metal-roofed trailer when I was ten and described to my own boys the noise that would ensue every time we\u2019d have a thunderstorm, which happened on a regular basis in southwest Missouri. They asked about flash floods, and we discussed dams and man-made lakes until I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes open. The noise of the thunder was moving away, and I shooed the boys back to bed to finish out the night. I could still hear the steady drumming and dripping of rain on the roof and trees and rushing through gutters. Pans rattled and spoons clanked in the kitchen. Tea time, only this morning it had to be done the old-fashioned way: boiling water on the stove.

He was ready, and in a few brief, intense minutes the passion was out of them both as they sunk again into the mattress. The pocketed springs gave a last, long groan, and the couple finally fell into a happy, relieved slumber. It was but a brief respite. Outside, the hazy sky filled with thunder and a storm buffeted the construction of the house. The spittle of rain on the clouded-up bedroom window became steadily more intense, more regular. It also hid the sound of the lock clicking, padded footsteps pacing in through the bedroom door and the steady scrape of sharpened metal on the treads of the staircase. Her eyes opened, and she saw the rain on the window. The frame was rattling in the wind. She took a breath, beginning to sit up. Rubbing her eyes, her ears now focused on the sound outside the door. He shook, then got up out of bed. He found the door handle in the darkness. The handle rattled but didn\u2019t move. There was an electrical buzzing and, as he noticed the lights in the room had extinguished, his head turned. Before Connie could answer, the bedroom door seemed to fall open by itself. Jimmy\u2019s head turned, and, with a grunt of surprise, he saw Mrs. Chaldean, standing in the doorway. Connie laughed as Jimmy retrieved his clothes from the heap on the floor. His eyes returned to Mrs. Chaldean. In the gloom b y her legs, a black plastic sack, like those used for rubbish, flapped and crackled. Some low, light thuds echoed through the building as Mrs. Chaldean climbed the stairwell to the third floor, where her quarters were. Jimmy, breathless, looked to Connie. His eyes rolled to upstairs, as he heard a wheeze of a mattress, much quieter than the racket that Jimmy and Connie had connived to bring about. Jimmy gave a sceptical glance to the room, as if he could see something in the darkness, but shook his head. He felt drowsy and the pillows on the bed next to Connie looked much more inviting now. Finally, it seemed that the ghosts that lurked the corridors of Holman Hall would let their guests slumber. Jimmy slipped into the bed. The sheets crinkled. He felt Connie\u2019s warmth close by, and a hand wandered from his side toward hers, tenting the linen subtly, then meeting the taut flesh. She hummed, and he hummed too, taking a deep breath of her essence. Eyes closed, Jimmy smiled, and his tented hands fell flat on Connie\u2019s thigh, and wandered further in a well-rehearsed dance of the five fingers. He took another deep breath, about to make the final flourish of his act, but the breath stirred him in a way he didn\u2019t expect. \u201cWhat?\u201d Connie murmured, feeling the disturbance in the bed and the removal of Jimmy\u2019s hand. He waved, making a noncommittal noise, and let the drowsiness descend onto his dewy eyes, and fell into a perturbed, slumber, his arms like those of plastic figurines, cast closely to his self. They stayed there, stiff and immobile, all night. She opened her eyes after the rattling carried across the room. She took a shallow breath. Connie sat up, and the chill caught her skin, bringing out goosepimples on her naked breasts as the duvet fell with the same raspy sound that had kept her awake with every subconscious movement. He smiled, seeing her sitting in bed, gazing sleepily across the top of her goose pimpled frontage. Before she could reply, there was a clatter outside and the door to the room flung open. Quickly, Connie wrenched the cover up. About time you young things were up and out of that bed, I should think!\u201d Mrs. Chaldean trilled, drawing the door closed with a muffled thump. Connie threw the bedcovers off, despite the coldness that brought up her skin like a Christmas turkey. She looked out of the window, seeing sunshine in the sky but not feeling any of its warmth. Turning back, she saw Jimmy propped up in the bed. Jimmy finished dressing by pulling on a cardigan from the bottom of his backpack over his shoulders and opened the door. Connie, despite her scorn, couldn\u2019t fail to smile, just a tiny bit. The dining room looked brighter than it did the night before, and as the couple trooped down the staircase, the sound of clattering cutlery against porcelain grew steadily louder, and the warm scent of a cooked breakfast wafted, meeting Jimmy and Connie midway down. Her eyes were drawn to the locked door of the reception room. In the morning sun the hallway was full of motes of hanging dust, disturbed only by the passage of the two guests toward the dining room. Her gaze on the door was broken only by the rattling of the dining room handle under Jimmy\u2019s hands. Shaking her head, she followed. \u201cTwo, what do you\u2026\u201d he began to protest, but felt a pain bolting across his shin.

The decrepit house was his only inheritance from his mother, who passed away during his time in an underground cell. He returned to the house in its sorry state, and rather than waste his pension on its upkeep, he embraced its weathered character for his new life. An ambitious soldier turned hardened writer, he was able to work from the comfort of his overstuffed, wing-backed chair, basking in the warmth of the grand fireplace of his study more often than not, only venturing outside to deposit the occasional brown-paper parcel in the box on his fence containing his pseudonym works for his editor. One night, after a glass of neat scotch and another chapter finished in his current project, the man ascended his winding staircase and retired to his bedroom for the night. As he lay in his bed, he was tormented by sleep that refused to last, tossing and turning between dreamy haze and frustrated consciousness. Rolling over once more, he heard a creak in the wooden floor coming from downstairs. He dismissed it quickly, and pulled the blankets up closer to his face. He rolled over to face the door, eyes open now, heart beating a little faster in breathless anxiety waiting for another sound. Silence lingered for what felt like an hour, and just as he started to close his eyes, a whining creak cut through the night as something from below was approaching up the staircase. He had no weapon in here, and although the hero in many of his works would have bravely thrown open the door to face whatever trespasser made the mistake of disturbing his sleep, the thought of this confrontation made his stomach churn. As quietly as he could, he slithered out of bed and crept towards his door. Firmly pressing one hand against it, the other gripped the lock and turned it slowly until the soft click cut through the silence like a discarded bullet casing. The present silence echoed loudly throughout the halls. From under the bed he could see black shadows beyond the small crack below the door. After what felt like an eternity, he squinted open his eyes and looked out to the space beneath the door. His heartbeat slowed, and he climbed out from beneath his mattress to stare blankly at the door before him. He decided it was, and buried himself under the covers of his four-poster bed. Wrapped tightly in a cocoon of blankets, he stared at the door wide awake, waiting until the safety of daylight to venture out into his home. As fresh sunlight cascaded through his windows and filled his bedroom with a warm energy, a new sense of confidence arose in him. He got out of bed and unlocked his door, pausing at the handle to take a deep breath before flinging it open. No trail on the floorboards in the foyer. He went downstairs to find all of his windows closed and locked as they normally were, his front door the same. His day passed like any other, and before he knew it the sun was slowly fading into twilight, leaving the sky a deep crimson with streaks of purple clouds like curtains about to unveil the evening\u2019s show of twinkling lights. As he sat by his fire, a worn novel in his lap and petite glass of brandy on the table beside him, the exhaustion from his previous night\u2019s episode started to set in, and he felt his mind drift as sleep cradled him in its arms. There was a knock at the front door, and he jolted upright, very awake. He got up and walked through the hall to the foyer, but hesitated. Maybe he was just hearing things again like last night. The knock repeated. He pressed his face against the door, looking through the peephole to see a woman draped in a hooded black robe that extended the full length of her frame to lightly brush against the porch with the gentle breeze. He considered her for a moment, then turned back the padlock and pulled up the floor stopper to open the door and face his uninvited guest. Upon first glance, what he could see of her face seemed slightly gaunt, with wispy strands of black hair lightly concealing her left eye and poking out around the sides of her neck. Her right eye was opened wide as if in a state of permanent surprise, the deep brown pupil dilated to a thin disk. Her nose was crooked as if it had been broken and not healed correctly, her lips the color of distressed mahogany. His gut told him to slam the door shut and just walk away, but there was an indescribable, strangely familiar aura about her that entranced him, keeping his feet glued to the worn wooden entryway. A dense fog hung over the dimly lit street, blanketing most of the neighboring homes. This woman was unfamiliar to him, but he was sure the Esthers lived in the house at the opposite end of the development. She stared at him blankly for a moment. Although he rarely ventured outside the safety of his walls, he felt inexplicably reluctant about sending her on her way alone. Of course, she was only a stranger and just moments ago he wanted nothing more than to retreat into the safety of his home behind the thick wooden door and wait for whoever this was to pass on. He held open the door as she stepped inside, black cloak dragging across the welcome mat through the entrance way as he silently led her to the study. He left her by the fire as he walked to the foyer closet. He bent to pick up his loafers and turned back to the entrance of the study to find her silently staring at him. She was standing on one foot, the other raised beneath her cloak with her knee protruding slightly. Her arms were extended high above her head, with her hands drooped so they formed two claws. She met his gaze silently, as lightning outside flashed through the window, casting an elongated demonic shadow across the floor in her wake. His mouth fell open in shock as she slowly inched closer to him, her one foot still in the air beneath the cloak while the other dragged at the ground in a piercing screech, like iron nails grinding against the wood. He turned ghostly sallow as he recognized the sound from the night before. His shoes dropped to the floor from his trembling hand. Turning away from her, he bolted across the foyer to his back kitchen, scrambling up the narrow service staircase at its rear to the second floor. He took refuge in his bedroom and locked the door shut behind him without hesitation. He grabbed the telephone and after a brief ring, he was connected to the local police station. He slammed the phone onto its receiver and turned back to the door straining to hear any sounds of movement. He heard the same familiar scratching noise against the wooden floor, and soft thud as she reached the first rise on the staircase. Heart beating out of his chest, he dove underneath the bed for lack of a better plan. Creaking footsteps approached toward his bedroom up the stairs and finally reaching the landing. He heard again the familiar dragging scratch across the wood floor leading toward his hideout, until she reached the door. Reliving the horror of the previous night amplified by a thousand, he jerked his gaze away from the door as he heard her softly exhale before scratching her nails down his door. Suddenly, the scratching stopped and there was a deafening silence. He glanced to the space under the door, and saw no shadow waiting behind his wooden shield. Crawling on his hands and knees toward the door, he pressed his face against the crack below to gain a better view of the suspiciously deserted hallway. Carefully he rolled back the lock and opened his bedroom door. The landing was clear as he walked slowly towards the master staircase, peering over the railing to gaze at the entranceway below. He walked down the stairs, and approached his front windows in time to see a cloaked figure gliding down his street. Suddenly filled with an unfamiliar courage, he opened the door and lightly jogged out after her. He had to stop her from getting to the Esther home. As he moved through the fog-laden street, he saw her approach the house at the far opposite of his own, ascend the porch stairs and let herself in through the unlocked front door. He followed across the front lawn of the Esther house, and approached the living room window to peer inside. All he saw was darkness, save for a light coming from the second floor. He glanced to the ajar front door and thought for a moment before slowly entering. The cops would be right behind him, he reassured himself, as he stepped into a stranger\u2019s home to chase after the specter that terrorized him the past two days. He inched toward the staircase and the light emanating from the floor above. He carefully climbed the stairs and glanced across the upper hallway to the light coming behind another door left ajar. Still no answer. He walked to the door and lightly pushed it open. Lying on a blood-soaked bed was the body of a woman-the woman that visited his home on two separate occasions. She was naked and there were deep slashes across her chest, her arms tied to the bedposts behind her head, hands dropped downward to form crude claws. Her right foot was twisted grotesquely, as if she had tried and failed to escape prior to the horrors that followed. He became lightheaded and felt bile rise in the back of his throat. Pale and sweating, he ran down the stairs and out the open front door to land sprawling on the neatly kept lawn. A high-pitched ringing filled his ears and blocked out the sound of everything around him. Red and blue lights flashed on the ground before him as two police cars pulled up in front of the sinful house. A uniformed man walked him away from the house and the horror within towards the cruiser, speaking inaudibly to him over the persistent ringing in his ears. He climbed numbly in the back seat, and watched the Esther house steadily fade to black as he was ushered away into the foggy darkness.", "hit_ratio": 3.5765765765765765}, {"doc_text": "She yanked me upright, threw the beer can somewhere, dragged me to her beat-up old car and threw me inside.

Only the lonely palms swayed like dancing slaves around its dominating figure as the wind began to pick up. Inside, the quiet stillness was not expected and the air smelled of old wood. An unfamiliar electricity clung to the hairs of our bodies. The decor was dated yet modest, dusty yet protected from the harsh tropical weather due to the ship's dense exterior.

At their door, the woman asked if they would need anything. The woman nodded in understanding, and then descended the stairs. Sam gently closed the door and turned to look at the room. The room didn\u2019t look bad. Aside the bed, there was a table by the wall and a lamp on it. The bed was well made and the sheets were clean. Cynthia stood by the wall, with her arms wrapped around her. Sam smiled at her. With time, she would see that there is nothing to fear. Cynthia saw that Sam\u2019s mind was made up. She walked towards the bathroom, to take a look at it, while Sam threw the bag on the bed and opened it. Cynthia rushed out of the bathroom as Sam closed the door and descended the stairs. She walked to the door and pulled it open. She was not going to stay alone in the room. Instead of the stairs, a brick wall stood before Cynthia. She stepped back into the room, looking around her. A portrait hung on the wall, by the bed. Cynthia stepped to her right and watched the woman\u2019s stare move with her. Terrified, she walked backwards, further into the room. On her shoulder, a drop of blood fell, followed by two more. She slowly turned around. Her terrified scream never left her lips. Cynthia fell to the ground, a pile of charred flesh. On the stairs, a new painting appeared with Cynthia\u2019s face on it. He stood in a hallway longer than the house could possibly accommodate. Down the hallway, a baby cried from one of the rooms within the house. \u201cHello!\u201d Sam called as he walked down the hallway, toward the cry. Along the hallway, Sam found vacant rooms with open doors and blood stained walls. The cry of the baby became louder. He got to the room and found it open too. Inside the room, a woman attended to the baby. She turned and stared at Sam coldly. He noticed blood drip down the woman\u2019s neck and looked closely. He bent down and shifted it to the side, then stood erect to look at the woman. The woman and the baby were gone. Sam walked further into the room, confused. He turned back towards the door and gasped. The woman stood before him, with the baby in her arms. Sam looked at the door, then at her. She looked up from the baby to Sam\u2019s face and smiled coldly.

The plane was only about half full and due to the late departure time most everyone would be sleeping, everyone except Jack. He watched solemnly as the city lights disappeared and he felt the plane level off at cruising altitude. The attendant brought him a drink and he tossed it down then asked for another. She smiled and trotted away, returning a few moments later with his request. Sam. What the hell was she thinking? Did she really expect him to play this stupid \"follow the leader\" game without a fight? He knew that to be fact, had known it for years. Why was she suddenly ready to throw that away? They'd been so glad to be together that the subject just hadn't come up. They'd spent their days in bed, at the park, had taken in a movie and even had dinner with a mutual friend that was stationed temporarily in Washington. Nothing out of the ordinary and so he had assumed the argument was finally over - settled, history. He hadn't mentioned SG1 and neither had she. Jack poured his second drink and swirled the liquid mindlessly around the glass. This wasn't an Airforce jet that would streak across the skies nonstop and reach the base in a few hours. He struggled in the small space, trying to stretch his legs, trying to find a comfortable position. Finally, he shifted his mind into combat mode, the one that allowed him to sleep anywhere, the one that allowed his physical machine to rejuvenate and his mind to rest even though part of him remained ready and alert. He laid his head back against the seat, ignoring the discomfort and concentrated on sleep. Suddenly the air around him stirred slightly and he grasped the hand on his shoulder almost before it touched him. Jack looked at his knees pressed against the seat back and started to stand. He settled in and a few minutes later fell into a dreamless sleep, exhausted from his work and the added stress of trying to solve a problem he didn't really understand. A light snow drifted silently to earth around him and the brisk air felt refreshing against his face. Even in first class, it had been a long flight and for the first time that he could remember he wasn't excited to be home. He stepped quietly onto the porch and slipped his key into the lock. A small sigh of relief escaped him as the key turned easily unlocking the door and dispelling the barely recognized fear that she might have changed the locks. At least she hadn't taken that step yet, hadn't barred him from her life completely. He moved down the hallway and pushed gently against the bedroom door where Sam was sleeping. Her arms were wrapped around the pillow, as she cradled it against her head, her face relaxed and her tousled hair falling randomly across her face. She was tired, exhausted, otherwise he would never be able to sneak up on her like this. Oh, she slept soundly when she was home, a direct opposition to her sleep on missions, but still aware and waking at the slightest sound. He fought against the urge to brush the hair from her face and kiss her cheek, finally stepping silently into the bathroom. He brushed his teeth and undressed, hanging his uniform haphazardly on the hooks on the door. She'd hate that, but it was the least of his worries, right now. He was tired and he needed her, his emotions were alternating between wanting to feel the comfort of her against him and dreading the rejection if she pushed him away. Those thoughts brought back the anger, the pain he'd experienced as he opened that damned envelope and he quickly forced it to the back of his mind, locking it away, if only temporarily. When he returned to the bedroom she had turned on her side and her bare leg was now dangling over the edge of the bed, her arms free of the pillow and relaxed at her sides. That persona had slipped away, hidden in sleep, replaced by the beautiful creature that he loved so completely. Slowly he moved to the bed and gently lifted her leg, placing it back onto the bed as she moved slightly against his touch. He paused and smiled when she didn't awaken. With all the stealth he could manage, he slipped into bed beside her, careful not to touch her or rouse her from sleep, hoping to avoid any confrontation until morning. He stretched out on his back and relaxed into the pillow as the comfort of the familiar bed caressed his body, then he closed his eyes waiting for the shelter of sleep to engulf him. Her arm moved around his waist, tugging slightly as he lifted his arm to make room for her and she nuzzled her face against his neck. She wasn't awake, but had sensed that he was there and in sleep sought the comfort of his embrace. Pulling her against him slightly, he pressed a soft kiss on her forehead. Suddenly he realized that Sam's hand was moving across his chest, her touch slow and gentle. When it stopped, he covered it with his own, squeezing gently and a slight smile tugging at his lips. He held up his left hand and wiggled his fingers, indicating the ring that rested there. \"I know you got the papers, Jack.\" He looked down, away from her eyes, feeling pain and anger beginning to replace the thrill of waking up beside her. He caught her eyes again before he spoke, making sure his voice was soft and free of the anger he felt. \"I think you owe me an explanation, Sam. What the hell is going on?\" He pulled her slightly closer and allowed his hand to stroke the soft skin of her arm as he waited. A bit of frustration slipped into his voice and he saw something flash across her eyes, something he didn't quite recognize. \"I have to go to work, Jack. His voice was still soft but Sam recognized the determination coloring it and knew he meant what he was saying. \"I have to shower and get dressed.\" She turned and walked out of the room, leaving Jack alone and more confused than ever. He heard the spray of water as the shower came to life and pushed up from the bed, slowly standing to his feet. Running his hand through his hair, he crossed the room and pulled on a pair of sweats and a tee shirt. He glanced at the bathroom door, then at the clock on the nightstand and started down the hall to the kitchen. He moved efficiently about the kitchen, making coffee, toast and eggs. He was almost finished when she appeared in the doorway. She smiled slightly and moved to pour them both a cup, leaving his beside the pot as she moved to the table and sat down. She looked down, wrapping both hands around the cup and pushing her chin forward. I can't get to Washington, you can't get home and...\"\n\"Everything just feels wrong, messed up...\"\nJack sat the pan back on the stove and moved towards her but she was already standing up to move away. \"Sam?\" She stopped and turned towards him. \"I'm sorry, I have to get to work, Jack.\" He followed her to the door watching as she pulled her jacket on and reached for the door. He almost yelled as his frustration overwhelmed him. She turned towards him and was surprised at the pain reflected clearly in his dark eyes. She looked down and fiddled with the zipper of her jacket, knowing that she was hurting him and hating herself for it. Finally looking up again with a faint smile, she tried to lighten the situation. Turning quickly, she reached for the door but he stopped her, his hand covering hers as she grasped it. \"Sam?\" Their eyes locked for a long moment and he could see a deep sadness that he'd never seen before and then the beginning of tears as she looked away. \"I'm sorry, Jack, I have to go!\" She tugged the door open and went through it hurriedly. Then he slammed the door forcefully and cursing softly, walked away.", "hit_ratio": 2.630630630630631}]}}

She sacrificed her life by using the Silver Crystal to send the court of the Silver Millennium, including the spirits of her daughter, the Solar System Senshi, and her daughter's lover Prince Endymion, into the future to be reborn on Earth. She described herself as being the incarnation of the Moon goddess Selene. In the anime, Sailor Moon, Sailor Mercury, Sailor Mars, Sailor Jupiter, and Sailor Venus all ended up on the Moon when Kunzite attacked them at the North Pole with a dimension/temporal attack. Once there, they found the ruins of the Moon Kingdom. They made contact with an image of Queen Serenity who explained the history of the Moon Kingdom and then sent the Sailor Senshi back to the Earth. Serenity returned the Silver Crystal to Usagi, merging it with her Transformation Brooch (thus creating the Crystal Star), and also gave her the Cutie Moon Rod. In the manga, when the Inner Senshi and Luna went to the Moon in Act 10, they went into the ruins of the palace, and there found the Holy Blade near the Crystal Tower, inside the Chamber of Prayer. When the sword was removed from the palace floor, the image of Queen Serenity appeared before them, saying that her essence resided in the computer databanks in the ruins of the Moon Kingdom, allowing her to speak with them. She told them all of the past, and how the people of the Moon had long lives, given to aid their mission to protect the Silver Crystal, while at the same time watching over Earth and guiding it on a good path. Queen Serenity told them of the machinations of Queen Metalia which had led to the downfall of the Earth, and the deaths of Prince Endymion and Princess Serenity. Serenity then told them that the dark power was reviving, because in her grief of losing her daughter, the seal she placed on Metalia was imperfect. She explained to Sailor Moon that she had to use the full power of the Silver Crystal to destroy the dark power; because the Crystal would follow her heart, she must believe in faith, unity, and love. Before she ran out of power, Queen Serenity told Sailor Moon to remember to live as a young woman because that was why she was reborn on Earth, and asked the other Senshi to protect Sailor Moon and to bring honor to the kingdom. She granted the respective planetary castles to Sailor Neptune, Sailor Uranus, and Sailor Pluto upon their birth. She likewise instructed Pluto on the responsibilities of her role as the guardian of space-time, informing her of the three taboos of her station: traveling through time, abandoning her post at the Space-Time Door, and stopping time. When they fought Queen Nehellenia, the Sailor Senshi learned that Queen Serenity first encountered her during the celebration of Princess Serenity's birth. Nehellenia had infiltrated the Moon, living deep within it, and though Serenity welcomed her so long as she sought peace, it was not to be. Queen Serenity used the power of the Silver Crystal to seal Nehellenia into her ornate mirror, within which the Queen of the Dead Moon dwelt until encountering the Sailor Senshi. After Eternal Sailor Moon saved the galaxy by resetting the Galaxy Cauldron and dispersing Chaos, Guardian Cosmos revealed that when Queen Serenity died, she returned to the Galaxy Cauldron. Queen Serenity assured Luna that things would be sure to work themselves out in due course, but warned her of a dark presence that was trying to awaken. She appeared again later, when Luna and Makoto were concerned about how to deal with the growing threat of Queen Mio. Queen Serenity sent them the Legendary Sword, which she called the Spirit of the Senshi, in order to revive the Senshi's powers. Her dress was different than that of her anime and manga counterparts, and unlike them, she also wore a crown. In the Sailor Moon musicals, Queen Serenity was played by Jaimie Natsuki, Yuka Kobayashi, and Mai Shiraishi. In the manga and anime, Queen Serenity wore her hair in exactly the same odango style as her daughter. In the opening sequence of the first five episodes of Sailor Moon Crystal, Queen Serenity had blonde hair and dark blue eyes, but as of the opening for Act 6 she appeared with white hair and grey eyes.", "hit_ratio": 1.2252252252252251}, {"doc_text": "Several fittings just like lighting fixtures, your furniture, in addition to decor will have to be preferred properly as with Garden Knomes image gallery to generate a fabulous glimpse.

About the only thing we're going to distort is the size of her mouth. Making her mouth smaller and pushing it up closer to her nose will make her nose look larger and make her chin look longer. With the facial features pretty well placed, we'll now draw her chin and the sides of her head to enclose her face. After that, we'll tackle the hair and any finishing up we have to do. Basically, defining the size and shape of the head is done by drawing the chin first, then drawing the contour of one side of the jaw, then the other side of the jaw. Then define the hairline, and in defining the hairline, the forehead becomes the space between the hairline and the eyes. Finding where to draw these contours to define the face is pretty subjective in caricature, if you want to draw a really fat face, you put the contours of the face miles apart. If you want a skinny face, you'd put the facial contours really close to the outside edges of the eyes. On the photo of the woman, with your pencil, measure from the bottom of her nose straight down to the bottom of her chin. If you take that measurement on the photo, and place one end of it horizontally at the outside corner of her left eye. Does that put the other end of the measure right about at the tear duct of her right eye? So on your drawing, measure from the right tear duct to the outside corner of the left eye. Turn that measure 90 degrees and put it at the bottom of the nose. See where the other end of the measurement falls, and lightly put a mark there. Now draw a curved line that represents the contour of her chin. Now we'll draw the sides of the head, and do the left side first. On the right side of her left eye, put a dot a bit less than half an eye away from her left eye. This is the edge of her head. Now, all you have to do is draw a curved line that follows the contour of her face from that dot to the chin line you just drew. Follow the contour of her face carefully. For the right side the same process will work, let's start the contour line parallel to her right eye, and let's mark it at her hairline, which is much farther away from the eye than the other mark was. I see her hairline is about an eye width from the corner of her right eye. So, find her hairline at about an eye to the left of her right eye, then bring that measurement in a little bit to make her face narrow. See in the image to the right where I originally put the mark, then moved it in.

In the photo, at the widow's peak, there's a lock of hair that creates an arched shape that falls to the right, that lock of hair continues down past her eyes. Draw a curved line starting at the widow's peak and draw it down along the contour of the face, bowing it out at the eye. Make some hints as to the direction of the hair with shapes made of grouped lines, and fill in the two darker spots with shadow and line. Don't worry about measuring the shapes in the hair to make them correct size, just eyeball the sizes you create with the lines and shadows. To the left of the right eye is another dark shape that encloses the ear. I keep drawing lines and shapes that follow the direction of the flow of the hair and I work my way up and around the top of the head and then work my way down the right side until I come to that large dark shape by the right ear. In the photo, the right ear is concealed by hair and only the lobe and an earring are visible. Just draw the earring, and shade the entire area all the way to the side of the face so you don't even have to draw an ear. Draw a vertical line at her jaw representing the side of the neck. Continue and draw contours of the shirt she's wearing. A little trick I do when drawing hair is not to draw shadow shapes all the way to the hair contour line. This gives the illusion there's a light shining behind the head that highlights the hair. It gives the caricature a tiny bit of a \"photographic\" look.

Lee-a-lei's mouth parts stirred, and her long proboscis uncurled. \"They're vestigial,\" Lee-a-lei intoned, holding out a knife with one of her six claw-like hands. She ran the sharp blade along the crease between Lee-a-lei's hard carapace and the soft flesh of her wing. The blade came away gummy, and the wing crumpled to the floor like a discarded scarf. Lee-a-lei stood now before Maradia, strangely diminished. Her body hadn't changed, but the lack of her bounteous wings made it seem to have. Segmented arms and armor-like carapace, dozens of wiggly mouthparts nestled at the base of a long curled proboscis, and antennae that moved about restlessly above giant multi-faceted domed eyes -- that's all she was now. Lee-a-lei twirled about, stretched out her segmented arms and danced like a nightmare come to life. Lee-a-lei hesitated, antennae rotating, and for a moment Maradia thought she might get stiffed on this job anyway. This was the part Maradia was comfortable with: she lifted the pair of robotic wings, constructed from ultra-light alloys, and affixed them to Lee-a-lei's back.

The metal wings were a common expression of Maradia's skill as a roboticist; Lee-a-lei's organic wings had been a marvel of biology.

The breeze still jostled the curtains and blew the fabric across her arm. She pushed the wooden chair to the window.

In the daylight, the glass shimmered in the sun; when darkness fell, night lights peeped from several windows, camouflaging lives existing behind hollow shadows.

Once the other leg dangled over the ledge, she searched the sky. Stars beckoned. The moon gazed.

The sun danced across her lace dress as she swanned towards the artist, her movements flower-like and gentle. She thought the painter might think it was nice, she was always likening her to flowers. Something that Basil had said to her, on a sun-kissed evening, not more than a week ago, had stuck and replayed often in her head. No matter which angle I should paint you from you will always remain exquisite.\u201d Dorian had smiled at the time, but she was now struck with a slight melancholy. The pink petals matched the flush of her cheeks. Basil looked up from sorting out her paints and smiled at the girl, her eyes widened slightly and she hummed in approval, \u201cThat could be interesting. Come, come!\u201d The painter rushed past her and back into the warm garden. Dorian gave a breathy chuckle, and followed her through the tall, gold trimmed doors. Her sapphire eyes glistened in the sun's rays and she squinted, waiting not more than a second before she became accustomed to the light. A bee buzzed past her, hesitating near the flower on her ear before moving on to a clump of lilac foxgloves. She sat down on the dry, spring grass and motioned for Dorian to do the same. \u201cHere, come, sit!\u201d She patted the ground next to her quickly. The corners of Dorian\u2019s lips pulled upward, betraying her sparked interest, she did love when the artist became excited, it showed a quite different side to her usual reserved nature. She moved over and flung herself down on the grass next to Basil. The painter seemed to hesitate, \u201cDo you mind lying your head on my lap? Basil let out a breath of laughter, \u201cI think you are probably right, Dorian.\u201d She looked down at the young girl, suddenly filled with a rush of admiration that burned through her, lighting up her cheeks with a pink glow. She carefully moved Dorian\u2019s hair so that it was lying over her legs, the tips brushing the ground. A bumblebee danced near them, humming through the rainbow of flowers that calmly leaned side to side in the light breeze. The constant drone of London seemed to be more distant than usual, the two women were under a different sky. A sky that seemed to reflect a foreign sea, the soft transparent clouds, like small fish under the surface of the waves. Dorian decided that this background complemented the artists face well, her black curls contrasted the light of the day, her olive eyes mixed with the aquatic blues of the sky, reminding her of the seaweed that coated the grey rocks of a summer beach. Her pale pink lips were quite a likeness to the wisps of clouds, they looked like a brushstroke of rouge against the pale canvas of the artists face. The light shone through the painters locks, leaving shadows that chased each other over Dorian\u2019s ivory face. The darks of her pupils reflect the sun's rays, making her eyes turn a lighter shade of blue until they were quite like diamonds. Her soft, scarlet lips were slightly parted and Basil felt the young girls breath mist her arm as she entwined the stems of the roses through her golden curls. The painters fingers moved in artistic strokes against Dorian\u2019s skin. Dorian let her eyes fall shut and rested her focus on the feeling of the slender hand working it\u2019s delicate art through her hair. Everywhere it went, Dorian felt as though it left a trail, she could feel the lines the artist had traced on her even after her hand had moved on to expertly braid another flower through her locks. Her breath hitched as Basil\u2019s hand grazed her rose flushed cheeks to stroke a stray curl of gold behind her ear. \u201cNo.. It\u2019s not that.\u201d Dorian mumbled, crossing her porcelain arms over her chest. The painter squinted down at her, smirking at the almost petulant look on her face. Basil smiled in amusement but obliged with her wishes, hesitating before smoothing her long fingers over the ivory curves of the younger woman's face, tracing down the edge of her chin and onto the soft arches of her neck. Dorians breath trembled as the artist grazed over the dimple of her throat, then down against her collarbone. Her expression was different now than it was in any of the portraits she had drawn before. She answered to every touch and thrill of the bow. There was something terribly enthralling in the exercise of influence. Her scarlet lips were parted like the petals of a blooming rose, Basil thought that she would like to drown in the sweet pink of them, but quickly dismissed the thought. The artist explored her neck with flower-like fingers, caressing the soft skin that resigned there, observing the girls reactions. She felt that the girl would be her masterpiece as she brushed a finger up the centre of Dorian\u2019s neck and her delicate eyelids fluttered slightly open. Basil finished braiding the flowers through Dorian\u2019s hair, they formed a sun-kissed pink crown atop her forehead and mixed beautifully with the golden rays of her curls. \u201cOh Dorian, roses compliment you perfectly!\u201d Basil gasped, awestruck by the girls radiance. \u201cThank you, Basil\u201d The girl hummed, \u201cDo you think we are ready for painting now?\u201d The artist hesitated, not wanting to move from this spot, from this perfect moment. Dorian rose and straightened out her clothes, before offering her willowy hand out for the painter. Their eyes met, each of them searching for something in the others, some sign that what was about to happen, should happen. She had not noticed the difference in height between them until now that they were so close, it was slight, but Dorian still turned her face up to see her. The light caught her eyes perfectly at this angle, the shades of blue rippled like a river with slivers of silver dancing under the shallows. The tip of Dorian\u2019s tongue slipped out and ran over her bottom lip in one swift motion and Basils breath caught in her throat. Basil froze as Dorian\u2019s hand went to the back of her neck and she moved further into the kiss. The world spun around her and she tightened her grip on Dorian\u2019s hand as she felt she might faint or choke or both. A sickly happiness grew in her stomach and it was all so much and it was perfect, this was perfect, Dorian was perfect. The younger woman tentatively tasted her way around the artists mouth, exploring every line and curve. Her teeth tugged lightly at the artist\u2019s lip as she pulled back, still close enough for Basil to feel her shallow breaths on her skin. Her mouth brushed against the curves of the artists lips as she leaned into the chalk scent of her skin. The artist felt Dorian\u2019s hand begin to slide up her leg and she quickly grabbed it before she could go any further. She didn\u2019t care about her reputation or Dorian\u2019s, they could both be dragged through the mud for all she cared, all she wanted was this, this perfect moment, and she just wanted to be able to enjoy it today without worrying about tomorrow. She brought them up to her lips and placed soft, lingering kisses on the younger woman's hand. The look on Dorian\u2019s face told her everything she needed to know, it was okay, they would be okay. She closed her eyes, letting her worries and doubt wash further away with each wave of Dorian\u2019s breath. \u201cExcuse me, ma\u2019am, but it is nearing 2 o\u2019clock, would you like me to set the table for-\u201c Parker trailed off as he stepped through the door, realizing he had probably interrupted something. Basil saw a contagious smirk pass Dorians face, causing her to give a soft laugh. No, in fact, you can take the rest of the day off, Parker. \u201cThank you, ma\u2019am, very kind of you.\u201d Parker turned and left the girls alone in their embrace.

Smoothing out the striped navy blue and yellow silk with its embroidered Club crests, he rolled the tie half way up his shirt, then unrolling it, pressed it down on his belly. He made his way to the front of the reception hall that was filled with tables covered in white cloths, ornate flower arrangements and candelabras, till he got as close as he could to the head table. There he pulled out a chair and sat down to wait for the bride and groom, as if he were part of their family. He was, as usual, too early. He hated being kept waiting himself, and so he made a point never to be late. But no one in Nairobi\u2019s high society appreciated the finer aspects of his character, his sense of propriety and his polished etiquette. Dr Patel sighed, caressing the silky fabric of his tie, from the knot to the bottom. He was glad he\u2019d decided to wear it, even though the famous crest and stripes design was never recognised and no one had ever asked him about his membership with the Club. A few more guests arrived and they huddled together around a table at the back of the room, a group whose wealth, businesses, friends were all inherited. It made them take for granted those things which he had worked for. He hadn\u2019t inherited the position of Head of Human Resources at Amber Investments, he\u2019d earned it day in and day out for twenty years, and he\u2019d even worked on Saturdays. But he\u2019d outgrown his friends\u2019 company and the new acquaintances did not give him the respect he deserved, and often did not even remember him. The eldest son had recently been bequeathed several hundred acres of agricultural land by his father, and he shook hands with everyone at the entrance and at the back table, saying hello to a man there, waving to so and so, patting this uncle on the back and kissing that aunty on the cheek, and smiling at no one in particular. They were followed by the Shahs, reserved and unsmiling as they walked to the front of the hall, cloaked in their multi-generational wealth. \u2018I\u2019m sorry these are reserved for the family,\u2019 replied Dr Patel. The couple looked at each other. The man pulled out two chairs and they sat down. Dr Patel was sure they were not related to the groom. The woman\u2019s dress, even to his inexperienced eye, was unfashionable and drab in its cut and design and as for the man\u2019s trousers, worn so high around the waist, he hadn\u2019t seen anybody wearing a gaudy belt like that since the seventies. And so here he was, closer than family. \u2018Are you family?\u2019 asked the man with the belt. Dr Patel reached into his pocket and took out his card holder. He gave one to the man and another to his wife. \u2018Those who know me well call me Doctor.\u2019 Dr Patel put away his wallet and took out his new phone. He frowned and shook his head to indicate he had just received an important message. Dr Patel looked at her with a semi-raised eyebrow. \u2018I have my gift here,\u2019 he said, taking two crisp notes from his wallet and putting them in the envelope. He added one of his business cards, licked the flap and pressed it down with his short fingers. \u2018I believe I do,\u2019 the woman said, producing a gold biro from her bag. Dr Patel noticed a look pass between the man and his wife. He wasn\u2019t sure why, maybe he had embarrassed them with his generous gift? The woman turned away from him. Dr Patel leaned back in his chair and picked up his phone again. He was sure his relaxed manner, as he prepared his gift, had made them feel awkward. They must have spent a long time deciding what to give, and he had been able to do it so easily, so generously. Two more couples Dr Patel had met before made their way to the table and when they introduced themselves, he handed them his card. \u2018We\u2019ve met before,\u2019 he said. The couples half smiled at each other, pulled out their chairs and sat down. Dr Patel poured himself a glass of water and took a sip. But no one had ever said, \u2018Ah yes, Dr Patel, I remember you. We met on the 4th of February at the Khans.\u2019 He remembered every one of them as he repeatedly handed out his business card, and he despised them for their weak memories. Then the conversation turned to the latest scandal. A priest at one of the temples had taken an overdose and left a note: \u2018God has finally acknowledged my life\u2019. \u2018What a profound man he must have been,\u2019 said the woman. Dr Patel stared at his empty plate and fingered his tie. The waiters came around with the starters: chicken tikka on skewers, tawa fish, king prawns, samosas and mutton kebabs. Wine was flowing like water, as was the champagne, and here he was right in the middle of these rivers, at ease with the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of Nairobi society. How he loved these sounds, the tinkle of expensive cutlery, the low sophisticated chatter and the classical music from the sitar and the tablas played by the highly paid musicians in the corner. Dr Patel looked down at the musician seated on the carpet. He recognised the raag Kalyan melody always sung at weddings and raised his hand in a benevolent way. \u2018Wah, wah,\u2019 he said. The man made a salaam in return, and Dr Patel beamed. \u2018Aren\u2019t you going to eat anything, Doctor?\u2019 asked Gokul. \u2018I\u2019m a vegetarian,\u2019 replied Dr Patel. \u2018I don\u2019t take alcohol,\u2019 Dr Patel answered. Shifting his eyes away from the vulgar belt around Gokul\u2019s middle, he picked at random a man in a grey suit at a nearby table and waved. When the waiter came, Dr Patel asked him for a small salad and a glass of water. The men gave each other furtive glances, and the women looked down and smiled. Dr Patel guessed they were shamed by their own decadent and indulgent eating habits. He pressed his huge belly closer to the table, drank a dainty sip of water and dabbed his chins with his napkin. Then came speeches and wedding jokes which Dr Patel had heard many times, followed by the clinking of knives against glasses, with shouts of \u2018Kiss the bride\u2019. Amidst the frivolity around him, Dr Patel struck a particular pose he had perfected, one of serious contemplation. He looked up when he realised one of the women at his table was talking to him. He stared in bewilderment at her moving lips. \u2018Have you come alone, Dr Patel?\u2019 she repeated. Even after two decades, she hadn\u2019t learnt the art of subtlety and she hampered his style. \u2018Yes, I\u2019m alone,\u2019 he mumbled. \u2018An urgent matter has come up at work,\u2019 he said. \u2018Please excuse me.\u2019 He stood up, the starched napkin falling from his lap, and stumbled through the crowd to the exit. In a daze, he reached his car, took off his tie and flung it onto the passenger seat. He drove until he came to a fork in the road and halted at a traffic light. When the lights changed, he put his foot on the accelerator and instead of taking the road to his right which took him home, he took the left turning towards a roundabout. \u2018This is my true friend, Dr Patel,\u2019 the groom\u2019s father had said, with his arm around him, when he\u2019d introduced him to his friends. The affection was a clear signal to everyone that he was just like them. Dr Patel swung his car round again. What envy he\u2019d seen on the faces of that shabby couple when he\u2019d put the money and his business card into the envelope with the shining golden logo of Amber! They had no flair, no panache, but he had risen from that same world of unsophistication through his own initiative, and now fitted in with the most successful in society. He rolled down the window and let his arm rest on the ledge. He felt the cool wind in his face as he drove faster round the island. He lived in leafy Lavington, in a three bedroomed house with a heated swimming pool and a sunken bath tub and he drove a four wheeler Forester. He sent his children to private school, and his family had annual holidays abroad, in Europe and America. And that was not all, he\u2019d even found himself a mistress. He had the complete lifestyle. Of course people talked, but that was the point. He was good enough for two women, his wife and a younger woman willing to be with him, on his terms. Dr Patel swerved the car. He parked in the empty car park and decided to wait until he saw other people enter the apartment block. He usually made a point of seeing his mistress at a time when everyone was coming home from work. He\u2019d alight from his car holding his phone to his ear, and lean against the door with a pre-occupied air. Initially, the neighbours used to nudge each other and snigger. This gave him much pleasure, while he remained intent on his phone conversation. His reputation as a virile lover had been established. Rolling the smooth silk between his fingers and then unravelling it again, he held up the strip of cloth in the dim lights of the car park. Oh, how beautiful it was. He had had to have it especially made because he wasn\u2019t an actual member of the Club. He laid it flat on his thigh, stroked it and placed it lovingly back on the seat. He noticed a young couple waiting at the entrance so he hastily slid out of the car and joined them. There was no answer, so he knocked again. She stood in the doorway dressed in a black lace negligee, satin gown and high heeled slippers. Her hair fell around her shoulders silky and smooth, and as she tilted her head, something glinted in her nose. Strange, he hadn\u2019t noticed the ring before. She stepped aside to let him pass and shut the door. Dr Patel waited in the corridor. \u2018It\u2019s very late,\u2019 she said, pulling her gown closer, and fumbling with the belt. \u2018I think you should leave,\u2019 she said.

As he entered the lift, a slim, clean-shaven, young man was exiting. \u2018Good evening,\u2019 he said. \u2018Dr Patel, I presume?\u2019 The man was dressed in faded blue jeans and a white t-shirt. \u2018I notice you\u2019re not wearing your famous Club tie tonight, Doctor?\u2019 Any other time, Dr Patel would have been flattered, but he frowned and made no acknowledgment. He went down to the car park and was puzzled to find the car unlocked. He must be more careful. He drove back to the roundabout, swinging around it at full speed. To Nairobi society, he was Afshan\u2019s lover, and tonight like any other, he\u2019d visited her and been just himself. Tonight most of all he\u2019d needed her friendship, but she hadn\u2019t understood. He circled the island one more time. He thought how Gokul had asked several times if he was feeling all right. Dr Patel had squinted at his salad and poked the lettuce leaves as if lost in thought, yet all the while he\u2019d listened intently to the easy banal chit-chat from which he\u2019d been excluded. He reached for his tie absentmindedly, but felt only shirt buttons. He turned to the seat beside him, fumbled where he must have left it, and then felt near the hand brake, but there was no sign of it. The lights changed to green. Accelerating, he swerved the car towards the apartment block again, parked in the same spot as before and alighted from the car. Using his phone as a torch, he flashed it here and there, but could not see his precious tie anywhere. He drove back to the island and veered towards home, oblivious of the red lights he was skipping. When he reached the gates of his mansion, he stopped. He sat there drumming his podgy fingers on the steering wheel and switching the headlights on and off, again and again. Of course, the young man in the lift had admired Dr Patel\u2019s car on his way in and noticed the Club tie on the seat. Dr Patel laughed aloud.

A heart attack at the rich age of eighty-three. McDonald's, you better hope I don't wake up. \"Excuse me, sir,\" a small voice filtered into my slightly-drooping left ear. Suddenly the tangy stench of disinfectants assaulted my nostrils. I could hear the beeping of vital-checking instruments. Slowly I opened my eyes and squinted to where the voice came from, \"Who are you?\" Or a midget with an abnormally small head. \"Tony, but my mommy calls me Little Tony.\" The boy warily popped his head higher into my vision. He was the color of dirtied white chalk with dark blue eyes. \"I'm Mayor Alec Warren,\"\nTony's eyes went wide with shock. My laugh and smile were reassuring to him. \"Na, kid, it's fine,\" I said through my raspy chuckles. He smiled back, eyes bright. \"So what can I do for you kid?\" He frowned now and glanced down, and then back to me. \"I can't find my mommy,\" he sniffled. I frowned too and sat up against the backboard of the hospital bed. The joints in my old elbows popped loudly. \"Alright, well I can't do much lying in bed,\" I told him. Slowly turning, I pressed the red intercom button to speak to the nurse. It's buzz startled me and my heart lurched a little. \"Am I in trouble?\" I shook my head definitively so I didn't have to turn. \"No, I just gotta tell my guard to get in here to help you.\" Finally the intercom buzzed again and the tired female voice filtered through. I asked her. \"No,\" she paused. \"Are you okay sir?\" \"I'm great actually, but a little kid stumbled in my room looking for his mom.\" His over-sized black Tonka truck sweater looped over red sweatpants. \"Oh, alright, uh, I'll send an officer up,\" the nurse at the receptionist's desk answered after a moment. \"Thanks darling, have a good evening,\" I told her. \"What time is it?\" \"Just a little before midnight sir. I thought was reasonable enough. \"Okay thanks, have a good one.\" \"You to sir,\" she answered and clicked off. Tony looked like he had walked out of a slum. \"Is your mom a patient or doctor or nurse or something kid?\" He sniffled and wiped his little nose on the back of a small hand. \"Before the car hit us she said we wouldn't have much of a Christmas anyways,\"\nOh no, I thought as my heart squeezed violently. Get out of bed and exert, exert, exert! Someone whisked the screaming boy into the air. A sharp and cold needle was driven into my arm and I could see the face of an angel above in a halo of bright lights. The moon was shining it's cold warmth through the blinds. \"Hello?\" Immediately there was the rustle of magazine pages and two large footsteps. He smiled and let out a breath of gratitude. \"Sorry about earlier,\"\nI shook my head laughed, the pain was finally gone completely from my chest. \"Flirting with the nurses huh?\" He frowned now and my own laugh dissipated. \"No, I mean about the kid,\"\n\"His depressing story was what got to me, but I'm fine now.\" I paused. \"What time is it?\" \"About four sir,\" he pulled at the triangular black goatee. \"Did Tony find his mother?\" I asked. \"Who?\" he furrowed his eyebrows. His eyes widened. \"Oh,\" he paused, \"I have no idea. I was worrying about you the whole time, not the kid.\" I sighed and shook my head, \"Is there anyone still here who knows where the kid is?\" \"Doctor Carl,\" Kareem suggested. \"That is good, so how is she?\" \"Not good I'm afraid,\" a thick voice said out of nowhere. Kareem tensed and looked up at Dr. Carl. The fat man had a clipboard nestled between his expansive gut and sagging chest. She can't pay for the operation, and insurance sure as hell can't either.\" \"What operation would that be,\"\n\"We need to give her a new kidney, it was pierced by the shifting gear.\" Dr. Carl scratched at what little hair he on either side of his head with a free hand. \"Ms. Lucas leaned over to protect her son and was impaled. My sigh was deep. \"Shame, a real shame,\" Kareem shook his head and looked at the ceiling. \"I'll pay for the operation myself,\" I told Dr. Carl. Both Kareem and the doctor looked at me, shocked. \"Sir?\" Dr. Carl wheezed. \"You heard me, I'll pay for her operation. I'm too rich anyway,\"\n\"It's pricey,\" Dr. Carl warned with squinted eyes. \"I'm the very rich mayor of this town. Now do as I say or lose your job on the spot,\" I chided him. \"Do we understand each other?\" He nodded and hurried out of the room. I looked up at Kareem, who wore a bemused smile on his face. \"Well aren't we all righteous tonight?\" \"When you rule your own small town and actually care about the people, you'll understand.\" After dressing in a green and red sweater- with a frightening resemblance to Freddy Krueger- and jeans, I asked Kareem to find the kid again. He nodded and left quickly without a word. I didn't have to wait long until my guard gracefully quick-stepped his way to me. \"He's sound asleep sir, I didn't think I should wake him. A hot receptionist told me he'll be just fine though, she's watching after him.\" I nodded. \"You have got to get yourself a girlfriend man,\" I teased and laughed at him. He laughed to and nodded vigorously.\" \"I guess I do,\" he rasped through chuckles. \"Glad your fine Mayor,\" she said with a tired smile. I smiled back. \"Tell Dr. Carl to give me updates on the surgery of a Ms. Lucas,\"\nShe nodded an affirmative. \"Sure thing, these chairs aren't that comfy sir. I suggest at least going home,\"\nKareem groaned softly behind me. I turned to him. \"I really think you should get home,\" he told me. Get some sleep and come back later,\"\nHe eyed me sternly for a long moment. Finally he left me standing at the receptionist's desk. Curly and long with various shades of gold. \"I'm sorry to wake you sir,\" it was a woman's soft voice. Barely above a whisper. \"No, it's alright. What time is it?\" I asked, blinking and squinting in the sudden sunlight. The waiting room was empty except for me, Kareem I could see in the corner of my vision, and this blonde woman. \"About one Mayor, you've been out longer than me.\" Her smile still didn't leave and she nodded. \"I'm really sorry for the trouble he caused,\"\nI laughed at such a preposterous idea. \"Two heart attacks is all I'll get. Kids are worth it though,\"\n\"Yes, yes they are. Especially Tony,\" her voice dropped and her face glowed as she stared off to my left. \"I don't know how I can I thank you enough for helping with the operation.\" \"I just feel so bad by making you pay for it...\" her voice trailed off. Turning my body towards her, I gripped both of her red sweater shoulders. \"Don't. I'm an extremely rich man, your operation didn't even put a dent in my account. I'm just so glad he didn't get a scratch,\"\n\"He was being watched by a real angel. And if I may be brutally honest,\" I suggested. She shrugged and nodded again. \"You look like an angel this fine morning,\"\nShe laughed and turned red in the face. \"You're his guardian angel though,\"\nI just smiled a little and nodded. She wasn't going to take no for an answer. \"You know,\" she paused, her voice cracking. \"Right before the crash he told me his Christmas wish,\" tears flowed through her eyes again. She ignored them and let them flow freely. \"He wanted one Christmas, for the first time ever,\"\nI nodded and told her to continue. She did. \"And while I was unconscious, I swear this sounds so weird. \"Well your alive now, fulfilling his wish. We need more folk like you in this town.\" I paused and thought. \"Ms. Christmas.\" I hugged her tight and she cried into my shoulder, mumbling her thanks inaudibly.

With the next two generations of Intel's chips set in place, the company is looking forward to a low-power future. And Intel has also completed the design for Nehalem, a more radical overhaul of the company's chip blueprints. The more interesting news was Otellini's goals for Intel over the rest of the decade. The company plans to ship a generation of processors on its 45-nanometer manufacturing technology by 2009 that come with graphics integrated right onto the processor, similar to what rival Advanced Micro Devices has planned for its Fusion chips. And as expected, Intel talked up its low-power chips for MIDs (Mobile Internet Devices), with plans to reduce the power consumption of its handheld computer chips by a factor of 10 compared with the Silverthorne processor, expected next year. That appears to have three legs: first of all, don't squander the base market of PC and server processors. The hope is that this prevents AMD from catching it napping and losing significant chunks of market share, which is probably the best description of the years from 2002 to 2006. Intel ships more graphics technology than anybody else on the planet, but that's only because it ships so many low-cost integrated graphics chipsets in desktops and notebooks, not because that graphics technology is extremely compelling. Historically, Intel's integrated graphics products used older manufacturing technology too antiquated for cutting-edge processors, but that's changing. In 2009 Intel will ship a processor that has 45nm graphics technology built onto the chip, and in 2010 it will introduce a chip for which both the CPU and the graphics technology were designed for the 32nm manufacturing technology slated for production during that timeframe, Otellini said. And for the high end of the market, and possibly the discrete graphics market currently owned by Nvidia and ATI, Intel will produce a processor called Larrabee with many configurable cores and a shared cache memory. Intel wants to be part of whatever design becomes the most popular mobile device. Having shed its ambitions for mobile phones, it now plans to compete directly against the smart phone industry with the MID, sort of a handheld notebook PC that hasn't really attracted much interest as of yet. There's no evidence at all that people want MIDs right now, but Otellini thinks that if Intel continues to reduce the power consumption of its chips, the designs and software for MIDs will continue to improve. Those devices will have to connect to the Internet somehow to compete against smart phones that use cellular networks for voice and data. And Intel thinks that network will be WiMax. The company is working with Sprint and Clearwire to get WiMax service going in the U.S., and it will hit Japan with WiMax as part of its joint venture with KDDI. So that's what Otellini said. As always, it's interesting to note what he didn't say. Keynote speeches later today from Pat Gelsinger and tomorrow from Dadi Perlmutter and Anand Chandrasekher might clear up some of those questions, but it's always interesting to see what the CEO's priorities are during one of his biggest speeches of the year.

Our mission is to get laptops in the hands of children; it doesn't necessarily have to be our laptop.\" He added that Intel's move does not spell out trouble for OLPC, because \"The world is big enough for us combined \u2013 and more.\" Associates thought differently. He said that the downfall of OLPC is that it fails to recognize it must operate with a sharp business model in order to succeed in its idealistic goals. \"[OLPC] is not really clear on what it takes to produce massive quantities of these things, deliver them and then support them in the field,\" Kay said in a phone interview. He explained that Intel has the advantage in this regard, because in selling 500,000 low-cost notebooks to Portugal, the company is creating a market for such devices. Thus, more Original Equipment Manufacturers will want to work with and provide for Intel, a company that understands how to operate a business, as opposed to OLPC, Kay said. \"Intel has very long range view of how they develop a market, and that's what they're doing,\" Kay said. \"It's competitive; this is how competitive companies operate, they have a goal.... They adjust to realities of the situation; they bring in partners; they come up with marketing strategy and campaigns.\" However, OLPC's president said his organization is satisfied that a new market has emerged as a result of its efforts.

The potential settlement would call for banks to provide financial assistance for homeowners who experienced foreclosure or are in danger of losing their homes. It also would require banks to overhaul their mortgage servicing and foreclosure practices as well as include a component for \"principal write-downs,\" the reduction of mortgage debt for individual homeowners. Gaining California's support for the deal would be a significant accomplishment for the administration, which in recent weeks has been trying to step up its aid for the beleaguered U.S. housing market.

Up to 90 per cent of sunflower starfish in parts of Howe Sound have died from an unknown wasting epidemic in the last month and Vancouver Aquarium scientists are trying to solve the mystery. Donna Gibbs, a research diver and taxonomist with the aquarium, said she got into the water at Bowyer Island and near Porteau Cove in Howe Sound and saw the decimation for herself. Other waters around Vancouver have also been impacted. \"In September, we started getting reports from divers and then we saw it ourselves.

It seems to us that it is probably a disease that just wiped them out... it hits the species in a big way.\" They are tracking the epidemic by taking photos of the sunflower stars and other starfish species that have been impacted. Healthy quarter-sized baby sunflower starfish have been spotted, Gibbs said, raising hopes of a recovery. There were so many sunflower stars that the wider ecosystem was being smothered by them. \"There are known diseases for sunflower stars and we think it just hit them in their overabundance and just took off... We suspect it's a known disease, not something weird or freakish. It's just taking off because it can,\" Gibbs said. \"The situation could actually be healthy, because there were way too many of them. Taking a necropsy of the dead starfish to find the disease has not been easy. \"We brought some samples up and the scientists weren't happy with that because they disintegrated... they want five healthy and five diseased. Vancouver Aquarium veterinarians have been in discussion with their counterparts around the world to find out more about the collapses of such starfish colonies but Gibbs said they wanted to gather and log their information before they collaborate with other scientists \"so we can talk the same talk.\" \"We're trying to figure out what's really going on.

Using the OIII filter at 158x and averted vision, the disc was apparent but it still appeared faint with even surface brightness. Greg, Walt, Peter, and Mary observed it through my scope at both powers, filtered. Greg had it in his 18\u2033 dob too and with averted vision, it appeared as a faint, round disc of fairly even surface brightness with sharp edges. This dark nebula is located just a little over a degree west of 50 Aquilae in a star rich area of the summer Milky Way. It extended east to west and was very opaque giving the impression that the area was mostly devoid of stars. This dark nebula is located near Barnard 142 about 1 1/2\u00b0 west of 50 Aquilae and is a distinct dark patch in a heavily populated area of the Milky Way. At 35x, the stars are of fairly similar magnitude with minor range in brightness, elongated in E-W position. I counted 12 stars with 2 brightest stars in W and a circlet of stars to E. Three star chains extend from the circlet to the W. M71 is nearby, approx. Located in a densely populated area of the Summer Milky Way in Cygnus, PK 64+5.1 can be a challenging object to find. When compared to nearby field stars at 92x in an 18\u2033 Newtonian, this almost stellar-like object appeared as a bright, mag. 10, deep orange-red star with a small, faint, orange-tinged diffuse glow. When the magnification was increased to 170x and 227x, a small disk of uniform brightness was clearly visible, however, its pale orange tinge was lost. The beautiful orange-red coloured central star in PK 64+5.1 is visible in small aperture telescopes, however, you will probably need an 8\u2033 or larger aperture to resolve its shell. A triangle of bright stars frames the fainter members of this sparse, loose cluster. The third star of the triangle is a couple of magnitudes fainter and appeared whitish-blue to my eye. 12 Lyrae is the bright, orange star which forms the SE corner of the triangle. 11 Lyrae is the blue star which sits in the NW corner. And the fainter, white star is located in the southern end of the cluster, forming the 3rd corner of the triangle. Looked great at 64x too; 158x was too much power. I counted a dozen stars at 35x; 25 stars at 64x. Large, bright, and compact in the finder and 10\u00d750 binoculars, this is a fine object in the telescope at low power. There are several nice groupings of stars with a chain of stars in the center. At 64x, very faint, hazy, oval disk of nearly uniform brightness. At 64x, I can see why this is called the E.T. cluster. At 64x, large, dim, fuzzy halo. At 64x, there were 2 prominent star groupings. At the left of the field was the first grouping consisting of 5 bright stars forming a semi-circle with a bright star lying off to the right and downward from the 4th right-most star in the circle. The second grouping of bright stars lay to the right of the FOV and reminded me of the shape of Lyra. There was an elongated \u201cV\u201d formation of bright stars to the SW. I noticed an elongated boomerang shape of bright stars southwest of the cluster. Having located the field with 64x, I replaced the 22mm Nagler with a 7.5mm Plossl and at 190x, I noted a 10th magnitude star engulfed in a bright patch of nebulosity which appeared triangular in shape to my eye and more discernable with averted vision. Very compact open cluster is located just to the south of M38. It is especially rich in stars and dense towards the western portion of the cluster. Very round shape with stars varying in magnitude from 9 to 12. This beautiful cluster\u2019s proximity to the more open and much closer M38 gives a perspective of the depth and dimension of Space. At first glance, the patch was dim, but as I studied it longer, the nebulosity took on more life and became brighter, larger, and presented an annular shape similar to a planetary nebula. At 114x, I moved Zeta out of the field and sure enough, there was the nebulosity although it looked nothing like its famed flame shape. It looked more like an elongation of the brilliant glow generated by Zeta Orionis, a mag 1.8 star that competes for the attention of the observer. At 64x, the cluster contains members of a wide range of brightness. In the center there is a box shaped asterism with double star in top left corner of the box. It has a curving arc of 2 stars moving up from the double star. There is a bright field star to the West. On the Eastern side there are 2 bright field stars and one is a lovely golden color. At 64x, stars seemed to form a square shape in the center of the cluster. Two stars curve outwards from a double star that sits at one corner of the square. Towards the west lies a bright field star and along the Eastern edge is another pair of field stars: one is a beautiful golden color. The members of this cluster vary in their range of brightness. This lovely galactic cluster lies to the southwest of M35 and appears quite small in comparison and many magnitudes fainter than its brilliant Messier neighbor. At 64x, tiny, sparkling, pinpoints of light are situated closely together in a beautiful formation that is somewhat reminiscent of a globular cluster. Perhaps it has been the deprivation of viewing globular clusters during these long autumn and winter months that renders NGC 2158 somewhere in between an open cluster and a globular cluster to my eye. Or perhaps it is the contrast of its attention stealing neighbor, M35, whose distribution is more open, that produces this reaction in me. Interestingly, upon first glance, the cluster appeared circular in shape, however, with more scrutiny at 158x, I came to see the stars positioned in more of a triangular formation which I imagined looking almost comet-like in appearance. Feelings of the depth of space surfaced as I admired this object and thought about how it contrasted with M35. And I imagine the stars would appear much more brilliant and colorful. Yes, I could even envision it competing gloriously with M35 for the attention of the observer and perhaps winning! This very loose open cluster consists of 20-30 stars with several bright stars forming the shape of a fir tree. Near the trunk of the tree is a small dipper shaped asterism. At the Northern end of the cluster, the bright star, 15 S Monocerotis, looked bluish-white in color, to my eye. There are multiple sets of double stars in the kite asterism area. At 64x, this open cluster was a bright, large grouping of approximately 30 stars that formed an asterism of an airplane. A long winding chain of 8th, 9th, and 10th magnitude stars extended from the Northern end of the cluster to the Southern tip forming the wing span. The body of the plane consisted of the bright, dense core of bright stars located in the center of the cluster. In close proximity to this cluster and complimenting it quite nicely, is a lovely tight, row of three 11th magnitude stars just to its North: H 148.1640, H148.1660, H148.2129. Nearby and to the West of the cluster, is a more spaciously separated row of three 7th magnitude stars \u2013 Hip32608, HIP32596, HIP 32572 \u2013 which contrasted very nicely with the 11th magnitude grouping. At 64x, very loose, cluster. There\u2019s an \u201cS\u201d asterism, a long line of 6 bright stars strung N-S along western edge, and dark lanes running through the cluster. An \u201cS\u201d asterism and several dark lanes caught my attention at 64x. I counted 6 bright stars snaking their way through this loose cluster, running north to south, along the western edge. Very nice. In the same field as the double star 63 Geminorum. A closer look at 158x revealed a central star surrounded by a bright halo that permeated outwards in a somewhat mottled, gray, hazy, glow. A bright star was located adjacent to the planetary in the 3:00 position. This planetary nebula is located in the same field as the double star 63 Geminorum. At 64x, it appeared as a blinking nebula. A closer look at 158x revealed a central star surrounded by a bright halo that was annular shaped and permeated outwards in a somewhat mottled, gray, hazy, glow. At 64x, There is a box asterism to NE and a horizontal line of 3 stars to the West. At first glance using 64x, the galaxy appeared quite large, rectangular shaped, fairly faint, with the brightest portions stretching E-W. The well defined eastern and western edges of the galaxy decreased in brightness beginning near the boundaries defined by the bright superimposed stars. I also noted a triangle of 3 stars directly above the western edge of the galaxy. 64x revealed a lineup of two 7th magnitude stars at a slight angle and to the West of this object. 158x revealed a hazy, glowing halo, however, this globular cluster is unresolvable. There were a few bright 5th, 6th, and 7th magnitude members towards the center of the cluster, sparkling more brilliantly than the stars of lesser magnitude that surrounded them. The placement of these stars emphasized the large range in magnitude in the cluster. This object lies in the northern part of the open cluster M46. It appeared as a ghostly circular wisp at 115x with an unfiltered view and it is easy to see how it could be missed if you weren\u2019t specifically looking for it under these skies. When I moved the Ultrablock between my eye and the eyepiece, the planetary nebula popped into view. The cluster, itself, appeared triangular in shape with a bright chain of stars running down the middle in a N-S direction which gave it a somewhat beveled, three dimensional appearance. There were several empty dark areas that were interweaved among the star chains which contributed to the cluster\u2019s textured, dimensional appearance. Large, bright, and oval positioned in a NE-SW orientation with direct vision, at 64x. A bright, elliptical, compact core with extended halo was revealed with direct vision at 158x and the nucleus appeared stellar in the bright core with averted vision, while the halo had a grainy texture. This elongated, oval, gray sliver extended in a SW-NE position. Very large, very bright, with diffuse halo and some mottling along the edges of the sliver. I was only able to see this galaxy with averted vision and even then, it appeared mostly stellar to my eye. At 64x, small, faint, oval with bright center. At 64x, bright, round core, with diffuse halo. M108 appeared dim, thin, and needle-shaped elongated E-W at 64x and at 284x with direct vision. M82 was extraordinarily bright, large, had a core with fairly well defined edges and a diffuse halo, stunning. At 284x, with direct vision, the galaxy appeared dim and elongated with considerable brightening toward the center. Averted vision extended the size of the halo a bit more. There was a bright star located to its E.\nAt 64x, it has a pretty bright, compact, circular core that extends a bit in an ENE-WSW orientation. NGC 3384 is in the same FOV to the NE. 158x with averted vision revealed a stellar nucleus, a condensed core with well defined edges, and a diffuse halo that grew gradually fainter as it eased outwards into the background. Direct vision revealed a large, bright, oval-shaped, granular looking core. There were 2 pretty, soft yellow, field stars to its west and southwest. Located in a field of 4 stars kind of forming a kind of square, not really rectangular, more like a square with uneven side. It is located between 2 of those stars along the western side of the square. Overall, it appears very diffuse, nebulous, and elliptical shaped. This galaxy was located in the neighborhood of NGC 3623 and NGC 3627. The core was faint, thin, and needle shaped oriented E-W. Best seen with averted vision. It was nestled to the east and below the second star of a vertical line of 3 stars. At 158x, with averted vision, it appeared to have fairly uniform surface brightness and was elongated in a N-S orientation. At 64x, oval, elongated E-W with stars superimposed on the halo. It was located close to NGC 3898 and at 158x, its oval, grainy surface stretched N-S.\nAt 64x, this looked like a star at first glance, but further observation at 158x, revealed a small, compact, bright core with a long thin halo that extended significantly beyond the core in N-S orientation. Very easy and large at 158x. Bright, large, and elongated in a NW-SE orientation at 64x with direct vision. There is a pretty double star which lies NE of the galaxy. The contrast in magnitude of the two stars makes the double striking as the primary is a few magnitudes brighter than its companion. Direct vision revealed a large, elongated, diffuse halo that extends considerably from the well defined core which appeared oval in shape. A well defined, bright, circular nucleus with sharp edges was well delineated inside the bright core. Both the core and halo stretched in N-S orientation. The size of the galaxy appeared to grow with time spent observing it using direct and averted vision. A field star located to the S and another to the N form a line with the galaxy in the middle. At 158x, pretty bright, large with stellar core and diffuse towards the edges. Very bright, large, diffuse and roundish in shape. 158x with direct vision revealed a large, elongated, well-defined, halo extending E-W. The halo is brilliant with the dust lane at the southern end. This galaxy was large, bright, and oval positioned in a WSW-ENE orientation with direct vision, at 125x. A bright, elliptical, compact core with sharp edges and extended halo was revealed with direct vision. Direct vision at 200x resolved individual stars at the core whereas the halo appeared mottled with few outlier chains. Bright core with very small, compact, faint halo at 64x. 158x showed more of the halo but still fairly compact. A member of the M101 Galaxy group. At 64x, small, diffuse, circular, faint tiny halo. Increasing the power to 158x did not reveal additional detail. A member of the M101 Galaxy group. Very small, faint, diffuse, and slightly elongated at 64x and 158x. Substitute for duplicate of M101. Small of medium, overall surface brightness. At 158x elongated N-S, with 2-3 bright knots in the halo region and bulging towards the center. Bright, round, small halo with core that appeared stellar at 64x. At 115x, small, faint, condensed, of fairly even surface brightness. This globular cluster was small with a distinct core. Although a bit brighter at the core, the halo was fuzzy. The stars are brightest towards the southern and western ends of the cluster. I counted 2 dozen stars at 35x. At 40x, this is a small, loose, irregular OC comprised of a few dozen stars elongated and spread out unevenly in SW-NE orientation. At 158x, this globular cluster was pretty faint, fuzzy, and granular in texture with some brightening towards the core. Somewhat compressed near the center around the 2 brightest stars. Not well detached from the surrounding field and NGC 6756 is a half degree to the North in the same field at low power. Four stars form a bright, large, square-ish shape towards the SE edge of cluster. There is an interesting looking arc of 4-5 bright stars towards the West and there\u2019s also a nice triplet lined up to NW. Using averted vision at the same power, the halo expands greatly. The surface brightness of the ring is uneven with a bright knot along its Southern edge. At 35x, 4 bright stars form a curving hook at the top of the \u201cCoathanger\u201d with 6 bright stars lined up E-W forming its base. North of the bottom of the hanger is a small bright curve of stars forming a semi-circle. A line of bright stars forms a NW-SE slash thru the middle of the FOV. At 64x, the western portion has several bright stars widely scattered about. The dark areas I noticed near 6823 turned out to be the dark clouds of emission nebula NGC 6820. I did not notice the bright areas of the emission nebula. At 35x w/Ultrablock, a blue central star with a small, round, bright, halo which blinked out with direct vision was noted. Using a 2x barlow with a 7.5mm Plossl, the halo appeared to become diffuse along the periphery of its outer edges while the inner area of the bright elliptical halo still appeared uniformly illuminated. At 64x, the brightest stars of the cluster\u2019s weak concentration consists of a cross or X asterism. A long, wide curve of bright stars forms a semi-circle to the SE of the X asterism. At 35x, the cross asterism looks fuzzy with 6 bright stars intersecting one another, the arc of stars to the SE is readily apparent. At 64x small, condensed, 5-10 faint stars. Without the Ultrablock, the size and brightness of the Dumbbell Nebula was significant at 129x but was lacking in definition and had an overall fuzzy, circular shape. Two small chains of brighter stars form a V.\nAt 64x, it appeared small, bright, and irregular shaped, of varying range in magnitude. It was difficult to determine where one cluster ended and the other began due to the way the stars are scattered about. Everyone agreed that this was the highlight of the evening for the Herschel objects we observed. It was large, rich, compressed, and detached from surrounding star field at 64x. The cluster was beautiful, appearing as a large sprinkling of stars of mostly similar magnitude contrasting against the black background of Space. Stars appeared somewhat clustered along wide star chains running E-W through the center of the cluster, demarcated by dark lanes. At 64x w/Ultrablock, this rich blue nebula has well defined edges, quite large, quite bright, and oblong in shape. At this higher power, I definitely noticed a dark protrusion a little more than midway through the western portion of the nebula with mottling throughout the fainter W edge. At 64x w/Ultrablock, I noted a bright star to the S of the nebula and another to its N nearly exactly opposite the star flanking its southern side. A third star is visible W of the nebula. At 158x and 284x, the 3 stars form a triangle and if you draw an imaginary line that connects these 3 stars, the nebula is sitting on one of lines in between 2 of them. At 64x, the stars in this cluster vary in their range of brightness. A bright star is located at bottom of the Y with another one closer to the V portion. At 64x, small, round, bright core with direct vision expands in size with averted vision. At 158x, the core and halo are better defined with some mottling; most likely stars that were just at the threshold of resolution with averted vision. At 64x, small, fuzzy with bright core; individual stars unresolved. At 64x, this cluster was large, bright, irregular shaped, moderately compressed and fairly well detached from the surrounding star field. I counted 40+ stars forming star chains, circlets, with a few dark areas interspersed through the cluster rendering it interesting to explore. There is a very pretty bright yellow star located to the NW. Large, bright, irregular shaped, poorly compressed, and not well detached from the surrounding star field at 64x. At 64x, bright, small, detached, and not condensed. There is a bright yellow star to E.\nBright, large, with diffuse halo extended E-W. Appears pretty faint, diffuse, and oval of fairly even surface brightness at 158x. At 158x, diffuse, faint, and elongated with fairly even surface brightness oriented N-S.\n64x revealed a bright, blue ball of even surface brightness and well-defined edges. Aquamarine with direct vision, shades of green dominated the blues. At 64x, very faint, hazy, oval disk of nearly uniform brightness. One of two companion galaxies of the Andromeda galaxy, M31. Bright, compact core with fuzzy, diffuse halo edges. One of two companion galaxies of the Andromeda galaxy, M31. At 64x, the bright, soft oval of M31 was flanked on either side by M110 and M32 in the same FOV. Lying 2 degrees to the south-southeast of Delta Cassiopeiae, this cluster is rich, bright, large and compressed with stars varying in magnitude and color. Two chains of stars extend to the east and southwest with several doubles scattered throughout. At 64x, I can see why this is referred to as the E.T. cluster. At 64x, detached, triangular shaped, few stars of varying range in brightness. At 64x, large, dim, fuzzy halo. A hazy mottling indicated where the arms were located, extending considerably outwards from the core. Expansive. At 64x, faint, diffuse, and circular shaped. From gamma And over to mu And over to 51 And over to M76, the Little Dumbbell in Perseus. At 129x I noticed a dark lane near the center with white-ish wisps to either side. I attached the UltraBlock filter which defined its structure more clearly. The two smaller hazy patches on either side of the rectangle looked like small satellites separated from the rectangle by dark area. At 64x, detached, loose, bright cluster of stars in a sparse star field. When I first glanced at this at 64x, it looked like a faint, hazy, grainy textured smudge. I put in the 9mm for a closer look but I preferred the view with the 22mm due to poor seeing conditions. The arms extending from the core gave the galaxy a slightly elongated structure, yet, it retained more of a circular than oval shape. It was small, fuzzy, whitish-gray, and triangular-shaped reminiscent of a comet! There was a curved chain of bright stars with the bottom of the curve oriented towards the North. There is a triangle of stars to the South. Initially, I was expecting an obvious delineation of well-defined and localized nebulosity, however, upon more scrutiny, it appeared as though the entire area was bathed in the soft nebulosity of IC 410. There is a lovely, brilliant yellow star positioned NE of the cluster whose color is quite striking. There\u2019s a rectangular formation of 7 stars to the North. Small triangle of stars to the West which is very pretty. Distinctively visible at 64x as a small, fuzzy, gray, circular object. The view deteriorated and became blurry using the 5mm Radian for 284x and was best viewed at 190x with a 7.5mm Sirius Pl\u00f6ssl which accentuated the halo and enabled resolution of the outermost stars and those in laying in its periphery. The center was quite bright and I was able to discern some mottling which looked like fine dark spikes interjected haphazardly into its edges which I attributed, at the time, to the dark lanes laying between chains of stars. Like M37, this cluster contained a lot more stars than M36 \u2013 about twice as many but it is much smaller than M37. At 64x, this cluster was very pretty but, to my eye, 129x really drew out an asterism of an old-fashioned keyhole formed by its brightest stars. Dark lanes were embedded in the portion of the asterism where one would place the key. The very center contained some bright stars which reminded me of being in a dark hallway, and seeing the light emanating from the keyhole. There is a bright chain of stars that points towards the North. With the unfiltered view at 64x, I saw a large, bright, whitish, oblong and irregularly shaped ghostly, wispy, glow interspersed with dark area protruding ever so minutely into its edges. It looks like a huge \u201cwing\u201d that eventually narrows into a point. In the central region of the nebula, the Trapezium, 4 stars were visible. There is also a very pretty lineup of three stars nearby to the West of Sigma Orionis. One side was brighter with more definition and stars while the opposite side eventually faded into the surrounding star field. There was a predominant oval formation of stars which I saw as the head of the octopus with chains of stars combined with dark lanes which flowed outward forming its legs. 129x drew out the dark lanes and the asterism morphed into a spider with spindly legs and large body. At 64x, the contrast between the quantity of stars just viewed in M36 with the volume of stars in this one was notable. Containing approximately 2-3 times the number of stars I saw in M36, their density was what made the most impression on me. At 129x, this cluster was even more pleasing to view with the color of the bright star near the center enhancing its appeal. Dark lanes are visible flowing through scores of beautiful, twinkling pinpoints of light. One of my favorites. Strewn along the top of the U are curving star chains. At 64x, this is a loose cluster with a backwards \u201cJ\u201d asterism; a horizontal line of 3 stars at the eastern edge of this cluster. At 158x, I was delighted to see the bright, fuzzy, wedge shaped object. This comet shaped object is composed of a star which mimics the nucleus of a comet while the nebula fans northward similar to a comet\u2019s tail. The very center of the star cluster was densely populated and contained a concentration of several bright stars. This combination of components produced a very pleasing pattern of alternating dark lanes and star chains which, at 64x, reminded me of a child\u2019s pinwheel. There is a very large, U-shaped, chain of bright stars at the NW edge of this open cluster. It reminded me of a champagne glass. The top of the glass faces the Northwest straight-on. Several bright stars run West to East from the top of the glass forming its stem \u2013 these stars lie in the center of the star cluster. A few stars float inside the top of this \u201cchampagne glass\u201d like fizzy bubbles of champagne! There were a few bright 5th, 6th, and 7th magnitude members towards the center of the cluster, sparkling more brilliantly than the stars of lesser magnitude that surrounded them. The placement of these stars emphasized the large range in magnitude in the cluster and was interesting to note, yet, not as pleasing to me as was the more consistent pattern I observed in M46. 64x revealed a lovely, densely populated open cluster consisting of many scores of stars. The members of the cluster appeared to be positioned in close proximity to one another with minor ranges in magnitude. The shape of the cluster is roughly that of a circle with few dark lanes and star chains deviating from the even uniformity of the group. Overall, the cluster looks like diamond dust exquisitely glittering in its ebony showcase. At 64x, the cluster is bright and angular shaped with dark wedges created by a lack of stars in the NW and SW portions of the cluster. It is elongated in a NW-SW direction with the clustering of stars coming to a point in the N, E, S, and W corners thus giving it a fleshed-out X shape like a butterfly! Forming the slightly distorted square of the base of the house were: SAO 98030, SAO 98032, SAO 98021, and Epsilon 41 Cancri. Forming the triangular roof of the house were SAO 98021 and Epsilon 41 Cancri which marked the top of the square and the base of the triangle. H1395.2711 and SAO 98010 formed the tip of the triangle. At 64x, I noted a chain of stars in the shape of a very wide letter U. A bright chain of stars ran from the Western end of the cluster and continues towards the E with an eventual curve towards the South. Reminiscent of M31, it appeared as a very large, very bright, fuzzy patch with a bright core and diffuse halo. It appears mostly circular in shape but with some elongation stretching a bit in a N-S direction giving it an oval shape. The granularity of the halo ebbed outwards in all directions with uneven and decreasing brightness from the bright central core. I located M81 which appeared as a slightly elongated, fuzzy oval. The nucleus appeared slightly brighter than the rest of the halo. I was unable to resolve the arms of the spiral. At 64x, bright, large, core with stellar nucleus. The nebula was quite large, bright, and circular without a filter at 64x. With the unfiltered view at 284x, I noticed the dark area of the eyes but I was not able to discern additional detail in that area. I attached the OIII and the eyes were still just barely detectable. In fact, I did not see the eyes as the authors of various books describe them with a luminous bar separating them or the object divided into 4 components. What I saw, was a hint of a difference in the *uniformity* of the luminosity of nebula in the area where the eyes are reported to be; just barely discernable with careful observation. Direct vision at 64x, revealed a bright, condensed core. At 284x, the nonstellar, core had a roundish shape, that was elongated N-S. At 64x with direct vision revealed a large, bright, granular core. A smaller, bright, NGC 3623 was in the same FOV. The arms were not resolvable yet the characteristics seen in the halo gave a sense of their presence. This galaxy was not visible at 64x, however at 158x, it was visible with averted vision. It appeared granular and diffuse, very faint, and was elongated in a NE-SW orientation. It was very faint, very small, and diffuse. There\u2019s a triangle of 3 bright stars to the East. Large, diffuse, elongated halo extending NW-SE. Bright, irregular, mottled nucleus. Very bright, large, diffuse, elongated N-S.\nA well defined, uniformly round nucleus with sharp edges at 158x. Very bright, large, diffuse, and circular in shape. Bright, elliptical in shape, extending N-S with compact core and diffuse halo. At high power, bright, circular, large, diffuse. At high power, bright, circular with large, diffuse, oval halo. At high power, bright, oval nucleus with diffuse, elongated N-S halo. At 64x, bright, roundish in shape, extending NE-SW. Condensed, bright core at 158x. At high power, large, rich, compressed, roundish, bright, resolved to core. At 158x, quite bright, round core with oval, diffuse halo extending NW-SE. At 158x, pretty bright, round, large of fairly even surface brightness. The core was quite bright, uniformly circular, and fairly large with an extremely bright nucleus. There are 2 fairly bright field stars: one to its S and the other to the W.\nVery bright, oval with bright nucleus and diffuse halo at 158x. Very condensed, small, bright, evenly circular core with few stars resolvable in the halo. Averted vision extended the size of the halo a bit. The core of NGC 5194 was round, pretty large, pretty bright and condensed with a distinctively brighter nucleus. It gradually brightened towards the middle, with a small, bright, round core and brighter nucleus. At 158x, this beautiful globular cluster is very bright and large with stars resolved all the way to the core. There were a few prominent chains of stars spiraling out Eastward and there was also a curve of outlier stars to the W. The core had a slight N-S elongation. I enjoyed the view best at 158x because it enabled me to view the radiating, curving outlier star chains, as well as, the brilliant individual stars of the nucleus. The outliers were lost at higher magnification although it enabled me to study the core in more detail. Very bright and large at 158x with stars resolved all the way to the compact core. A small core with elongated halo at 64x became more evident at 158x extending NW-SE with a prominent, bright, stellar nucleus in the core with elongated diffuse halo. A member of the M101 Galaxy group. At 64x, very large, elongated E-W with a small bright nucleus and 2 stars superimposed upon the oval halo. 158x revealed more knots and patches of textured brightening: two of the most prominent were located S of the nucleus with a third just N of it. At 158x, to the N, I noticed a small, stellar galaxy that was not plotted on SA2000. In looking at Starry Night Pro, it was probably NGC 5486. Members of the M101 Galaxy group. Bright, large, compact, densely populated core. The halo expands considerably outward with the stars fairly uniformly spaced as they radiate out, culminating in curving, spiral chains at 158x. This beautiful globular cluster is very bright, large, and loosely populated with stars resolved all the way to the core. I preferred the view at 158x. Large, bright, circular, with individual stars easily resolvable at the densely populated core at 64x. There were a few prominent chains of stars spiraling eastwards with a curve of outlier stars to the south. Best at 158x enabling views of the radiating, curving outlier star chains, as well as, the brilliant individual stars of the nucleus. Outliers were lost at higher magnification. Regardless of filter, the star was bathed in nebulosity which extended outwards significantly with averted vision. At 158x, large, cluster with a compact, bright core that appeared densely populated. Its halo is loosely populated and appeared slightly elongated in a N-S position. Bright, compact, core that appeared densely and evenly populated. At 64x, very bright, large, with stars resolved. Somewhat circular with bright area towards SE region. Bright, dense, compact core, with elongated halo in a N-S orientation at 158x. Bright, round, compact core, fuzzy, not resolved at 64x. At 64x, small, somewhat circular with bright core in sparse field. Individual stars not resolvable. Bright, large, rich, and loose cluster with the butterfly asterism apparent at low power. Located along the western edge of M7, very faint, very small and condensed with averted vision at 64x and 158x in my 10\u2033 dob. Observed in Greg\u2019s 18\u2033 with direct vision, it appears condensed and slightly irregular shaped and with averted vision it was elongated, grainy. Detached, bright, condensed, and irregular shaped with stars ranging in brightness. At 64x, loose, bright, roundish, detached cluster. At 64x, bright, small, detached cluster at 64x. Somewhat uniformly distributed. Bright, large, and irregularly shaped with stars superimposed upon the nebula. There is an open cluster, NGC 6530, embedded along its eastern edge. The halo blinked off with direct vision and with averted vision has an oval, bright, fairly uniform luminous halo. At 64x w/Ultrablock, it appeared a bright, rich, turquoise color with a halo that extends further outwards a bit w/averted vision. At 64x, Large and bright, shaped like a somewhat rounded letter \u201cZ\u201d. A few stars were superimposed upon the nebula. More definition was discernable with the UltraBlock filter. Small, circular, compact looking, fuzzy disk with a bright core and seated in a field of Milky Way stars. At 64x, round, bright, not resolved, medium compressed. At 64x, loose, bright cluster at 64x with many stars discernable. At 64x, large, round, bright with a chain of stars extending northward. Detached, at 64x, irregular, extending N-S with few bright stars. The Ring Nebula (planetary) appeared as a beautiful, annular, nebulous cloud that was slightly elongated E-W. It had well defined, sharp edges but the brightness of the nebulosity of the ring was not uniform. The Ultrablock further resolved the sharpness of the edges of the ring. Unevenly bright, annular and slightly elongated E-W with well defined, sharp edges at 64x. At 64x w/Ultrablock appeared, brilliant, stellar, and bluish. It was fun to revisit this beautiful star cluster which looked like a fairly uniform, small, fuzzy disk at 64x. At 284x w/OIII, appeared stellar and a brilliant, rich, turquoise blue with both direct and averted vision. A small, circular globular with the nucleus brighter than the edges. Round, loose, bright, large, resolved. The dark areas I noticed near 6823 turned out to be the dark clouds of this emission nebula. I did not notice the bright areas of the emission nebula. I noticed irregular groupings of stars without the brilliant central core one tends to see with a globular. Compressed, faint with bright round, core, stars unresolved. At low power with direct vision it appeared small, bright, and stellar with a rich blue color at both 35x and 64x with the Ultrablock in place. I\u2019m undecided whether I was seeing the central star or a small knot located at the center of the nebula that had a very high surface brightness\u2026to be revisited again when the moon is not interfering. At high power, bright, large, compact cluster with denser, bright core. At 64x the nebulae where elongated, wispy, strands much larger than my 1 degree FOV and easily visible with the UltraBlock filter in place as a delicate, lacey network of gray, ghostly filaments. Other than grayish-white, additional color was not apparent. Large, beautiful, bright, deep blue color with direct vision at 158 w/OIII. There are three stars lined up with the planetary it in a winding pattern, 1 on one side and 2 on the other. Appeared blue at 284x w/OIII with direct vision and bluish-gray at 158x w/OIII. Ghostly, glowing, spherical object with 2 stars located to the E.\nAt 64x, this dense globular was bright at the core and had a faint halo with few individual stars resolvable. At 64x, small, bright, compact cluster with dense core. At 64x, very large, rich, dense cluster of stars.", "hit_ratio": 12.025210084033613}, {"doc_text": "Disclosure: Thanks to Chicago Architecture Foundation for giving us 3D & 4D puzzles to give away and to review in exchange for spreading the word about the FREE Open House Chicago Festival.

It's now cheaper than most of the other non-steel options. It's also a lot softer than steel so (as you noted) it can be used in older guns. Hevi-Shot is a blend of tungsten, nickel, and iron. The advertised advantage of these shells is that the Hevi-Shot pellets are two sizes smaller than the steel pellets, which allows for matching of velocity between the two pellet types and also gives quite a bit more pellets per shell than standard steel. We have one sharptail hunt that takes place on a military base where non tox shot is required, or I would not bother with it, but I would rather shoot bismuth through my SxS shotguns than steel.

It didn't take nearly as long for her to find the top of the leaderboard. Seeking her second major championship of the season, Lewis made four birdies over the last nine holes of the first round Friday to take a one-shot lead into lunch. Less than an hour later, she was back on the course for the second round - a 36-hole day on tap, as the players try to make up ground after being rained out Thursday. The delays will turn the U.S. Open into a bigger endurance contest than it already is. But for starters, Lewis was in good form. \"It's in the back of your mind when you're walking up those hills at the end,\" Lewis said of the long day of golf. \"But everybody's got to do it, so you've just got to go out and do it, too.\" Trailing Lewis by a shot were and Ryann O'Toole and newly turned pro Lizette Salas, who also had afternoon tee times. \"It's kind of nerve wracking, but it comes with the territory,\" said Salas, a four-time All-American from Southern California. Also in the three-way tie for second was amateur Amy Anderson, who came to the Broadmoor early Friday to finish her first round, but won't start her second until Saturday morning, at the earliest. \"It's exciting; hasn't sunk in,\" said Anderson, a second-team All-American at North Dakota State. \"To me, it's felt like another tournament, just on the tour.\" All the tour's best are here, though Lewis, who won the Kraft Nabisco earlier this year, came in overshadowed - like everybody else - by Yani Tseng. She struggled keeping it straight - hitting only eight of 14 fairways - and finished the first round at 2-over 73. \"I kind of got used to the golf course,\" Tseng said. \"And then, I just kind of have to go back in the afternoon.\" Tseng was one shot behind defending champion Paula Creamer, who hit 14 greens in regulation but was often hitting her first putts from 20, 30 feet away. \"You can definitely shoot a good score,\" Creamer said after her 72. Webb was among those who came to the course early to finish her round. She played three holes, made a birdie on the last one, then went home to sit through a long wait. Cristie Kerr also had a quick day. Kerr shared the lead with Anderson overnight and faced a long bunker shot in front of the seventh green when she returned early Friday. She finished her round at even-par 71, but walked off the course with a good outlook. \"I'm not going to stress over it,\" she said. \"I'm pleased I have a lot of time to work on my game with my coach.

Various violations (traveling, 3-seconds, illegal screen, etc.) and bad passing get in the way of achieving our goal of getting a good shot. Usually it's not because of just poor shooting... it's turnovers, poor offensive execution, and poor shot selection. The 3-point shot is an important part of the game. But shooting a 3 every trip is not high percentage basketball. A 3-point shot taken with a defender flying out at the shooter is not a good shot (a shot fake and drive would be better here). So when is a 3-point shot a good shot? It's a good shot when your best shooter gets a wide-open look... or when a guard dribble-drives and then kicks the ball outside for a wide-open shot... or on a skip-pass where the shooter is wide-open. A 3-point shot in transition can be a good shot as well, unless we have a slim lead late in the game (as discussed above). How often I see younger post players get an offensive rebound, only to throw it back up, contested, or off-balance and not squared up to the hoop... it's like the player thinks, \"I got the rebound so I get to shoot it again.\" A much better play would be, if the put-back shot is not open, kick it outside to a perimeter player, who may be wide-open for a 3-point shot, or at least re-start the offense and, if you are leading, run some more time off the clock. Passing up a good, open shot is not desirable either, unless you are trying to run time off the clock. Sometimes a player will pass up a good shot, and then a bad pass or turnover occurs, and we get no shot at all. It's hard, but if everyone is aggressive in boxing-out their man away from the hoop, it can frustrate the opponent, and instead of working to get around your box-out, they may start pushing in the back or going over the top... which may get their \"bigs\" in foul trouble. We have a rule on sprinting back... whenever the ball is even or ahead of you going up the floor, you had better be in an all-out sprint to catch up, or we'll assume that you are tired and need a rest on the bench! But what if my best player is not getting back? Well, he may not really be your best player, or he's tired and needs a rest.

All three other men are in the bunker. A couple of good shots out the bunker from the European boys but it's advantage USA now. Rory misses his chance and it's down to Bradley now to win it. Garcia makes par, but it's Mickelson's three foot putt for the win. Looked great through the first nine but they trail by a point at the end of that session. Zach Johnson holes the putt, after an interesting system of Mahan straddling the ball first, to reduce the lead to one. McIlroy & Garcia got this one on thought, both held out Fowler in this years open they have the beating of him and Walker, Walker's game nowhere near the europeans either.

Goofy, being long and lanky, and no wimp, would take the most courageous approach to the hole, which is to unsheathe the driver with a flourish and slam the tee shot over the chunk of lake and toward the distant treetops, then give the old Goofy yodel as the ball ricochets among the Cypress trees. San Francisco has a goofy street (Lombard), a goofy prison (Alcatraz) and a goofy mode of transit (cable car), so it's fitting that the city's hip sports venue has a goofy finishing hole. Thursday, No. 18 was the toughest hole. Only three of the 71 players birdied it, including first-round leader Colin Montgomerie. And that was on an easy day. As Montgomerie said, \"We were lucky today, it was sort of downwind off the tee shot, but if it's the other way around, it can be very, very difficult.\" So if the wind comes up today, we could see some genuine anguish and floundering on 18. The goofy 18 is a 468-yard par-4, dogleg left, a test of nerve and judgment. The big boys drive straight, either straight over the first tree in a line of 10 trees, or just to the right of that big tree. The more conservative, and the shorter hitters, hit 3-wood to the right of the mean tree. But if the wind is at the player's back, as it was a bit in the afternoon, the 3-woods tend to carry into one of two bunkers. \"If your chili is running hot, you go with the driver,\" is the way one golf insider put it. The second shot -- wedge for the big boys, 5- to 7-iron for the others -- is uphill to a narrow, multi-level, multi-break, multi-heartbreak green. Adding to the difficulty of the second shot is the looming row of corporate luxury boxes, where it's always happy hour. The gay chatter, laughter and tinkling of ice can distract the sensitive golfer. Six players inducted themselves into the 18th hole 300-Yard Drive Club on Thursday -- Fred Couples (344), Stuart Appleby (331), John Daly (325), Niclas Fasth (312), Nick Dougherty (307) and K.J. The golfers say the 18th favors the long hitters, but none of the 300-yard belters birdied the hole. In Harding Park's extreme makeover, the 18th green was moved back, adding to the temptation to cut the corner with a driver and make the approach shot less daunting. The makeover architect, Chris Gray, admitted earlier this week, \"I think 18's a little bit of an awkward hole. It has the potential for controversy.\" The pros have been lavish in their praise of the new Harding, but the 71-man jury is still out on No. 18, a hole that is kind of out-of-character with the rest of the course. \"It's the only hole that's kind of goofy,\" Lehman said. \"The tee shot is a little awkward. So at the end of the day, it is a good finishing hole.\" None of the golfers fell in love with picturesque No. 18, which makes it all the more lovable to the spectator, assuming the spectator enjoys a hole that takes the world's best golfers out of their comfort zone. Billy Mayfair calls 18 \"Really severe.\" \"It's not my favorite hole,\" Jim Furyk said. Ian Poulter said, \"It's a tricky hole. You have to think about it, you have so many different options.\" \"It's the only quirky hole on the golf course,\" Luke Donald said. If you take out the corner tree, I think it would be fine.\" Better yet, let's give the 18th even more personality by giving a name to the big cypress that knocks down or deflects so many hearts. If you come to the 18th on Sunday one shot off the lead, you're most likely going to have to put away your dinky 3-wood, pull out the driver and challenge Big Nate. \"It's certainly different,\" Tiger Woods said of 18. \"You know, it's one of those holes if the tee was more to the right, I think it would be just a great hole.

The Hive is a school gate saga, which runs from the beginning of the Autumn term through to the following September. We\u2019re introduced to a bunch of mothers \u2013 there\u2019s Rachel, the nice, normal, if slightly scatty one who is just recovering from her husband doing a runner; Bea, the Queen Bee who everyone wants to hang out with; Heather who tries too hard; Jo, the permanently downtrodden stressball; Georgie, ascerbic and refusing to get involved. The beginning of the book sees this long standing group expanded by the arrival of Bubba, best described as nice but dim, Melissa, a boringly perfect Fairy Godmother type and \u2013 of course \u2013 Tom Orchard, handsome new headmaster. Most of the action takes place at drop off or pickup time, or at PTA related activities like the fundraising committee meeting, the Lunch Ladder or the Lakeside Ball. This leads to something of a whirlwind narrative; conversations are left unfinished, misunderstandings have room to flourish, we never find out quite what\u2019s going on behind the facade. This is of course an accurate reflection of life at the school gates \u2013 half formed friendships that never have a chance to blossom, snatched snippets of conversation, wondering if that person is really in a hurry or if you (or your kids) have done something randomly wrong. However, the very accuracy of the device leads to the book\u2019s biggest downfall \u2013 I did not get to know any of the characters enough to really care what happened in their lives. I mean I know I was supposed to be looking forward to Rachel and Tom getting together, and I know I was supposed to be glad that the new Queen Bee of the playground seemed to be a force for good rather than the shallow and heartless Bea, but really? I would have liked to know more about the children too \u2013 perhaps this is the mother in me speaking but for a novel based at the school gates, they seemed conspicuous by their absence \u2013 even in the life of Rachel, the main protagonist. Right now I can\u2019t actually remember the name of a single one of the kids belonging to this gaggle of mothers and while I get that the novel is about female friendship rather than motherhood, perhaps some more about the children and their interactions would have provided a bit more depth to the mothers themselves. There were some potentially serious themes in the book \u2013 a parent\u2019s suicide; classroom bullying (pretty much unnoticed by the mothers); Heather\u2019s growth in confidence being accompanied by a growth in meanness; but these were treated to much the same haphazard narrative as the more lighthearted events that make up the bulk of the book, and as such, did not add anything at all. I\u2019m all for comeuppance where it\u2019s needed but the flippant references to Zimmer frames and the need for a carer \u2013 along with the complete lack of interest from the supposedly good hearted main characters \u2013 left a sour taste in my mouth.

It is set at the edge of the Roman Empire, in the first century AD. An Imaginary Life is exceptionally well written, rich in poetry and evocative detail. It is a work reminiscent of the writings of a mountain hermit or nature mystic \u2013 but that\u2019s not why I selected it as the one Australian book that deserves more attention. There are no larrikins, no diggers, no Aussie battlers, and no tough yet world-wise women with hearts of gold. To me, though, it reflects a significant aspect of the Australian story \u2013 a sense of exile. An Imaginary Life tells the story of Ovid, the most famous and most irreverent poet of imperial Rome. Ovid\u2019s irreverence leads to his banishment to an isolated village on the shores of the Black Sea in current day Romania, a place occupying the literal edge of the Roman Empire. Exiled to the limit of the known world, Ovid is cut off from his own culture, even from his language. Slowly, the poet learns to depend on and respect those around him, those he once saw as unsophisticated barbarians because of their inability to speak Latin, their poverty, and their closeness to nature. Ovid sees nature as something somehow frightening, wild, unless it is cultivated, transformed and made productive by human hands. Ovid captures and tries to \u201ccivilise\u201d the boy \u2013 but this backfires on the poet in unexpected ways. By observing the wild boy, and then following him into the wilderness, Ovid realises Rome is not the whole world, and not even the centre of it. Ovid\u2019s predicament should be familiar to many Australians. Like the poet, many of us are acquainted with the feeling of being at the edge of things, on the wild borders of regions and empires to which we do not quite belong, or do not belong any more. For the first century or so after colonisation, Australia was on the periphery of the British Empire. Then, from the second world war to the 1990s, we understood ourselves to be on the outer limits of the USA\u2019s sphere of influence. Now we see ourselves as on the edge of the Asian region, but not really part of it. They also come to a moment of departure from somewhere else, the places where their ancestors, or they themselves, once belonged. Over the decades that followed, many of them were forcibly moved to missions in places as foreign to them as the Old World. There is in Indigenous communities a deep yearning and mourning for lost places; places locked behind gates and fences, places buried beneath cities and suburbs, roads and farms. It produces a sense of national belonging that is never quite secure. A common response to that insecurity is a kind of aloofness, a standing apart from the rest of the world. We like to single ourselves out, to brandish our physical and cultural distance from other places, our un-belonging as it were, as a mark of uniqueness, and of national identity that distinguishes us from others. This is also Ovid\u2019s initial response to his exile, to cling firmly to that which makes him different, to refuse to truly belong either to his community of exile or to Rome, which has cast him out. Another common response to this insecurity, that sense of un-belonging, is to turn to nature, to the environment. That may be why so much Australian writing has a strong sense of place, and why when we think of important Australian novels they are often ones that feature landscape as a character in its own right. It is their profound understanding and love of this place that has, over time, transformed the non-Indigenous view of it from something to be feared and tamed, to something to love and protect. Unfortunately, the landscape is still a contested space: the site of ongoing Indigenous dispossession, the site of mass species extinctions and environmental degradation. When we turn for a sense of belonging to the land, to the country, we are inevitably reminded of our un-belonging, or of our dispossession. Even so, nature, perhaps because it is undeniably a healing thing, continues to anchor us here, to ground us as \u201cAustralians\u201d. For many, contested though it is, the beauty of the land eases that sense of exile, of not quite belonging, whether their families have been here for just a few years or a few thousand years. For Ovid, it is the same. Slowly he comes to see the wild world as something to embrace, to cling to even, rather than something to fear. Ovid\u2019s great epiphany is that the untamed world is not a hostile place, but a new home where he can be free of the rigid structures of Imperial Rome. By venturing into an even further place, a greater exile, he becomes free. An Imaginary Life is, in part, about an individual journey from a state of being cut off and apart from the environment \u2013 of wishing to tame and exploit nature, of being totally entangled in language and culture \u2013 to a state of being in intimate contact with the untrained, wild things of the world. Ovid comes to this realisation by following the example of the wild boy, someone for whom the environment is not something outside of himself but an expression of his own nature. Those themes \u2013 of belonging and exile, of how to relate to the environment and to those who are different to us \u2013 are core to the debate about what it means to be Australian today. An Imaginary Life does not provide a workable template for how to navigate the complexity of belonging and un-belonging, nor should it. It does, however, show us it is possible to imagine ways to do things differently, ways to live differently with each other and with nature. Dallas J.

The many tones and colors that were alive in the vortex raised her vibration\u2014octave by octave\u2014until she felt as if she would burst. At the point which she could stand no more, the colors and tones permeated her form and transformed it into a vague human shape that was no more than a wisp of light. The swirling sensation then became internalized and she felt a million swirling vortexes fill her being. Each vortex spun at an increasing rate, creating a tapestry woven of the many components of her SELF. The spinning continued until the point of critical mass was reached and\u2014in a burst of light\u2014it stopped. She was in the void beyond the vortex. She wished to again visit Arcturus, but as the stars came closer, they began to encircle her. Faster and faster, they moved until they blurred into another vortex, a vortex made of stars. This vortex transformed into a tunnel with a stream of light flowing through it. Like a salmon following its instinct, she traveled against the flow of the liquid light. It drew her into it. She found a current in the very center of the stream that, if she surrendered to it, carried her up to the Source. She surrendered to this current and allowed it to fill her with its emanations. She, too, was a drop of liquid light seeking its Source. As the stream within a stream continued its upward journey, she could feel the waters of life simultaneously flowing downward into the lower dimensions to gather experience. Onward she traveled past lake after lake. She felt the consciousness of Rahotep, How-ta-shai, and Matia, her lives in which she was a Spiritual Initiate, guiding her with their combined experience. Almost in response to her question, the liquid light stopped. Rahotep, How-ta-shai, and Matia were within her, comforting her, assuring her. Suddenly, the current emptied her into a large lake. Abruptly, the lake disappeared, and Shature saw herself in a huge stadium filled with people. Feel the life force of each of them. Imagine that the bottom of the stadium represents the ancient times, and the top of the stadium represents the dawning of the new millennium, 2000 AD. You may notice that, even though you are aware of all of these people, they are only aware of themselves, and the life in which they are absorbed. As you have awakened, they, too, have begun to awake. \u201cNow, fill this stadium to the top with liquid light, and it again becomes a lake, but each reality stays within the confines of its own time-space coordinates. Allow yourself to surrender to the influence of the liquid rays of light. As you swim with the innumerable fish, imagine that they each represent a different fourth dimensional reality. The confines of time and space are not as rigid here, and each fish can move out of its initial location and communicate with the others around it. Love each of them for the experience they offer you. If you wanted to, you could hold each fish and it would tell you the tale of its existence, but that would keep you in these waters for years and years of your Earth time. \u201cAh yes, feel the familiarity of the fifth dimension. As you pull yourself into this lake, you can see that it is filled with thousands of crystals that hold the divine blueprint for the realities also existing on the third and fourth dimension. The crystals that are floating represent the realities in which you are a space traveler, and the grounded ones represent the realities in which you are bound to one planet. When you first ventured down from the Source, the glimmer of a group identity began to enter your consciousness and the Archetypes of the lower planes were born. Here, you live in group-consciousness, but you have a sense of yourself as an individual component of your archetypal energy. It is this archetypal energy that creates the foundation for each of your possible realities. \u201cFloat into the center of the lake, but keep a thread of your individuality so that you will not lose your self awareness. You are a drop of water, and you share your experience with every other drop. Feel the complete unity of All That Is. Now, gradually, allow the currents of the lake to carry you to the waterfall, and up to the seventh dimension of your Oversoul. Feel its liquid light as it caresses the vague memory of the form you once held. As you allow yourself to rise in vibration, hold on to our voice so that you can translate your experience into the mind of Shature. Feel the vibratory rate of the seventh dimension, and allow it to enter your heart so that you may feel the message of your Oversoul. Suddenly, the vision disappeared, and all that remained was the void. Since there was no time, no space, no thought, no feeling and no form, Shature could have been there for all eternity or simply the blink of an eye. All was Spirit\u2014Pure Cosmic Force\u2014until, gradually, a sound began to permeate the total silence of the void. It grew louder and louder and kindled a recognition of something yet unknown. The deep peace and total serenity of the void bade all formless potential to remain within it, but the sound circled the nothingness and embedded into it, creating a thin filament of light in the form of a circle. With the birth of this circle of light, other filaments of light slowly began to materialize from the total blackness of the void. These light filaments surrounded the small circle, causing a small flame to fan itself into existence in the center of the circle. Although the flame\u2019s consciousness was dim, its innocence drew more filaments of light to manifest from the void. In its first conscious act, the small flame transformed its circle into a heart and, in a sudden burst of light, the heart and flame were embedded into the matrix of a form\u2014a human form. At each point where the network met, there was a tiny vortex. These vortexes slowly began to decrease their spin as the flame within the core connected to each of them. With each connection, the flame of life grew in its awareness and recognized that it was taking a form. With this recognition, the flame became a fire, and the fire became aware that it was the heart of a body of light. Off in the distance the sound returned. It was a cry, the cry of an infant. Not one that had been born, but one that was crying to be born. The cry became a pull, and the pull became a sensation\u2014a sensation of movement and of gradual materialization. The tiny vortexes of light that outlined the form spun slower and slower and pulled the light body to another vortex. Whereas the first vortex had been one of expansion, this was a vortex of constriction. Tighter and tighter, denser and denser, the swirling tunnel forced the body of light to fill in the matrix with consciousness. When the restriction was almost intolerable, there was a swishing sound and the tunnel disappeared. The star was now a sun, which was encircled by nine planets and an asteroid belt. Yes, that planet had been known to the consciousness as Earth. The thought of Earth submerged the consciousness into an individuation known as Shature. Shature blinked as if suddenly awakened. She expected to see herself sitting again on the patio with Matia, but her vision was instead filled with the distant view of Earth. She could see the continents and the blue of the many oceans. She saw its moon as it encircled the orb. From this perspective, Shature realized that, just as a network of light surrounded her, a network of light also surrounded planet Earth. In fact, she could now see the entire solar system outlined by the light matrix. The resonance of a certain area upon the third planet felt so harmonious with her essence that it pulled her towards it. Yes, it was a cry. She remembered now. It was this sound that had drawn her back from the void.", "hit_ratio": 3.109090909090909}, {"doc_text": "Throughout the better part of the last decade, Sarah Lipstate\u2019s scope has steadily widened for her guitar-based project, Noveller. More often than not while listening to her music, it is fascinating and hard to wrap your head around the fact that the cinematic realm of the records is built entirely around the electric guitar \u2013 and by one single person. There are specific stretches \u2013 on efforts like Glacial Glow or Fantastic Planet \u2013 that are so stunningly realized and well-formed that it almost disturbs those of us who have listened to her for a long time. Disturbing in the way of \u201cWhy isn\u2019t this artist a household name by now?\u201d. Arriving this past week is her eighth full-length, the pulsating A Pink Sunset For No One. Her otherworldly constructions have never felt more like a director; not only behind the boards, but behind the camera. It should come as no surprise to hear that Lipstate is also a filmmaker in her own right, and listening to the cavernous hums and swirling guitars, here, only makes you hope that she\u2019ll release a companion movie at some point in the near future. Noveller\u2019s records have always been best experienced on a quality sound system in a confined space, or at the very least with a good pair of headphones latched onto the ears. A Pink Sunset For No One is the finest effort yet from one of the more under-appreciated instrumental acts in all of music. By continuing to push toward the more sprawling landscapes in her songs, Lipstate has made Noveller one of the more sonically captivating, immediate-imagery-painting projects out there.", "hit_ratio": 0.4090909090909091}, {"doc_text": "What fills in UNE MEELES (In the Hold of a Dream) is a distinct sense of wonder and technical mastery, lighting it from within like a faintly flickering candle in a window. Throughout the 12-track album, Nuut\u2019s violin is plucked like a ukulele, strummed, frantically bowed in additive passages of incoming-storm intensity and looped to create a hypnotic pastiche of lines that move with gathering rhythm. Tracks such as \u201cEeva & Maarja labajalg\u201d serve to not only display the traditional melodies of Nuut\u2019s native Estonia but to also place Nuut in a long line of accomplished musicians able to keep pace with intricate bowing and swirling melodies while simultaneously looping passages to create an overwhelming chorus of dense, pointillist sound. On \u201cJaa-ti-daa,\u201d Nuut throws her voice to create a multi-layered lullaby of circling melodies of monosyllabic lyrics over the delicate plucking of her violin. These melodies and traditional tunes feel lived in, as Nuut is a denizen, and not an interloper, of these tones and timbres. As an innovator, Nuut is able create wonderfully astute avant-pop creations that recall Final Fantasy, Kishi Bashi and Joanna Newsom. The delirious call-and-response of \u201cHobusem\u00e4ng\u201d is composed of multi-layered violin, looped vocals and rhythm, supplied by a distinct kind of mouthsound that recall the everything-is-music aesthetic of Czech weirdo-geniuses DVA. The song breaks into a cathartic peak, where each of these elements begin firing on all cylinders\u2014an impressively stitched-together cyclone of voice, violin and bodily rhythm that threatens to\u2014but never does\u2014fly apart in a splintering tornado of notes and body parts. \u201cSammud\u201d follows a similar pattern, constructing a shuffling-rhythm pattern through the field recording of shuffling feet. This usage of found sound recording elements, which seem novel today, has its roots in traditional folk music, which constructs multi-rhythmic narratives that are comprised of what was available at the time. \u201cKellatoas\u201d is a tiny world unto itself. The track is a strummed, plucked instrumental number focused around a singular musical passage while impossibly high-pitched drones swoop in and out. This recalls Amiina\u2019s gloriously pastoral ambient-folk and (listening while mourning the passing of Tony Conrad) resides moments under the sway of Conrad\u2019s otherworldly droning. As \u201cKellatoas\u201d segues into \u201ckiik tahab kindaid,\u201d Conrad\u2019s presence is channeled, even if unknowingly so, and drawn in through the looped dissonant passages: a rare moment of lament, a suitable dirge for the loss of a giant in the musical community.", "hit_ratio": 0.5272727272727272}, {"doc_text": "At the heart of Brighton\u2019s North Laine sits Resident Records, popular among those in the musical know.

In this spectacularly intimate setting, an audience of no more than fifty huddled around the makeshift stage for the stripped back performance. Welcomed by a whispery hello from lead singer Ellie Rowell, nervously perched upon the shop\u2019s counter, the band showcased their much-awaited second album, \u2018Visions of a Life\u2019. Launching into the melodic \u2018Sadboy\u2019, the powerful guitar riff set the foundations for Rowell\u2019s exceptional vocals; the haunting echo of her voice effortlessly floated along the moody, grungy lyrics. Having hypnotised the crowd, the band produced more jewels, including \u2018Beautifully Unconventional\u2019. The lyrics, \u2018light as a feather\u2019, were aptly fitting for her ethereal voice. The set truly blossomed during the performance of the classic \u2018Bros\u2019. The delicate acoustic arrangement evoked a folksy tone and was met with adoration. The highlight of the set had to be the closing song, \u2018Don\u2019t Delete the Kisses\u2019, a slow-burning track that stunned with a swirling, dreamy melody. After a moment of silent awe at the end of their performance, the crowd burst into adoring applause. Wolf Alice\u2019s unconventionally timid style underpinned the intimacy of the evening. They indisputably proved themselves exceptional live performers, arguably outdoing their incredible recorded material. Snaking around the familiar record stands after the otherworldly, intimately personal performance, we were reminded of the surreal nature of the experience.

She didn\u2019t hear the singer\u2019s silky but powerful voice that like melted chocolate flowed down to the throat, swarming across within. The artist didn\u2019t get on the stage, but she already saw him, although, in a strange way, from the stage not from the middle of the third row. She looked down from the middle of the stage, where the microphone stand awaited for its master.

The crowd came alive and sighed like one man, and then a loud shouting with joy could be heard. The tension of awaiting burst out from thousands of people. But she was not one of them from the crowd, because she didn\u2019t stand among them. She saw the excited faces in the light of the reflectors, saw them to laugh and cry and gaze at the stage \u2026 and at her. She was almost knocked over by the power of recognition. She stood on the stage! She, who was unable to perform to people, stood there on the stage, in front of thousands of people. She could not raise her feet, found it too difficult to walk. She felt that the hot sweat of cold fear ran down on her back and she lost control over her senses. She didn\u2019t hear the cheering of the audience or the music anymore. There was nothing but that blue light. It was she only saw. A voice flew to her from the distance. The Voice! It rang to her, sang for her. She saw the crowd waving as one toward the stage, but she was interested only in the source of that voice. He rose up under the stage like a vision. What about she dreamt before, came true. She saw the curly, brown locks; the shining, huge, brown eyes; the full lips that formed that beautiful voice perfectly. The next second he stood in front of her and waved to the crowd, greeted the people, and continued singing. And then he moved toward her. The recognition was overwhelming.

The song as a light breeze flew from between the singer\u2019s lips. She felt his breath touching her lips and she shivered with pleasure. Those fingers continued to caress her shoulder, arm and waist, and she felt like melted waxwork falling to the floor, because her legs were unable to hold her any longer.

Suddenly, a loud finale and silence. \u201cWould you like me to play a happy song or a sad song?\u201d he asked in English. \u201cA happy song, please,\u201d she responded in French, looking up and blushing.

She had never understood how the gentle touch of his hand could ignite her very soul with the most intensely powerful urges. Yet he always seemed to sense her deepest needs, as he lovingly coaxed her to a new level of pleasure. She knew all too well his style, knew that he would tease her by holding her at her peak, before releasing her, bringing her back down and quieting her soul. She could feel her very frame tremble in anticipation, as she awaited the sound of his fingers flexing in his gloves. Experience told her that he would pull her into an upright position, prior to mounting her. He would then hold her in that position, flexing the fingers of his right hand, tightening his grip and taking her back to the point where she would again roar with an all consuming passion, inflaming within her a fire that would burst forth from the very heart of her body.

Trembling, he stopped, hesitating before turning to take one last look at her, sighing as his eyes rested on her familiar form, taking in her sculptured lines, remembering how with the simple turn of his fingers she would come to life. He called out her name, beseeching her to acknowledge his love, yet knowing full well that she could not reply. Why his love had deserted her. Why She was alone and cold. She was destined to wait forever more, longing for his return. At the end of his last long ride.

Wang Hao showed Chi Ang one of the Chintamani key parts and pointed out that the one Seon Ah possessed should be in Moo Song\u2019s hands for the time being whereas the third one would be in Chae Yoon\u2019s son\u2019s possession. He kept believing in Chi Ang and reminded him of his promise. All Chi Ang wanted to know was the truth because he was desperate and he reminded his father the way he had raised him, like a child that would become a lion cub to survive if he was all alone in the jungle. Even though he wanted the Chintamani he ended up saving the boy, but he had left the child in the woods and had ran away to save his life. Losing his sight after being attacked was something he acknowledged as his punishment for abandoning the boy, but he was relieved to find out that the child was alive and well. Soon Deok found out that he was referring to Shi Woo and her father couldn\u2019t hide the truth from her because he was well aware that she loved him. Soon Deok was losing herself in tears as she couldn\u2019t believe that Shi Woo had to suffer because of her father who had abandoned him, but her father had to survive for her and Soon Deok put all the blame on herself. Shi Woo was at the bell tower armory and Seon Ah went to meet him. She was thankful and apologetic at the same time, but he was the one who was truly thankful because she went out of her room. Shi Woo was feeling uneasy in his sleep and Soon Deok entered his room and caressed him while telling him that she was there because he had called her. He was well aware it was a dream, but he was glad seeing her. She took him in her embrace and urged him to stop having nightmares, but she was also apologetic for everything that happened to him because of her. Shi Woo woke up in his empty room. A moment of unity had arrived now that the finest student of Moorim Institute had returned! Seon Ah found a letter from Soon Deok and she rushed to meet Shi Woo. It was her only way to tell them everything and Shi Woo and Seon Ah found out that they were siblings while Soon Deok was deeply apologetic as well. Seon Ah put her memories alongside Shi Woo\u2019s and everything was making more sense since both of them had survived from the same fire and the melody she was playing on the piano was the lullaby their mother was singing for them. He received a phone call from the chairman who wanted to talk to him about something that should be kept as a secret. She would return to China first and Chi Ang urged her to think of the times they\u2019ll spend together once he comes back. He was curious if she would be really happy moving in his father\u2019s house and all that mattered to her was the fact that Chi Ang would join her soon. After the phone call reached the end Chi Ang was losing his mind as he kept wondering if he should keep his promise to his father. Shi Woo went to Soon Deok\u2019s house to find out that nobody was there and he recalled the moment he told her that they would never break up, but he wondered why he was so sure about his feelings when he had uttered these words. Suddenly, everything was feeling so uncertain and he couldn\u2019t believe that the moment he had told her he loved was something that would eventually make her leave. Chae Yoon recalled his conversations with the chairman now and then and the face he had witnessed back then was the chairman\u2019s. The chairman was the one who had planted the seeds of mistrust towards Moo Song. He was intending to heal him with the Chintamani and all he wanted back then was for the chairman to give him the key part he had in his possession. Runa entered the game and when things were about to be over Chae Yoon appeared to defend him. The moment Runa tried to stab Chae Yoon, Moo Song shielded him with his body and got stabbed instead of his friend. Chae Yoon paid Runa back in her own coin and helped Moo Song who was apologetic for not protecting him the way he just did. Moo Song informed him that Shi Woo was his son who was alive and well and Moo Song was glad that he had taken after Chae Yoon. Seon Ah was recalling her conversations with Shi Woo which were Chintamani oriented. She noticed the seal\u2019s magical energy coming out of Moorim Institute\u2019s emblem on the floor and wondered if something bad had happened to her father. Wang Hao was informed that Moo Song was missing and Wang Hao was enraged. Chi Ang met his mother at the airport and he couldn\u2019t follow her right away because of his promise to his father, but he urged her to stop worrying. Chi Ang recalled the pendant Shi Woo was wearing around his neck and the fact that he had given it to Soon Deok. Beop Gong couldn\u2019t believe what was going on and one of the teacher\u2019s underlings tried to assassinate Moo Song but Chae Yoon pushed him away with his magical ability. Chi Ang was recalling Shi Woo\u2019s words that Soon Deok was the whole world for him and even though he wasn\u2019t certain if he would be able to make her happy he was happy being with her in the world they were living in. He became aware that Soon Deok had left and he asked Shi Woo if the pendant he had given her was the Chintamani key part. Even though it wasn\u2019t embraced in Korea, Moorim School managed to become the guilty pleasure of many drama addicts around the world. Moorim School\u2019s captivating vibes kept resonating throughout the whole duration of the episode with suspense, revelations, intense feels and a cliffhanger that was declaring the explosive aura of the forthcoming episode that would close the drama\u2019s curtains. On the contrary, it put together all the pieces of the puzzle when it comes to everyone\u2019s background stories. All that remains is to witness the final confrontation between Moorim Institute\u2019s virtuous beliefs and Moorim Association and Sang Hae Group\u2019s shady approaches with the Chintamani remaining the item of interest. The first ones want to protect it whereas the second ones want to use it to benefit themselves by any means necessary and in the most effortless way. Seon Ah coming out of her bedroom which had transformed itself into a cage that was keeping her soul enchained was a glimpse of her renewal and Shi Woo played his own part with his mind-awakening and insightful approach. Moo Song had been a paternal figure for her throughout the years and protected her in any way he could because he was deeply aware of the dangers that were waiting for her outside of Moorim Institute which was her whole world. It was the only place she had ever known after Moo Song saved her by putting his life on the line for his friend\u2019s daughter. Moorim Institute may had felt like a prison to her at times, but most and above all it was a veil of love and caring on Moo Song\u2019s behalf. While Moo Song was waiting for the right moment to reveal the whole truth Seon Ah had started losing herself in the poisonous words that were surrounding Moo Song\u2019s name and the only world she ever knew had been shattered in a blink of an eye. Her devastation was something logical since the tremendous amounts of pain she had received had clouded her mind and all the lies she had heard had shocked her to the extent of having a deeper impact than Moo Song\u2019s stare which was pleading for understanding. Seon Ah was able to restore the fragile balance deep within and she could see Moo Song once again as the paternal figure she always knew while still searching the courage that would lead her in front of her biological father; Chae Yoon. He denied the opinions of many people that were sincerely caring for his well-being and he chose to remain in the sphere of influence of that one person he shouldn\u2019t have kept following. It is true that a part of himself kept fighting back the person he had become. However, it felt as if he wasn\u2019t really looking for the one and only truth, but he was longing for his father\u2019s excuses to sound like the truth that would justify everything he had in mind. Wang Hao certainly manipulated him by fueling the fire with cards we were already aware of; his mother acquiring the position she deserved by Wang Hao\u2019s side and Chi Ang becoming as strong as his father. The way i see it, Chi Ang appeared as if he wanted to be used by his father in order to please his sickening obsession which was no other than having Soon Deok by his side by any means necessary and without taking into consideration her own heart and point of view. Chi Ang was neither happy nor self-sufficient and the fact that he kept nurturing his sickening and groundless obsession was making him lean towards the direction of obtaining more power because he thought he would have everything even though his life would be empty. Chi Ang chose to remain blind and he demolished any sane bridges that were connecting him to the reality he should start living in instead of the imaginary and senseless world he was constructing in the shadow of his father. Just like Seon Ah\u2019s mind had been clouded by the lies she had heard about Moo Song the same applied to Soon Deok the moment she found out that her father had saved but abandoned Shi Woo in order to remain alive for her sake. Soon Deok putting all the blame on herself was a moment in which noble idiocy made its appearance, but the truth she had heard wasn\u2019t less shocking to be honest. Everything going on lately and the fact that she had left Shi Woo and Moorim Institute behind had overburdened her and everything her father revealed was the icing on her doleful cake. !\u201d but that\u2019s another part of the story. Just a few scenes before Soon Deok\u2019s letter would arrive the emotional ambiance was already fortified. Seon Ah bringing Shi Woo at Moorim Institute was just the awakening of the fact that they were sharing something deeper than they\u2019d ever expect. Everything was gradually reaching completion, but something was missing and Soon Deok\u2019s absence the moment Shi Woo went to her house preserved the incompleteness of the moment as he kept reminiscing the promises he couldn\u2019t live up to at the present. Shi Woo protecting his friends and delivering all the necessary vibes to the new teacher, Choi Ho returning to Moorim Institute and everyone surrounding Seon Ah with love, Chae Yoon protecting Moo Song who eventually shielded him with his own body, Seon Ah declaring that she wouldn\u2019t let Beop Gong ruin Moorim Institute even more and Chae Yoon preventing Moo Song\u2019s assassination in front of everyone\u2019s eyes while Shi Woo was in search of Soon Deok were a miniature of the greater picture; strength through unity. The forces of Moorim Institute along with everything it kept teaching and preserved all along the way were finding their way back home to protect everything that was dear to them and secure the Chintamani from all the impure hands that were shivering in ecstasy even at the thought of getting closer to it. On the other side of the fence, Shi Woo kept preserving his love for Soon Deok while still thinking of Chi Ang as a friend, but without this meaning that he wouldn\u2019t go against him in case something were to happen to Soon Deok.

Months prior, she had determined to write a new song because she couldn't find a song that quite expressed her feelings about her home state. With little sleep, the next day she sang her new song from the balcony of the Bowers Mansion. Governor Morley Griswold and former Governor Roswell K. Colcord, who were both attending, liked the song so much that Bertha recalled of the event: former Governor Roswell \"propped his gold-headed ebony cane against the old square piano, removed his high topper from his leonine-head, and looking every inch the statesman, said to me, 'Honey, that's the prettiest Nevada song that I have ever heard.

His tail swished back and forth gently, and he lifted his head, the words of his song coming from his mouth, right from his heart, evoking the emotional reaction he got whenever he sang this song. The words became louder as he put his heart into his song, wondering where the other mares had gone. He hadn't smelled a mare in a while. His mother had been killed by a cougar, trying to protect him. Stardust wandered through the hills. She had heard once, that these were the singing hills, where creatures came to sing and find their soulmates. Still, each time she had come, they had seemed empty and silent. Lonely, in a way-but it really made no difference to her. She had been alone quite a while, wandering on her on own. Her home, where she had been born, had suffered a terrible drought. Many stayed, hoping the rain would return, along with the food, but she had gone, though she was still quite young. But since then, she had remained alone, wandering, seeking a place to call home. Walking on through the hills, she was surprised to hear the sound of voice-a male voice, singing out. She paused, her ears swiveling as she listened, before she began to move toward it, her own voice carrying through the hills as she began to sing, willing to take a chance, even if didn't end up working out. His ears swiveled around in every direction, trying to put a pinpoint location on wherever the heavenly sound was coming from. His mood immediately bounced from down to up, as a result of his bipolar nature. His heartsong wasn't the cheeriest of heartsongs, for sure. He snorted and trotted towards the noise, coming over a hill and looking down, his stance being held regally as if he were a king. He shook out his mane and stomped his hoof, his muscles rippling under his dun coat. Looking down on the momentary dip in the landscape, he spotted a mare. She was a beautiful mare: a shining bay color. Her coat gleamed very much like his; or perhaps that was simply his perception of her. He opened his maw once more, letting out a single line of his song, \"Where are you?\" He pranced down, his legs lifted high with each step, as he brought himself down towards the mare. It was an uneasy tension of possible rejection that caused his stride to lose some of its pep, and by the time he reached the mare he'd slowed himself to a dull and easy-swinging walk. His head was lowered considerably than from what it'd been atop the hill, but he raised it to look her in the eyes. She had beautiful eyes, as well. \"And who may you be to give me the honor of your presence?\" Stardust spotted the stallion approaching as he sang out one line of his song. He stood proudly at the crest of the hill, but as he approached her, moving down the hill, his gait became more uneasy, his head held lower. \"My name is Stardust,\" She told him, dipping her head politely, \"It is a pleasure to meet you, Hachiro.\" A wave of apprehension hit him and he shifted on one hoof nervously, listening to her with ears pricked forward and tail flagged. \"That's a lovely name,\" Hachiro said, smiling brightly. Of course, he was trying to flatter her, or impress her, or something, but his attempts weren't wholehearted. Ignoring the thoughts that he had in his mind, he tried to come up with a good conversation starter that wouldn't make him sound like a complete idiot, like 'why are you here?' It was quite obvious as to why, so he'd have to think up another question. \"Your coat looks quite well-kept,\" Hachiro commented, bringing his muzzle to her shoulder, but only for a moment. It was well-kept indeed: shiny, soft-looking, and it just gave off an air of rippling health. It was nice, he thought. He smiled at her, hoping his compliment made any sense at all, because the more he thought about it, the more stupid it sounded.", "hit_ratio": 1.4181818181818182}], "3": [{"doc_text": "She lived in a small town, worked at a small business and went to a small church.

The cancer took being a birth mother away from her. God laid her heavily on my heart, and as a result I consistently prayed, sent cards, and small gifts to help lighten her day. I knew in my heart that God had something special for this young woman to do, and if I did my part God would see that she lived to do what He called her to do. She faced many hard days.

There is no place in Reed Benton\u2019s heart for a woman. Can the faith of one woman with nothing left to lose create a miracle and heal two damaged souls? With her chest and throat burning, racked with chills that shook her thin frame, nine-year-old Katie Whittington huddled in her narrow bed. Only half-awake, at first she thought she had dreamed her mother\u2019s voice, so familiar, tinged with a hard-edged, soulless quality that held no love. But then she heard it again, clearly and for real, and the sound bur\u00adrowed into sleep-fogged corners of her mind, waking her completely. There were the other sounds, too. Throaty moans, whimpers, sharp, keening cries. A man\u2019s harsh, ragged breathing. The whining protest of coiled bedsprings from across the cramped, cluttered room. Katie rubbed her eyes and tried to hold back the hollow, jarring cough, but it erupted anyway. She covered her mouth with both hands and listened to the coupling noises, kept her back to the room, and hoped that Mama wouldn\u2019t yell at her again. She lay there pretending to sleep through the noise, painting pretty pictures in her head, dreaming of another life, another world for her and Mama\u2014the kind of world she had only glimpsed from afar, the kind she could barely imagine. In her lovely dream world, she and Mama wore pretty dresses, clean dresses, with starched lace and ruffles, and there were pretty hats to match. The weather was always warm and sunny, and whenever they walked down the street, no one stepped aside or turned away. Mama had tried to teach her to ignore the stares and whispers of the townsfolk, but the rudeness still cut Katie to her soul, and it always would. She hugged the torn wool blanket and coughed again, then wiped the palm of her hand on the dirty sheet that was little more than a rag. There would be a fancy yellow cover on her bed, too, just like one she had seen through the window of a big white house up on Poplar Street. The windows would glisten, and there would not be even one single crack in them. Katie rolled herself into a tight ball, hugging the thin blanket around her shoulders. She tried to picture her pretty dream house and all the lovely dresses again, and the plates piled high with hot food. When the images would not come, she looked up at the frosted windowpane above her head. Between the ripped curtain and halo of frost crystals, she could see a sliver of moon and one lone star shining in the night sky. She closed her eyes and wished upon that star. Then she opened her eyes, thankful that the moon was not full tonight. On moonless nights it was easier for her to disappear inside herself and shut out the sound of Mama and the men. But on nights when the moon hung full and heavy in the starless sky, she would silently turn away from the wall, stare through the milk-white light, and watch the shapes writhing on the bed. She would peer over the edge of her blanket and watch as Mama entertained the men who came scratching at the door. She must have fallen asleep, for the next thing she knew, Mama\u2019s hand was on her shoulder, shaking her awake. The single lamp on the crate beside Mama\u2019s bed cast a weak halo in the corner. Mama stripped off the blanket and tossed Katie the ugly green wool coat that some little girl across town had outgrown. They had found it in the bottom of the Christmas charity box that the \"self-righteous do-good\u00aders\u201d (as Mama liked to call them) had left sitting on the front stoop last year. It\u2019s cold out,\u201d Katie whined. Katie pulled herself up, climbed off the bed. Mama held Katie\u2019s coat as she shoved the girl\u2019s arms into sleeves that did not cover her wrists. Katie looked around for her faded red scarf, but Mama grabbed her arm before she could find it. Her mother pulled a tattered cotton hankie out of the bodice of her torn gown and handed it to her. Then she grabbed her by the wrist, dragged her across the room, and opened the door. Katie ducked her head to avoid the blustery wind that sailed in off the sea and tried to keep up as her mother tugged her down one cold, deserted street after another. Katie knew most of the lanes near the wharf by heart. They had trodden them since she could walk, she and Mama. They lived from hand to mouth on the money that the sailors and fishermen paid Mama when she took them to her bed. As they passed beneath a street lamp Katie glanced up at the familiar lines and angles of her mama\u2019s thin face. They were climbing now, up the hill, away from the wharf and the ramshackle houses that lined the narrow byways and shops close to the water. The houses up here were larger, prettier, and surrounded by trees, part of a forest that had once grown all the way down to the sea. Barely able to do more than shuffle behind her mother, Katie lifted her head and saw a tall bell tower and the steeple of a brick church. Her eyes tearing from cold, she struggled to read the sign on the front of the building. Mama was fairly dragging her now, walking faster, more determined. Mama\u2019s huge brown eyes were watering from the cold, too. A fat tear slipped down her bony cheek. The freezing night air, heavy and damp off the sea, burned Katie\u2019s lungs. Mama tugged on her arm when Katie kept staring at the statue. Katie sighed when they hurried past the church and the small graveyard beside it. Except for the sound of their hollow footsteps, the neighborhood around them was silent. Not a single lamp was lit inside any of the big houses lining the street. Suddenly Mama stopped to open a small iron gate in a low fence bordering the yard of another brick building, one almost as big as the church. The gate clanged shut behind them, ominously loud, with a sound that shattered the silence. The cobblestone walk that led up to the front of the brick building was patched here and there with dirty snow left from the last snowfall. Dead leaves trapped since fall peeked through. Katie lifted her head. Katie\u2019s legs gave out after the first three. She knelt on the stair, doubled over, coughing. There was another statue, too. Smaller, but it was the same sad lady who stared down at her with her empty, marble eyes. Katie slowly read the words again, faster this time, and frowned. They didn\u2019t know any orphan girls. Her mother pounded on the door again, then whirled around and knelt down beside her. She grabbed Katie by the shoulders, leaned so close their noses almost touched. \"Mama\u2014\u201d She let go of the kerchief and desperately grabbed hold of Mama\u2019s coat sleeves. \"You\u2019re scaring me,\u201d Katie wailed. Katie stared in horror at the big door and the gold-lettered sign. Having freed herself, Mama stood up; she stepped back as Katie tried to grab hold of the uneven hem of her coat. Mama dragged the cuff of her sleeve across her eyes and then wiped her nose. Katie jerked around at the chill whine of the front door\u2019s hinges. An elderly woman wearing eyeglasses and clothed entirely in black stuck her head out, blinking against the icy chill. \"Yes? Who\u2019s there?\u201d The woman had a gentle voice, but Katie was still frightened. Katie expected her mother to answer, but when she turned around, Mama was already down the cobblestone walk, hurrying through the little iron gate. \"Mama!\u201d Katie strangled on the sound, choked on a cough. She struggled to her knees, grabbed the column of the porch rail beside her, clawed her way to her feet. The iron gate clanged with a lonely, hollow, terrible finality. I\u2019ll be good.\u201d Her scream echoed through the empty streets. She was gasping between sobs, fighting the dizziness that clouded her vision. As she wilted toward the cold wooden porch floor where Mama\u2019s torn white hankie lay, Katie felt the old woman\u2019s arms close around her, heard the clack of wooden beads and a hushed prayer whispered beside her ear. KATE AWAKENED, heart pounding, blood racing. Nights bathed in moonlight held too many memories of the life she had lived with her mother. Kate shivered as she walked through a puddle of milk-white light to the only window in her sparsely furnished attic room. A utilitarian piece of un\u00adbleached muslin hung limp before the pane, as unadorned as everything else in this world of routine and orderliness where she had spent the better part of her life. Eleven years before, desperately in need of another teacher, the good Sisters of Saint Perpetua had asked her to stay on after graduation. She was given room and board and a small stipend in exchange for teaching history and elocution to girls of all ages. At eighteen, rather than face the streets of Applesby, she had accepted the offer without hesitation, knowing that someday she would have to go out into the world again. She promised herself that one day she would resurrect her old dreams, that she would have that pretty little home of her own and a family to hold dear. As time slipped away and spinsterhood crept upon her, she devoted eleven years to Saint Perpetua\u2019s orphan girls and all the joys and challenges of dealing with them. She had made a home here, one that was safe and warm and familiar. The nuns and the orphans had become her family. She could read and write in Latin. She was a teacher, a scholar. She would have to find another place to live\u2014no easy task in a hamlet where her mother had been the town whore. She had nowhere to go, nowhere to turn, and no one to turn to\u2014not even her mother. On Kate\u2019s eleventh birthday, Mother Superior had told her that the old shack near the wharf had burned down, that her mama had died, trapped inside. Now she looked out the window at the round face of the man in the moon. The moon man smiled back. Or perhaps he was laughing at her. She could not tell. AT THE END OF October, when the butcher made his final call to the nuns for an accounting, he found Kate standing outside the kitchen door with a hand-me-down satchel in hand. He was middle-aged and married, a portly man with fingers thick as the sausages he stuffed, and almost entirely bald. With no alternative in mind, Kate accepted. She rode the butcher\u2019s cart back to the shop, a sturdy whitewashed building near the center of town that was frequented all day long by housewives and maids. The room was adequate and clean, a refuge where Kate spent the better part of the morning scouring up the courage to go out and find employment. That afternoon, the butcher\u2019s wife knocked timidly on the door and told her that she would have to leave on the morrow.

If they gave her the position, the accusations of favoritism and nepotism would never end. The wind picked up and Koda scanned the audience again, searching for familiar faces. It was an absolutely gorgeous view. Behind her, the hills were lush with knee-high grasses and fields of purple flowers. In front of her was an inlet where the ocean water had carved into the reddish rock face, creating a deep swimming hole surrounded by craggy cliffs. Over the years, they&apos;d carved steps into the rock, making it an excellent place to address such a large group. Most of Koda&apos;s friends were on a lower cliff nearby, standing rather precariously on a small ledge halfway between the top of the cliff and the deep water below. They whistled and shouted luck to her. Koda shimmied her hips and blew kisses in response. The smaller kids that had been Koda&apos;s classmates all sat on a sturdier ledge with their feet dangling over the water. Elijah was among them, his ruddy cheeks and big eyes glowing with happiness under his mop of brown hair.

It was as if Dagoth-Ur himself was looming over the city, fanning the flames his heir had struck. A House guard, running toward the blaze, stopped at the sight of Tay, standing uncertainly, swaying, before the front door of Kalkorith's house, a bloodied blade in his hand. Tay ran for the forest, his cape whipping behind him by the force of the howling wind. The guard clambered after him, sword drawn. He had no need to investigate the house to see the murder. For hours, Tay raced through the wilderness, the Song pushing him onward. The sound of his pursuer faded away. At last, the trees thinned, and he saw nothing before him but air and water. A cliff, a hundred foot long plunge into the Inner Sea. The Song told him no. More than friends -- people who would worship him as the heir of Dagoth. As he slowly walked toward the edge of the cliff, the Song became more threatening, warning him not to seek to avoid his fate. Tay spat a curse upon his House and threw himself head first over the cliff. It was another glorious day on the island of Gorne, the first one in weeks that Baynarah could truly enjoy.

There are few cities on earth that need the healing, cleansing presence of greenery more than Tirana.

Designed by Canadian artist Jacky MacDonald, your coin features a timeless image of autumn in Canada, one that stirs a feeling of wistful nostalgia in its depiction of a beloved, longstanding tradition. Engraved directly into the silver, a classic steam locomotive is seen chugging along the winding, engraved track as a silver cloud of smoke rises up from its chimney. One could almost hear the train whistle echo amidst the tranquility of this forested area, which is ablaze with autumn colours that have been recreated with the use of red, orange and yellow hues of paint. Nature's breathtaking display surely delights the passengers on-board this leisurely fall foliage train ride, as they roll past the maples and birch trees that dominate this Canadian landscape.

Of course, we can also use the word skeletal literally: \"her legs are so thin they're skeletal,\" \"all we caught was this one skeletal fish.\" In that sense, skeletal is a synonym of c_d_v_rous, which describes things and people who seem deathly thin, pale, and worn-out, as well as _m_c__ted, which describes things and people who are too thin, as if they're weakening and wasting away. It might be way too thin, or more figuratively, too bare, like a basic list, outline, or framework that's missing all the important content. Adjective: \"a skeletal report,\" \"it's so skeletal.\" You can skeleton something or skeletonize something, meaning you outline it in a bare, meager way--or reduce it to a bare outline. When you call something skeletal, you're comparing it to a bony, skinny skeleton, emphasizing how lacking it is in meat, muscle, content, or substance. For that reason, \"skeletal\" has a negative tone. It's a fun alternative to less picturesque words like \"lean,\" \"scrawny,\" and \"tenuous.\" You might use \"skeletal\" literally and talk about a fashion model's skeletal figure, or the skeletal steel frame of a building under construction.

They enjoyed the night air, cool and fresh after the heat of the day, and clean with almost no traffic. Joe pulled his truck into the parking lot of the train station. A hot summer sun had been beating on the asphalt and the humans for hours, and it was almost at its zenith. Parents were crying and shouting, and tempers were flaring as parents tried to move their children\u2019s belongings to the sidewalk and then up to the rooms. Up on the second floor, Emily found her room halfway down the hall. The window faced west and looked over the Cemetery, a park-like foreground to Lewis Mountain. Putting her messenger bag on the desk, she unloaded her panniers into the closet and made her bed. She was standing at the mirror next to the desk wondering if she wanted to rent a micro-fridge when the door flew open with a crash. Emily eased off the bed as he stood up and turned around. \u201cHi. Behind her came a shy-looking girl with wide, blue eyes, and blond hair in a ponytail. When her gaze settled on Emily, she smiled weakly, and put down the two totes she was carrying. Cindy was about Emily\u2019s height, but thinner. Her expression shifted from awe to pleasure, and her smile widened and went up to her eyes. She had dyed blond hair cut shoulder length, and tanned, leathery skin. She had a massive pile of clothing and other belongings on the bed by the time her father pushed his back through the door with a micro-fridge and another suitcase on a dolly. \u201cI was just wondering whether to rent one of those,\u201d Emily offered, as he swung it into place.

Alden had four empty suitcases on the dolly, and the women had one in each hand. They walked across the street to a four-door, king-cab pickup truck and heaved their loads into the bed. Emily looked around the room. The micro-fridge was covered with decals from Virginia Tech and organizations that she did not recognize. The pile on the bed included wear for every occasion, including two long evening gowns, suits, a fan, a large, professional hair dryer, jeans and tee-shirts in every colour possible. She had just finished drinking and putting glass on the left side of the sink, when Cindy pushed through the door. Yes, Mom. Bye, I love you, too.\u201d She tapped the phone and rolled her eyes as she threw the phone on the desk. Together, they had Cindy\u2019s closet crammed full in just a few minutes. It took a while to sort out the things she would use to put in the drawers. What was left, she put in the suitcase. \u201cFirst run home,\u201d she said, patting the suitcase and leaning it on the wall near her desk. The desk was full of items, but the bed was clear. The medicine cabinet and Cindy\u2019s half of the sink were full. They laughed, grabbed their phones and wallets, and locked the door behind them. The noise level reminded Emily of the hallways in high school between classes, except for the deeper voices of the fathers. Alden was courted by the defense contractors for his skills, but he liked working with his hands. He became a custom builder and handyman, and his business was booming when Cindy came along. She was surprised that the Matthews family had never vacationed abroad, but considering that a builder\u2019s busiest and most profitable season is the summer, it made sense that Sandra and Cindy would take small trips rather than extended holidays. As they settled into seats in the auditorium, she noticed a student in the row in front of them with an \u201cI registered\u201d sticker on her shirt. \u2013 \u201d Applause cut off whatever she was saying.

Two wine glasses and a bottle of red in her hands, she approached J.J. slowly.

Emily sighed and placed her glass on the low table in front of her. \"Yeah.\" Emily glanced at her after a long few moments of silence, but J.J. just looked at her with a steady gaze. Leaning forward, Emily put her elbows on her knees with her eyes on the floor. \"That you resigned in order to protect the team, especially Hotch, from Strauss. Taking a deep breath, she exhaled deliberately. \"Yeah,\" she said, standing and making her way to her kitchen. J.J. watched her walk away, following her every move as Emily opened one cabinet to grab a crystal tumbler and then another to pull out a bottle of vodka. Emily froze, the bottle in her hand forgotten as J.J. approached. J.J. asked. J.J. stepped around the island separating her from the other agent and took the bottle from Emily, placing it on the counter and putting on its lid. \"You scared me,\" she said to the granite countertop. Emily hesitated, her hands wrestling each other to prevent them from reaching out to the younger woman. I told Hotch that Garcia had tried to talk me out of resigning and that if she couldn't no one could, but the truth is I knew you could. I had to protect you, all of you, and I didn't want you involved with what was happening.\" Again, silence settled over them until J.J. nodded and met Emily's eyes. \"Good,\" J.J. said and then leaned forward to press her lips to Emily's. The older woman was momentarily surprised but didn't hesitate as she returned the kiss with vigor, drawing J.J. closer and deepening it with an intensity that should have alarmed her. When they parted, Emily couldn't stop a goofy grin from forming. J.J. asked. \"I've noticed,\" J.J. said.

'I can't lose her,' she admitted, her voice trembling. Rory, to her credit, was coping remarkably well. Instead, she sat down next to Rory. 'You look ill,' Rory persisted. There was a lengthy silence. After a couple of minutes Diana moved to sit next to Maia and was satisfied by the fact that her daughter collapsed into her arms. 'You'll be the first,' she promised, watching them vanish around a corner. Then she fell into a stiff chair and buried her head in her hands. This was too much like a nightmare. She thought there was something she should've done differently, shouted to Lorelai to stay back perhaps. After a couple of minutes of worrying what was going on in the room she decided to go in and check. Diana didn't want to intrude, but she didn't particularly care to leave either, so she stood there with her arms crossed watching the tableau from afar. Then she let out her breath and checked her watch. It was after eight already. Going back into the room where Lorelai lay, she dropped down heavily into the plastic chair beside the bed and reached for the returnee's hand. 'Rory needs you, Lorelai,' Diana said softly. 'You're my daughter, Lorelai,' Emily answered simply. Stepping back, she watched mother and daughter embrace and saw the tears running down Lorelai's face- half of them were from fear, she knew. 'Oh, kid, nothing could,' she answered, pulling her daughter into another crushing hug. To Diana's enormous surprise, however, Maia- who had been watching the scene from a little way down the corridor- took the seat closest to Emily and put her hand over Mrs Gilmore's tightly clasped ones. Emily started, obviously shocked by the gesture, but then she accepted it with good grace and bit down on her lip to, Diana guessed, control her raging emotions. That was easier said than done, she realised, as two more faces ploughed into the waiting room. He understood, she recognised, and when he motioned with a nod for her to follow him she did so without hesitation.

'I have to go someplace, Rory,' she said steadfastly, fixing her gaze on the automatic doors a few yards ahead. 'I need your help, Shawn,' she admitted. Once Shawn arrived she could walk in there with a resolution. She was just praying for that moment to come. Maia, she knew, would be safer at the hospital than anywhere else. Lorelai was lying unconscious, possibly dying, and it was down to her. No matter how she tried to talk herself round the truth of the matter was that Lorelai wouldn't be fighting for her life if Diana hadn't interfered in it. Shivering involuntarily she glanced around at the family photographs, the warm environment Lorelai had so seamlessly recreated for herself and her daughter. Suddenly she felt extremely sick. Looking around for her cell phone that she'd dropped somewhere after her conversation with Shawn she grasped at it and dialled with shaking hands. 'Hey, Tom,' she breathed, relieved to hear a familiar voice. she sighed, recognising his tone. It was the one that edged into conversation whenever there was a new problem with the 4400. Tom asked. She knew why he was asking- he was concerned for an impressionable young girl- but the guilt she felt for Maia having dealt with a premonition of her mother's death stung at her sharply. 'Yep,' she lied, her stomach somersaulting. Her announcement alerted the rest of the group who all gazed at her; some expectantly, some quite angrily. 'Yes,' Shawn said, appearing under pressure. 'Can you?' he repeated. The returnee nodded and pressed through the nearest doors with Luke ahead of him. Diana waited for some kind of sign that Lorelai's back had been irreparable, but none was forthcoming. After first looking confused Lorelai then frowned then seemed panicked and looked around. Diana met her eye though the plastic of the door and felt a lump in her throat. Before she could do anything, though, Rory and Richard had steamrollered past her. She didn't want to explain the emotions currently raging inside of her; particularly not to a child. That meant, she realised with a jealous lurch of her stomach that Christopher could be in there as well. Maia cuddled into her side, drawing her mind away from Rory's father. After Maia nodded Diana stood and followed Emily around two corners into a quiet secluded corridor of the hospital. It was the way which led to the morgue, she recognised, and wrapped her arms around herself as the implication of that thought sank in. 'I'm not disputing that,' answered Diana, wondering where this was going. she added, though she almost felt where this was going. 'I just mean that you've obviously informed her of your special relationship with her mother,' Emily answered innocently. 'Thanks, Luke,' she replied, hesitating then pushing through those all-too-familiar double doors again. This was becoming something of a ritual, she realised. Looking through the plastic that separated the returnee from the rest of the hospital, Diana saw her engulfed in a hug with Rory and, alongside and looking altogether ecstatic, was Christopher. 'I've said all I have to say to you,' Diana said icily. Falling silent, Diana contemplated what Lorelai thought on the matter. Emily was right: Rory wasn't to find out yet. And, perhaps, Diana would grudgingly concede she was correct on another count- from watching this family scene she would guess that Rory did desire a proper family unit. Luke was talking to Sookie at the other end of the corridor. Diana didn't have the strength for a fight: Emily Gilmore had just knocked the stuffing out of her. Even with Maia clutched at her side she felt she was missing a chunk of herself. Still, she kept herself moving mechanically and barely recognised when they reached Stars Hollow. The town was still in recovery by the looks of it. There was a huge tarpaulin over the site of the accident and investigation crews made it clear to Diana that the assassination theory was being investigated meticulously. Diana almost smiled but couldn't muster the energy. It was only when she found Tom sat on the doorstep of the Gilmore house that she remembered his promise. Upstairs she almost found herself floundering.

The apartment was perfect, down to the last detail. From the cosy over-stuffed furniture in the living room, to the colours he'd picked for the sheets on her bed. She'd been worried, when he'd opened the door, that it would be like the castle somehow. But it wasn't. Never roses, tulips, or sunflowers. The waxy blooms hadn't even begun to brown when she came to get a cup of coffee and discovered the tiger lilies had supplanted them. When she turned 15, Pete and Clark had helped her re-paint the pink wall a shade of green that had seemed like a good idea when she'd been staring at a little 2 inch paint chip, but had been much more... green when they'd gotten the first two coats up. She'd ended up covering up most of that wall with her desk and bookshelves. It had been a shock, when the movers had hauled all her stuff over to the new house on Sycamore, to see the unbroken expanse of emerald. Lana had made noises about re-decorating the first few weeks, but half the boxes she'd packed stayed packed, and were in storage in the empty apartment above the Talon. Chloe and her dad had hauled them all up the week-end before the trial. It seemed a million years ago. The bedroom Lex had created for her was all warm tones, but not a drop of pink to be found. Tan, ochre, and pumpkin with cheerful butter-yellow trim. Like most things Lex was involved it, the planning always seemed over the top, but somehow he always pulled it together in the execution. The bathroom had a tub deep enough to drown in, and there were never any cobwebs in the corners of the high ceilings. She expected to see candles floating across the rooms if she turned a corner quick enough to catch them. The closet was full of clothes in her size. Everything the hip young 17 year old in Metropolis could ever want, from $200 Diesel jeans to hand-painted tops from Spain and Japan. She'd recognised his taste in a few items\u2014and she'd wondered if he'd handed the task of outfitting her to a minion, or if he'd actually called up the designers himself. She supposed in another month or two, it might be a different story. The fridge was always stocked. It had to be, since she couldn't actually run out to the store. If there was something she craved, she either wrote it on the message pad magnetted to the giant stainless-steel doors, or picked up a phone and called the guard, who called someone else, who brought it to her. From Thai to a hotdog from the stand across the street from the baseball stadium, she'd yet to make a request that wasn't met within 45 minutes. It was better than Domino's. She had no idea what the monthly cable bill must cost, but she guessed it was equivalent to a year's tuition at Kansas State. She'd spent three days watching nothing but the BBC, and soon switched to alternating between Bollywood musicals and Argentinean soaps. There was a case of DVDs with everything from His Girl Friday to Girl With A Pearl Earring. He even had screeners of all the stuff which opened in theatres delivered week by week, but somehow, she just couldn't imagine sitting on her couch, watching Troy without Pete or Lana right there beside her, either to ridicule the history or drool over Eric Bana in leather. Clark hadn't been in the picture for a long time. She still missed her friend, but it wasn't the same way she missed Pete and Lana. When she'd first heard about the Ross's marital problems, she'd sympathised, having lived through divorce herself. What hurt most\u2014what had always hurt the most\u2014was that the universe really did seem to revolve around Lana. It was jealousy, plain and simple. Even Lex went out of his way to make sure no waves ever splashed up against her shores, disturbing the mirror-surface of her tranquil little world. The Talon was failing financially? She could have been free of her sometimes-rival, sometimes-sister once and for all, but she'd begged her father to let Lana move in with them. In her perfect apartment where she wasn't allowed to cross the street to get a paper and a cup of coffee, Chloe was utterly alone. It was a lovely gilded cage, but a cage all the same. The first time Lex had come to find the place trashed and Chloe curled up on the corner of the couch, still in her flannel pyjama pants and tank top, her face puffy and red from crying, he'd just knelt at her side and touched her shoulder. He'd held her awkwardly as she'd cried herself out, not even bothering to whisper hollow words of comfort, because that's not who he was and that's not who she wanted him to be. All she wanted was her father. The next morning, the flowers in the kitchen hadn't been changed.

The driver circled her, looking annoyed but refraining from the rude gesture she anticipated. Apparently drivers were a bit more polite in a small town like Laurel Ridge, Pennsylvania, than they were in the city. Ridiculous, to let just the sight of the place send her into a tailspin. She was tougher than that, wasn't she? But while she could face down a recalcitrant politician or an irate citizen in search of a story, she couldn't maintain that level of detachment where her younger brother's death was concerned. Some of the stones were worn and tilted, their lettering eroded, while others were new enough to make it obvious the cemetery was still in use. The whole place had a well-tended air, the grass mown, with beds of gold-and-burgundy chrysanthemums blossoming here and there. She could find it, she supposed, since the name had shown clearly in the newspaper photo she'd scanned online. Movement reflected in the rearview mirror startled her, and her stomach tightened as she realized a police car had pulled up behind her. Great. All she needed was to draw official attention to herself before she'd even begun the task that brought her here. Taking a firm grip on her nerves, Kate planted a smile on her face and hit the button to roll down her window. She was about to speak when a closer look at the man's uniform gave her another shock. He didn't affect the dark sunglasses so many cops did, and his brown eyes studied her, missing nothing, she felt sure. \u201cAre you having car trouble, ma'am?\u201d His voice was a bass rumble. The last thing she wanted was to rouse the suspicions of the local cop before she'd been in town for five minutes. Protective, that was what it was. \u201cI appreciate the recommendation.\u201d She turned the ignition key, her fingers brushing the silver dragon charm Jason had given her, and put her finger on the window button. She put the car in gear, glanced behind her and pulled out. It was simple enough to watch Whiting in her rearview mirror. She'd never been arrested, so a query to the police there wouldn't help him, even if he went that far. She might be excused for losing her grip just a bit, but it was unfortunate. She'd made herself an object of his interest before she'd had a chance to do a single thing. She could have claimed to be writing a newspaper story about Jason's death, but that didn't sound credible even to herself, not after over a year had passed. Kate made the turn onto Main Street and drove down it at a sedate speed, reading signs as she went. There, ahead of her on the left, was the caf\u00c3\u00a9 Whiting had mentioned, and on her right the bed-and-breakfast. She slowed, peering toward the rear of the white clapboard building, and caught a glimpse of a small building nearly hidden by the trees. She hadn't been here when Jason had needed her, but she was now. He wasn't following the woman exactly, but she had stirred his curiosity. Kate Beaumont had seemed vaguely familiar to him, but he couldn't quite place her. Thick, honey-blond hair was pulled casually back on the nape of her neck, allowing wavy tendrils to escape and curl around her ears. Her lightly tanned skin seemed touched by the gold in her hair, and even her eyes were a golden brown. Ms. Beaumont wasn't headed toward the caf\u00c3\u00a9. Instead, she was walking up the sidewalk of Blackburn House. Now what, exactly, was she up to? Curiosity had him turning in at the driveway that ran along the side of the building. At the rear of Blackburn House stood the old carriage house, converted into the workshop of Whiting and Whiting Cabinetry. Not that he was the Whiting or the son involved in the business. Dad might have had hopes in that direction at one time, but when Mac had come back from a stint in the military, he'd known the carpentry trade wasn't for him. Still, Dad seemed content with one son in partnership, and the business suited Mac's brother, Nick, perfectly. Parking, Mac eyed the back door into Blackburn House. She really would have cause to cry harassment if he did that, wouldn't she? Instead, he headed into the cabinetry shop, prepared for the usual din of saws and hammers. He raised a thermos in Mac's direction, and Mac grinned and nodded. No doubt Nick was lunching with his fianc\u00c3\u00a9e, Allison, assuming she'd been able to get away from the quilt shop. His father, instead of eating the lunch Mom had packed for him, was bending over a rocking chair, carefully hand-sanding a spindle. The normal work of the shop\u00e2\u0080\u0094custom-designed kitchen cabinets\u00e2\u0080\u0094sat all around him, but he was focused on the rocker instead. Folks said Nick looked more like their father, but all three of them had the same lean, straight-featured faces. \u201cBetter not let Mom or Allison hear you complaining.\u201d Mac leaned against a handy workbench. Since he was safely removed now from the farmhouse that his brother, Nick, and Nick's young son shared with Mom and Dad, he could take a more detached view of Nick and Allison's wedding preparations. Mac bent obediently over the chair, hands caressing the smooth curves of the fine maple.

Well... if you go deep enough its dark, quite, and feels like the water is going to crush you from all of the pressure. answered Arnaaluk, whom then decides to tell her a little more about the surface where she usually reside \"But on the surface, the waters are emerald green full of fish, seals and whales.

Remington could seriously do without seeing Darby every time Kit was around. He was certainly fascinating, but he gave her the creeps! She knew that she still had one on under her romper, but he didn't know that.

Emma bit her lip; something was bothering him. The smile and the wink were genuine, but there was something underneath. \"My sister, Lila, and I came here about three years ago. We sang together . . . I did the music, and wrote the lyrics, and we thought we had had something.\" We were playing in this little club and he just . . . .\" Emma felt herself blush and wiped at her eyes.

He told me I didn't need her, that he had all these . . . contacts or something from people who were interested in me, if I would dump Lila. Then, I swear I couldn't tell you the first time it happened, but he got me on drugs. I mean, I never wanted anything to do with drugs. At all.

I told her I'd try to bring her in later, but . . . .\" She shrugged. We were at this party, a Christmas party, when I told her. I kept writing and singing and he kept saying, oh, sorry, it didn't work out but I have another guy I want to talk to. \"No,\" said Luke, \"he used you. \"I was just someone to, I don't know . . . keep his bed warm, amuse himself. He told me how it just wasn't working, he had to focus on whatever-her-name-was, and could I have my stuff out by the next morning. I kind of . . . fell apart after that.\" There was more to the story: how she'd been on the streets for a couple of weeks, then found a girl she'd met through Sam, and who knew his MO. She helped Emma get back on her feet, get into rehab, and then later, she'd met Millie and gotten her job and apartment. After a few blocks, Emma said, \"You know what one of the worst things is?\" \"Every sort of milestone, every bad thing, happened around Christmas.\" \"I haven't been able to write a note, or a word, or sing since that. Sometimes it . . . I feel so empty.\" He guided the horses around the corner, stalling for time. It was his turn to talk, even though he was still processing what Emma had told him. Emma patted his arm and he wondered if she'd read his mind. \"It was so good of you to listen to all of that and . . . well, you don't have to say anything you don't want to.\" He looked down at her. \"That was the deal, remember?\" \"I can't say mine is quite as dramatic, but . . . .\" He shrugged. \"I call every so often, but I never get anywhere. \"It's ridiculous, really, since my younger brother is all about the farm.

We didn't care for her husband and it was mutual, but we tried to get along. I called once, left a message . . . they never called back.\" But she never . . . never called me, or anything. We had one cousin, but we weren't close, so I don't think she would have gone there, either. I saw a few people we both knew, but they hadn't heard from her.\" They weren't twins, but they'd often felt like they were. They finished sentences for each other, picked on up on moods without saying anything . . . they had been best friends. \"I hate to say it,\" Luke told her, \"but we have to get back. \"You know, I'm always surprised that the horses aren't frightened,\" Emma said, talking over her relief at Luke's answer. \"The cars go speeding by, honking, but the horses just keep going along. \"They do.\" Luke chuckled. \"Or I like to think they do, but really, it's the blinders. \"Not me, though, right? Luke dropped the reins over his knee and put his other arm around her to pull her close. Emma nodded, then twisted her fingers in her lap. \"I . . . I've never even dated anyone since . . . I wasn't sure anyone would want to once I told them.\" Luke laughed as well and wrapped his arms around her. \"I'd much rather stay here with you than ride around in the cold.\" \"I think we should find more ways to be together,\" he said, and Emma hoped her answer was apparent in her response to his kiss. \"That feels great, but I'm not sure you want Sol catching us doing that.\"", "hit_ratio": 2.009009009009009}, {"doc_text": "\u201cWonder how long it's going to take for word to spread that we're married now,\u201d Inuyasha murmured quietly as they walked, none of the villagers within earshot. \u201cCan you take him?\u201d she asked after Kagome was already holding the baby, who'd immediately quieted down again in the miko's arms, and then without waiting for an answer Sango turned and scurried back over to the pot of rice she was currently cooking. Kagome chuckled at the quip as she had a seat beside Sango, little Ichirou still in her arms, but Miroku didn't have time to react to his wife's comment, his daughters immediately demanding his attention. \u201cYes, I can see that,\u201d Miroku answered, humoring the elder twin. With Kagome and Inuyasha officially invited to stay for lunch, not that either of them actually needed an invitation, Sango insisted, exclaiming that the two of them were of course welcome at any time, the foursome held off on starting the conversation everyone was eager to have as they sensed little Shippou's approach, knowing the kitsune would feel left out if they didn't wait for him. \u201cFor the rest of my life,\u201d the miko added, not bothering to cover her mouth as she smiled, the expression more genuinely happy rather than amused. In reality, Miroku's words were meant to tease not only Shippou, but Inuyasha, as well. He didn't believe for a second that their feisty little future-born miko was suddenly going to become a quiet, obedient wife. Sango was anything but quiet and obedient, and he wouldn't have her any other way. Inuyasha instinctively flinched, genuinely startled, which caused Kagome, Shippou, and Sango to snicker quietly in amusement, while Miroku laughed a bit more heartily. Inuyasha turned and glared at his wife, but there was no real fire in his eyes. He definitely wasn't pissed. Embarrassed, maybe, but not pissed. \u201cI thought it was,\u201d she answered nonchalantly, which earned a chuckle from the hanyou himself that time. The miko laughed despite the heat she could feel rushing to her cheeks, Inuyasha's own deep blush at Shippou's words making her feel more amused than embarrassed, herself. Three years ago she would have admonished the boy for saying such things, but despite his appearance Kagome knew Shippou was actually a lot older than he looked, and even though his appearance wasn't really an illusion because he was still just a child, by youkai standards, there was simply no way a young kitsune boy was going to remain ignorant to the ways of mature adults. Especially when she considered the fact that some of the lessons he was learning in his version of school probably included how to transform into a beautiful woman to seduce unsuspecting men. It was the oldest kitsune trick in the book, and one Miroku had been all too happy to help the other foxes perfect during their impromptu stay at the Kitsune Inn that one time. Inuyasha, shaking his head at his wife's antics, started going over the list of things he wanted to get at the market the following day with Miroku, asking the houshi to give him from his stash the amount of money he figured he'd better bring with them. He asked for more money than he honestly thought he needed, having a fairly good grasp of what most things cost from his numerous trips to the market with Miroku, but this would be his first time going to there with Kagome, who was now his wife, and if she just happened to see something, anything, that she ended up wanting, he wanted to be able to buy it for her. He told her as much when she raised an eyebrow at the amount of money Miroku counted out into the pouch he then handed over. She figured a nice quiver might be a bit expensive, but it couldn't be that expensive. \u201cIt's not like I'm going to want some fancy necklace or hair comb,\u201d she insisted, flattered but wanting to reassure her new husband that material things weren't really that important to her. Instead of wasting any of the monk's ink for such a trivial thing she asked her new husband to please grab her a charred stick from the firepit with those fireproof hands of his, and he immediately complied, finding her a good one that was about the same size as the pencils he remembered from the future. Some sewing supplies, like needles, a thimble, thread and thread wax, a pair of scissors, plus a good length of some plain, inexpensive fabric, so that she could have something to practice with before cutting into the nicer fabric she'd been given. \u201cKeh, done,\u201d he said with a nod, not even hesitating a moment because he knew he had plenty of money to cover the cost of such things. Inuyasha and Miroku both chuckled, while Kagome cocked her head to the side and gave her husband a curious glance. Inuyasha gave her a funny look at that, and then chuckled again, shaking his head some in amusement. Inuyasha opened his mouth to say more, but it was in that moment that his ears suddenly turned to face the door, before flattening against his head, a mildly irritated expression appearing on his face. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Kagome asked, but before he could answer there was a light rapping on the doorframe. The neighbors gushed their greetings as Miroku bid them entry, bowing to both he and Sango, and then, remaining in the beaten earth entryway, they bowed humbly in the bemused hanyou and miko's direction. \u201cOh, Inuyasha-sama, Kagome-sama, we heard the fabulous news and wanted to congratulate you both on your union right away!\u201d the woman stated, her husband adding, \u201cAnd rest assured, my lord, the men will be gathered quickly to begin work on your house. Kagome could hear Inuyasha's quiet sigh, only because she was sitting so close to him, and then almost as if he'd slipped a mask in place, he rose regally to his feet before nodding his head back at both of them. Kagome waited a few seconds before speaking, until she was certain they were out of earshot. Heading back to Kaede's house, finally, the future-born miko shared the good news about her and Inuyasha's marriage with Kaede and Rin, and they both congratulated the pair as well, even though they'd both already known that morning what the purpose of their visit to the headman's house had been. Kagome immediately agreed, of course, stating how it stood to reason that eventually, when the time came, a shrine being built in that location to honor the presence of her and Inuyasha made perfect sense. Said hanyou didn't really want to think about a future time when all that might be left of his wife was a shrine built by the villagers in her honor, though, and so he quickly changed the subject, asking Kaede if there was anything she wanted them to pick up for her in the morning. Kaede nodded her understanding, as she went through her various containers of herbs, preparing to make a medicine she really did need for somebody in the village that time. It wasn't another ruse to give Inuyasha and Kagome an excuse to leave together again, and in fact the herbs would not be offensive to his nose, she assured him, as she caught him eyeing her preparing the ingredients. Glancing Inuyasha's way nervously after she spoke, worried he might've had other plans, he gave his new wife a reassuring smile that silently told her to go ahead and let Kaede show her how to make that medicine. Kagome grinned his way in reply, her eyes thankful, and she then proceeded to listen to everything Kaede had to tell her. Besides, he wasn't 100% sure he trusted himself to be that alone with her again, at least until their house was built. The fact that she was his wife now, and he could rightfully\u2026 Well, his right or not she still deserved better than to be taken out in the forest like an animal. He was an animal, or half, at least, and that was bad enough. He was still worried about how she would react to learning about his other inhuman features, although he was trying to take her confident reassurances to heart that his youkai half didn't bother her in the slightest, even when it came to matters of the bedroom. He hoped that that was true, since there was nothing he could do about that part if it wasn't, but he could at least promise her a roof and a bed for those activities, instead of throwing his inhumanity in her face by using the wild forest as their bedroom. It was the least he could do. Just because he was half dog didn't mean he had to rut her in the dirt like the dog he was. In this, he would focus on his human half, and resist his youkai instincts. He could survive off the high of simply knowing that she was his wife until their house was finally built, and hopefully by that time he'd have finally gotten over the rest of his insecurities as well. It was probably something the two of them needed to discuss openly, he realized, but not right away. Of course, if Kagome had any say in the matter, she'd get him to realize that she did not require a roof, or a bed. In that moment the future-born miko was doing her best to actually pay attention to Kaede's lesson, though, unaware of the true severity of her new husband's inner turmoil. She wanted to learn herbs, after all, and she was doing her best to commit her sensei's words to memory. But it had not escaped her comprehension that Inuyasha and she were husband and wife, now, and all that that entailed. In her mind, that was what the privacy of the forest was for. In the meantime, though, when it came to their actual sleeping arrangements at night, Kagome had been telling the truth before when she'd told Inuyasha that she was certain Kaede would not mind it if they simply lied next to one another, and if he was too embarrassed to have witnesses then she was also sure they could use the changing screen to partition off a private corner of the room for themselves, to preserve modesty. He'd chickened out the night before, so she suspected Kaede and Rin baring witness was a good part of it. He no longer had the added excuse of them not technically being married yet. If he thought he was still going to sleep upright against that blasted wall of his, he had another think coming! Still, Kagome knew she should rightfully ask Kaede her permission, first, since it was the elderly miko's home and she did not want to risk possibly offending her new sensei. She didn't honestly think it would offend Kaede, or she wouldn't even bring it up and leave Inuyasha to his wall, figuring better safe than sorry, but she knew Kaede well enough by that point to know what she could and couldn't ask the elderly miko without pushing boundaries. She also knew what she could and couldn't ask in front of Inuyasha without it embarrassing her poor hanyou to high heavens, and asking Kaede with him sitting right there if it was all right with her if they snuggled would be too much for the inu-hanyou, she was sure. The eleven-year-old, once again dressed in her usual yukata, immediately complied to Kaede's wishes, putting down her new sewing project to run her errand for her. She was happy to help, knowing the elderly miko couldn't move as fast as her and that this was only a quick delivery of the medicine the people were already expecting and already knew how to use. Promising she'd be right back as she grabbed the jar of medicine, she dashed out the door. Kaede put a pot of water on to boil, then, while asking Kagome if she wouldn't mind washing the rice for her. Smiling sincerely, grateful to help in any way she could, Kagome immediately began washing the rice, and then turned to glance Inuyasha's way while in the middle of her task, putting her plan into motion. \u201cHmm?\u201d he asked from his place against the wall, watching her work with a lazy, stupid grin. She grinned as well at the sight, realizing he was probably even happier about their marriage than she was, which she hadn't previously thought would be possible, but considering the life she'd had growing up versus the life he'd had, she couldn't blame him. Had she never been able to return to the past, she could have theoretically gotten over him and fallen in love with another man, she knew. Theoretically, at least, even though it would have never actually happened. It wasn't fair, and it wasn't right, but she understood it was the truth. She'd spent her days as a little girl daydreaming about having a fancy wedding, about what kind of man she was going to marry, but Inuyasha, he'd spent his days as a little boy being told he was a worthless abomination by everyone but his mother, with nobody even willing to be his friend, let alone a potential girlfriend, and by the time he'd reached potential girlfriend age he'd been too busy trying to stay alive in the wild forests to worry about something as unrealistic, in his mind, as one day having a love to call his own. While she'd given up her once-dream of a fanciful wedding ceremony, she didn't honestly care, having married the love of her life, and she couldn't be happier, but knowing that he had also married the love of his life, and that he was still trying to wrap his head around the fact that the woman he loved even loved him in return, Kagome found herself feeling even more happy for her husband than she was for herself. She had literally made his dreams come true by returning to him, and he'd already told her to her face that he'd do his best to give her whatever she wanted, whatever she asked of him. It was a little cruel to take advantage of that to send him out of the house in that moment, but ultimately it was for his own good, anyway, and besides, she wasn't lying. \u201cI won't be long,\u201d was all he said, and grabbing Tetsusaiga, he was out the door. Kagome didn't hesitate to launch into her request, promising Kaede that she had no intention of scandalizing her and Rin with 'marital activities' from behind the screen, but that she wanted only to be able to sleep lying beside her husband, for Inuyasha to feel comfortable enough to hold her in his arms as he'd already told her he longed to do. Kaede, as predicted, waved off Kagome's concern, assuring the younger miko that of course it was all right for her to share a private corner with her husband for such purposes, stating that Miroku and Sango had also done the same during the time it'd taken for their own house to be constructed. She'd known of course that Miroku and Sango had stayed with her until their house was finished, but the little detail of whether or not they'd all still slept together in the one big open room like during the quest days, or if Miroku and Sango had used the screen for some semblance of privacy, had never come up. Kagome alsoknew that those two had also engaged in 'marital activities' prior to the completion of their house, having learned that bit of information during her lunch with them the day of the feast, when Inuyasha had been out hunting down that deer. Miroku had quite shamelessly boasted how he hadn't been able to wait even one more day on marrying Sango after the battle was won, hence why they'd gone to the headman right away to record it, just like she and Inuyasha had done that morning, and since they'd obviously not yet had a house to call their own, either, Miroku had said that he and Sango had taken off for the market village straight afterwards, even though it wasn't Market Day, because that village, much more a town than their own humble village, possessed a proper inn. Thinking about it in that moment, though, as she put the cleaned rice on to cook, Kagome knew it was much too late to head to the market village now, and besides, tomorrow was Market Day and so they'd be there, anyway. Maybe, if she played her cards right, Miroku would be making the walk back home alone. She didn't have his ears, but she wasn't deaf, and there had been plenty of times throughout the shard hunt where she'd heard the various whispers, people wondering why 'those people' \u2013 meaning her, Sango and Miroku \u2013 were traveling with 'that creature' \u2013 meaning Inuyasha. Even though she'd been a stubborn thing back then, and had insisted on wearing her school uniform for the principle of the thing, because she wasn't going to let other people tell her what she could or couldn't wear, she wasn't stupid, and she'd known how a skirt that short was viewed by most people in the century she now called home. Realizing in that moment that getting a room at the inn could either be an awesome idea, or a horrible one, she wouldn't try to be slick about it. She'd ask Inuyasha outright if he wanted to. It was the best way to know his thoughts on the matter, after all. Might be a little more brazen than he was expecting, but she was almost nineteen years old, and she was his wife; she had a right to be brazen, and more importantly than that, saying things outright would prevent any future misunderstandings. They'd had enough of those to last them a lifetime. It was that mind-set that gave her the confidence to stick to her guns later that night, after dinner was through. Inuyasha had successfully caught a rabbit, of course, returning with it already skinned and gutted, and while Kaede'd tended to the vegetables Kagome had chopped up the rabbit meat, cooking it in a separate pan. Kaede had politely declined having any of the rabbit meat for herself, but when Rin had asked if she could have some Inuyasha had given Kagome a curt nod at her questioning glance. Dinner was delicious, and now, with Kaede and Rin already ready for bed and settling into their places by the firepit, Inuyasha sitting up against the wall as per usual, Kagome knew it was time to act. First, she ducked behind the changing screen while leaving the screen in its customary location, stripping out of her yukata and into her pajamas. She changed that routine up, however, by laying her sleeping bag down much closer to the storage chest than she'd done before, having previously brought her bag further out into the center of the room, closer to the fire, like the others. She turned her head to look right at him, and smirked, the opportunity way too good to pass up. \u201cWell then you're just going to have to keep me warm,\u201d she answered, making sure to keep her words a very quiet whisper so that he wouldn't feel the added embarrassment from fearing that either Kaede or Rin had overheard her. She then proceeded to grab the screen from its corner and bring it over to where she was, setting it up between herself and the fire, which also meant, of course, that she was now completely cut off from the two people lying down on the other side of the fire. From his place against the side wall Inuyasha could still partly see behind the screen, seeing part of her movement as she settled herself down into her sleeping bag, but it was obvious to him that she hadn't been intending to block even half of his view of her. He felt his cheeks flaming at the thought, but that didn't stop him from slowly, very slowly, getting up and heading over in her direction. Setting Tetsusaiga down by her bow, he knelt down next to her as she propped herself up on an elbow to look at him in the darkness, their private little corner by the storage chest in shadow thanks to the screen blocking the direct light from the fire. He didn't reply verbally, but something in his eyes changed at her words, his gaze smoldering, almost burning right through her. It was a look not of sexual desire, but of desire as a whole, in its truest form. He whispered quietly then for her to turn around, and she immediately did so, and he didn't hesitate to tuck himself fully against her, pulling her in close as he spooned her from behind, burying his nose in her hair and inhaling deeply. It occurred to him vaguely in the back of his mind that his sense of smell was pretty much out of commission all of a sudden, since all he could focus on was her. His ears, too, seemed to home in exclusively on the sound of her breathing, the rhythm of her heartbeat. It was potentially dangerous to sleep like this, he realized in that moment, since he was pretty much useless when it came to sensing any approaching threats, but he also knew that Kagome's unlocked spiritual powers could sense an encroaching demonic aura from miles away, and the realization that he was relying on his wife for protection in his distracted state didn't bother him in the slightest. It'd taken him a while to admit it, even to himself, but he'd entrusted her with not only his life, but also his heart, long before the defeat of Naraku. Now, on that night, in that moment, he had Kagome in his arms, his wife, his mate, and nothing else mattered. He'd waited this long for her; he could wait another month or so until constructed was completed. It wasn't that big of a deal. In the meantime, though, he was never sleeping sitting up against that wall ever again.", "hit_ratio": 4.018018018018018}, {"doc_text": "Whenever she was lonely and wanted company for a night, though, she never had much trouble finding a volunteer.

He wanted to quiz her on her knowledge of Arthurian Mythos, and as he expected she was already tired of the history lesson. When he asked how much she knew about Arthur's legacy, she said she knew enough, and expressed a bit of disdain at how he was setting up to explain it. \"Since I'm keeping it simple, Excalibur was a holy blade of Avalon given to Arthur by one Lady in the Lake. It was said it was returned to the lake. \"Clarent was actually a sword of Arthur's, his peace sword; which he used to make his knights.

This sword, less renowned and powerful than Excalibur, she figured she would have much less trouble finding. Tell me, Acrimonious, what's in it for you?\" Her arms crossed as well, just under her breasts as she waited for her 'sibling' to give an answer to the inquiry. Fear couldn't help but smile wryly when she simply said she wanted after he told her about it. It gave him some pride, really, though it made him wonder if succeeding in working out a deal with Greed was winning with or against a handicap.

The pocketed springs gave a last, long groan, and the couple finally fell into a happy, relieved slumber. Outside, the hazy sky filled with thunder and a storm buffeted the construction of the house. It also hid the sound of the lock clicking, padded footsteps pacing in through the bedroom door and the steady scrape of sharpened metal on the treads of the staircase. Connie quickly gasped.

There was an electrical buzzing and, as he noticed the lights in the room had extinguished, his head turned.

His eyes returned to Mrs. Chaldean. In the gloom b y her legs, a black plastic sack, like those used for rubbish, flapped and crackled. Their gaze met. Some low, light thuds echoed through the building as Mrs. Chaldean climbed the stairwell to the third floor, where her quarters were. Jimmy, breathless, looked to Connie. His eyes rolled to upstairs, as he heard a wheeze of a mattress, much quieter than the racket that Jimmy and Connie had connived to bring about. Jimmy gave a sceptical glance to the room, as if he could see something in the darkness, but shook his head. He felt drowsy and the pillows on the bed next to Connie looked much more inviting now. Finally, it seemed that the ghosts that lurked the corridors of Holman Hall would let their guests slumber. Jimmy slipped into the bed. The sheets crinkled. He felt Connie\u2019s warmth close by, and a hand wandered from his side toward hers, tenting the linen subtly, then meeting the taut flesh. She hummed, and he hummed too, taking a deep breath of her essence. Eyes closed, Jimmy smiled, and his tented hands fell flat on Connie\u2019s thigh, and wandered further in a well-rehearsed dance of the five fingers. He took another deep breath, about to make the final flourish of his act, but the breath stirred him in a way he didn\u2019t expect. He withdrew, feeling a tingling sensation in the back of his mind.

We can go back at any time and change any of the settings. We can also switch to a completely different warping option, or we can turn the warp options off and switch back to the normal text, all without any loss of image quality.

Above 9.0, between 9.0 and 10, the exponent increases dramatically, and warp 10 is theoretically infinite speed. It is worth noting, however, that in All Good Things (the closing Episode of TNG), the scale appears to continue to Factor 14 at this same WF^(10/3) progression. The term Full Impulse seems to be relative, and as per naval tradition, Full Impulse appears to be maximum the engines can provide, which varies from about 0.05C to an explicit 0.8C (in Voyager). In brief, it's very inconsistent (though more inconsistent between eras, i.e. increase: Warp 1 is equal to c, but warp 2 is equal to 8x c.\nEDIT: Incidentally, in this scale, warp 10 is impossible because it's classified as \"infinite speed\", with the ship's speed approaching the asymptote of infinite speed as it adds more decimal places to its speed. Still, even if Warp 9 = 3000 times LS (for example), in Voyager, it was established on screen that Warp 9.9 = 21 473 times LS. Anywhere in between you can have a large range of speeds that can be achieved through say more efficient/powerful Warp drive (recalibrated Warp scale in TNG final episode where they said Warp 13, etc), Slisptream, Transwarp and Coaxial warp drive (to name a few). Slisptream v1 seemed to have equaled 300 ly's per hour at maximum from on-screen dialogue. Slisptream V2 as developed by Voyager crew (who used a number of technologies) in 'Timeless' seemed to have allowed speeds of 10 000 ly's per minute (and if you check the dialogue, it says that the slisptream variance doesn't appear until about 17 seconds into the flight... which doesn't leave much time for Voyager to experience issues and crash into its doom or for future Kim to send the needed data back in time to help disperse the Slipstream). This version of Slipstream even seemed to surpass Borg Transwarp capabilities (at least until the Dauntless and Arturis were assimilated by the Borg, which could have lead to the Collective to improve their TW drives by the end of Voyager series). There are also Soliton Waves which traveled at below Warp 9 (though showed evidence they can increase in speeds), but the thing is that ships using soliton wave technology wouldn't need actual Warp engines (further research into this technology might have yielded SF with better mobile control that didn't require another station at the end to disperse the wave, but could otherwise be done on the go via a ship using the waves to traverse space).", "hit_ratio": 0.26548672566371684}, {"doc_text": "Stretching is important for a full, powerful swing, but it also helps as you carry your bag and make your way along the course.

He was so intruiged by the music played by these elderly harpers that he spent a lot of the rest of his life collecting tunes and information from them across Ireland. Bunting's working method was to sit down with the harper and make a very rapid draft of the music into his pocket notebook as they played. Then later, he would transfer the tune across into his desk notebook, tidying it up, and adding basic piano harmonisation and key signature etc. This procedure (of copying to a new book and adjusting the tune and harmony in the process) could be repeated again and again until Bunting had worked out a romantic piano arrangement to his satisfaction.

Although the ink I used was supposed to be waterproof, it was not, so the sealing of the paper resulted in quite a bit of smearing, so I will be getting a different type next time. This began, as I usually do, with a general, low detail pencil drawing to work out what it will look like and make any small adjustments before using the ink.

At the age of 19, the \"Chazon Ish\" sent him to study in Lakewood, NJ, under the famed Rabbi Aharon Kotler. Rabbi Abadi is a renowned Posek whose students are accomplished rabbis across the globe. Rabbi Abadi was the leading Posek for the entire Lakewood community. Taking something that has almost no value and imbuing it with sanctity is a message for life, and the manner in which we can and should elevate even our most ordinary activities. A Sefer Torah, the five books of Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy) in which are included The Ten Commandments, are the words of G-d dictated to Moses on Mount Sinai, in plain view of all 12 Tribes, the Sons of Israel. It is the most sacred of secrets, the DNA of our identity and the map of our destiny. Its focus is entirely on the message of its 304,805 letters its sparse and cryptic words and their interpretation. We say that Moses conversed with the G-d, as would two friends. Perhaps we should not say, \u201cin spite of this\u201d but \u201cbecause of this\u201d. Humility is the only device that will permit the removal of those obstacles that impede our soul\u2019s urge to commune with G-d. The Torah testifies, \u201cMoses was the most humble of all people\u201d and precisely because of Moses\u2019 humility could he and did he utterly embrace and unreservedly bond with G-d.\nThose letters are described by our Sages OBM, as leaping letters of flames. A Sofer draws for example, a \u2018yod\u2019 (\u05d9) as a short vertical stroke; if is lengthened it becomes \u2018vav\u2019 (\u05d5) by extending the head, a \u2018resh\u2019 (\u05e8) is formed, and if the \u2018resh\u2019 has a flat baseline added to it and a short riser it is transformed into a \u2018mem\u2019(\u05dd).\" All 27 letters are formed with only a few strokes again emphasizing the simplicity of the Torah. There is beauty not in the letters but in the Sofer. The persistence and diligence required both to train and in the actual execution when writing any of the sacred texts is a revelation of the nobility, diligence and beauty within the Sofer. The best quality Torahs are those where the lettering is consistent, achieved by practicing the same stroke over and over again. \"Imagine a bar mitzvah boy or girl coming up for the first time to read the Torah and the \u2018bet\u2019 (\u05d1) in \u2018Bereishit\u2019 (In the beginning, G-d) doesn\u2019t look the same as the \u2018bet\u2019 (\u05d1) in. \"barah\" (create) They\u2019re nice, very artistic, but they\u2019re not consistent.\" These letters are written on parchment, not paper or plastic or cloth. Cloth could be made that would mimic parchment so well that no one but G-d and the user, would know the difference. \"If it\u2019s not made out of parchment, it\u2019s not a Sefer Torah.\" Saddam Hussein attempted to gather all the Sifrey Torah he possibly could and destroy them all. However, one of the officers involved in storing the Torahs slated for destruction realized that a lot of money could be made by selling them to the people who so treasure them. He knew exactly where it came from and saw the hundreds of years of history it had witnessed. However, they wanted a million dollars for each Sefer Torah. \"We would not pay more than its worth; we had to avoid creating an incentive for stealing Sifrey Torah. Torahs are made of parchment because that\u2019s what the law says they must be made from. Nowadays, the most commonly used parchment for Torahs comes from unborn calves; foetuses from cows slaughtered for food. Deerskin was very popular; in fact it is probably the best skin to use because it\u2019s very difficult to remove the ink. In Europe there are Torahs where the hunter\u2019s bullet hole is still in the Torah. Goatskin is strongly marked with dark patches for which a white \"paint\" was developed to cover the parchment. Unfortunately, the paint tends to crack, which in turn cracks the ink and thus invalidates the Torah. The heating and cooling being activated and de-activated, causes expansion and contraction which tends to crack the ink. High to moderate humidity promotes the growth of moulds. For this reason it is also advantageous to have the Sifrey Torah \u201crolled\u201d on a regular basis to give them an opportunity to \u201cbreathe\u201d. The National Museum of Sweden kept a Sefer Torah in its vaults for more than 100 years. However, when the museum permitted the Torah to be authenticated by Rabbi Yitzchak Shteiner, he informed them that what they were protecting so dearly, was not a Torah. Because it had not been used, most of the letters of the Torah had flaked off. The raw animal skin is put in a large tumbler with a lime solution for up to eight hours to remove all of the hair and degrease it. When dry it is called \"klaf\" and cut into rectangles. Now the layers of the dried skin are split into the epidermis (outer layer) and the dermis (inner layer). The parchment used for Sifrey Torah, teffilin and mezuzahs comes from the inner side of the epidermis. There are also two vertical lines to mark the margins between the columns of print. These margins, by tradition, are five fingers wide. Unlike our method of writing on top of the line, soferim hang their writing from the line above. In the earliest times, bamboo shoots were used as writing tools and are still used by some. Duck and chicken feathers are too small, they don\u2019t hold enough ink. One of the first things a sofer learns is how to prepare a quill. It may be written only in outline and filled in afterwards, but the name of G-d must be written with one load of ink. If too large a pocket is made the ink can easily slip out of the quill and make an unholy mess. A slit in the quill promotes even ink flow but most important of all is the penmanship of the sofer. Of course his talent is reflected in the artistic quality of the letter\u2019s shape but it also determines how well the quill behaves. In the hands of a novice the quill is device that makes messes and causes frustrations, in the hands of an accomplished sofer it is a tool of wonderful value. The plant secretes the liquid gall, comprised mainly of tannins, that hardens to become the \"nut\". Gallnut extracts are widely used in pharmaceuticals, food and feed additives, dyes, inks, and metallurgy), which is pulverised and mixed with water. This is to give elasticity to the dried ink. This is most important because it makes the dried ink elastic which prevents it cracking when the Sefer Torah or mezuzah is rolled. According to the law, the ink has to be black like a raven and this is achieved by adding magnesium or copper sulphate crystals. Occasionally in very old Sifrey Toarh the ink has oxidized, a natural reaction through exposure to oxygen in the air, which turns the ink brownish red. In this case it is still Kosher but if after only a short time the colouring changes, the ink is faulty and the sefer is probably not Kosher. Honey is sometimes added to thicken the mixture, and on another dimension this symbolises the sweetness of the Torah. Some have a tradition of adding a concoction made from the seven special species which the Holy Land is blessed with: pomegranates, dates, figs, barely, olives, wheat, and grapes. This is a very special number: it reflects on the human being that has 248 limbs as enumerated in the Mishnah of Ohalos; it reflects on the positive commandments of the Torah and it reflects upon Avraham whose name matches that numerical value. Davidovitch is a famous name amongst the soferim. He wrote a Tikkun to make the columns look more evenly spaced with each column accommodating 62 average letters. There are three different traditions of writing, Ashkenazi, Sephardi and Hasidic. In 1944, that mad dog of infamy, opened a museum in Prague, which documented the planned soon to be extinct Jewish race. A sofer is not just a copyist. He attains a state of mind and heart that connects him with his creator and this Torah that is the conduit between HaShem and His Holy People. A sofer requires three basic skills; how to write the letters, the laws governing the formation of the letters (about 4,000) and how to focus ones mind and heart to be truly connected to Gd. Aside from keeping kosher and strictly observing all the holy days, every morning the sofer should go to the mikvah (ritual bath). When he sits down to write he must actually say \"For the sanctity of the Torah Scroll.\" Since women are not obligated in the Mitzvah of writing a Sefer Torah they are not permitted to write them. If a mistake is made when writing the letters in a word, the letters must be removed and rewritten. Sometimes a scalpel is used to chip and scrape the letters off the parchment. However, if a mistake is made in writing G-d\u2019s name which may never be erased, the parchment bearing the name of G-d must be cut out and a patch glued in its place. According to some traditions, the entire column is removed and replaced. This is done by one person reading aloud each one of the 304,805 letters from an established Tikkun whilst another checks it on the Torah. After the text is written, the parchment sections have to be sewn together into a roll with thread made from the leg sinews of kosher animals. The completed Sefer Torah is sewn onto sticks, \"Atzei Chayim\" (trees/branches of life), in the Sephardic tradition, they are situated inside a beautifully decorated hard case. Some years ago, the Israeli Police Department and Interpol consulted with various rabbis to develop a method to positively identify Sifrey Torah without marking them and thereby stem the increasing trade in stolen Sifrey Torah. This allows the police to keep \u201cfingerprints\u201d of all Sifrey Torah on a database. Since these \u201cfingerprints\u201d are unknown to the thief, they are unable to simply replace a known section to change the \u201cfingerprint\u201d. The final Mitzvah of the Torah is to write a Sefer Torah.", "hit_ratio": 3.6724137931034484}, {"doc_text": "I was working away on doing the darker pen-and-ink shading in the background of the tea circle with a quill dip-pen and bottle of ink when I smacked the bottle and dumped it onto the drawing, the table, and a bit on myself.

According to Proverbs 8.22-26, Wisdom was acquired from God, installed from eternity, and in a intimate relationship with Him. As discussed prior, Wisdom is simply \u201cability\u201d. The first men in Scripture to have been given wisdom were not preachers or priests, they were: tailors (Exodus 28.3); workers in metal (Exodus 31.2-3); women who spun cloth (Exodus 35.26-27); stone cutters, wood workers, and embroiderers (Exodus 35.30-36.3). One of Paul\u2019s teachings, who himself had some ability and wisdom as a tent maker (Acts 18.3), from 1 Thessalonians 4 is quite applicable here: \u201cMake it your ambition to lead a quiet life, to mind your own business, and to work with your hands\u2026\u201d (11) That is a life of wisdom\u2026that is a proverbial life. My first job was framing houses for my uncle Jim. He was a good first boss because he knew how limited my ability was . It was Friday afternoon and it was coming on quitting time. The porch was a full wrap around with tongue and groove slats. Right at the corner of the house, it came off at a 45-degree angle to meet with the adjacent run of porch. As we set the decking, I found myself nearest the wall and reading measurements to the saw man. Very patiently and calmly, after 2-3 meaurements, my uncle Jim stood up, walked over and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you switch me ends before you ruin your weekend?\u201d Craftsmanship done by a master craftsman is a thing to behold. Wisdom is the master Craftsman of creation. He is the hands that would do the building. When I was in youth ministry, I would always show up to games with a Gatorade for the student. It was a dollar and a minute out of the way, but it communicated to them that I actually cared and prepared. This is only accomplished by finding and attaining wisdom. As for \u201cfavor\u201d, as discussed briefly in a previous post, Noah found \u201cfavor\u201d [chen] or \u201cgrace\u201d in the eyes of the Lord. When dealing with 1500 lbs animals, refurbished equipment, or hand me down tools, simple is always better. Murphy\u2019s law, \u201cif it can go wrong, it will go wrong\u201d is offset by Okham\u2019s razor, \u201cthe simplest solution is usually the correct one.\u201d That is why a horse, a saddle, and a rope is still relevant amidst a world that is mechanized. Proverbs is the horse, saddle, and rope book of the Bible. Set among the backdrop of the elegant poetry and beautiful worship compositions of the Psalms, the creative angst and despair of Ecclesiastes, the romance of Song of Solomon, or the deep questions posed by Job, Proverbs is just a down to earth, practical application of the best way to live life. It is a book of simplicity that cuts out all the excess. That\u2019s the kind of life we need more of today. It was Bezalel, who was given \u201cwisdom\u201d [chokmah] to build the Tabernacle in Exodus 31. Just over 25% of the times this word, chokmah, \u201cwisdom\u201d is used in the Old Testament, it is used in the book of Proverbs. But wisdom in middle of Proverbs seems take on person-hood: \u201cshe\u201d stands and calls out\u201d (8.2-3); \u201cI\u201d raise my voice (8.4); \u201cI, wisdom, dwell\u201d (8.12); \u201cI walk\u201d (8.20) and so many more. The classification of wisdom as the female gender, has nothing to do with with the person-hood of wisdom. In the same way that the greek word for wisdom, sophia, is feminine in person, the Hebrew word, chokmah, is a feminine word as are many abstract words in the Hebrew language. Three things about Wisdom in this first section. First, when the Lord \u201cbrought him forth\u201d, the initial thought was that Wisdom was a created entity. The hebrew word qanah can be used of creation, however, much more common is the meaning \u201cto aquire\u201d or \u201cto buy\u201d. Proverbs 4.5-7 uses the word 4 times in 3 verses and not once does it even hint at creation. The word qanah (to acquire) and its homophone (to create) and the confusion between the two, would provide the interpretation that gave rise to the heretical movement of Arianism and its teaching that Jesus was a created being, not to be equated with God. The second issue raised is the \u201cformation\u201d of Wisdom. Theses verse fall into Hebrew poetry structure of parallelism. There are three ways that Hebrew poetry is structured: 1) parallelism, where the second line repeats the idea of the previous; (2) antithetic, where the second line argues against the first; (3) synthetic, where the second line completes or builds upon the first. Wisdom was appointed, the most recent NIV translation says \u201cformed\u201d, from eternity. The hebrew word, nasak, \u201cappoint/formed\u201d is also used in Psalm 2.6 speaking of a king being \u201cinstalled\u201d in his kingdom. Finally, verses 24 and 25 says that Wisdom was \u201cgiven birth\u201d prior to the hills and and the oceans. Once again, was Wisdom a created being or eternal? \u201cTo give birth\u201d would argue a beginning of Wisdom; but this is a complex word. The word is chil. The most common use of the word is used to mean \u201ctremble\u201d, \u201cwound\u201d, or \u201cwrithe\u201d (that would be the Qal stem in Hebrew). It means an intensive action. Simply put, the qal stem is intensified. Instead of \u201che killed\u201d the same word becomes \u201che slaughtered.\u201d As it pertains to our discussion, chil becomes \u201cgive birth\u201d. Speaking from ignorance, I hear that giving birth is way worse than a paper cut. The word is used 7 times in this sense. Twice it is used in abstract: \u201cThe Lord twists the oaks\u201d (Ps. 29.9) and \u201cnorth wind brings rain\u201d (Proverbs 25.23). Which brings us to the final usage which means literally \u201cto give birth\u201d like the doe and fawn (Job 39.1) and Sarah giving birth. (Isaiah 51.2) Abraham was the father, but Sarah gave birth. The father-son relationship is the intention of the Hebrew verb here. So according to Proverbs 8.22-26, Wisdom was acquired from God, installed from eternity, and in a intimate relationship with Him. The second section to look at, verses 27-29, describes Wisdom\u2019s presence at creation. Wisdom was there when God caused \u201cthe heavens to be set in place\u201d. (8.27) Wisdom was present when the waters of the ocean were laid out, when the clouds were established, and when the deeps were dug out. She was a blip on Solomon\u2019s radar; but King Lemuel, he took some time to dwell on her. The structure of the end of Proverbs is unique in its formation. Two things make it stand out from the rest of the book. First, it is a unit. For much of Proverbs, aside from pieces here and there, the author makes statements that stand on their own. The prologue to the book (1.1-9) and Wisdom\u2019s Poem (8-9) being the obvious exemptions. Its a couple verses about obtaining wealth (10.2-5ish); the way to walk (6-9); thoughts on the tongue (10-14); then back to the wealth (15-16); verse 17 is an outlier; then back to the tongue (18-21); the wicked and the righteous (22-30); and finishes with the tongue again (31-32). If you have ever tried to outline the book of James or even the Sermon on the Mount by Jesus, you would know the frustration of trying to put an outline to the book of Proverbs. Lemuel wants to dwell on this topic of the Woman of Noble Character. It is shown in the number of verses she has devoted to her. Twenty-one verses are devoted to describing her character, her worth, her activity. I guess it depends on how you divide it up and how you categorize and group them, but there aren\u2019t many topics that warrant the amount of ink as the wife of noble character. Wisdom, Righteousness, Discipline, Money are on the short list that get more press than her. Its not only the number of verses he devotes to her, it\u2019s the way he arranges them. Each subsequent verse begins with the next letter of the Hebrew alphabet. He begins in verse 10 with the letter aleph: \u201c\u2018isha-chayil\u201c. The translation is \u201ca wife/woman of noble character\u201d. The use of \u2018isha in scripture is a bit ambiguous. The word is used 4 times in four verses; once in 22, 23, 24, and 25. The first two times the NIV translates it as woman, and the last two wife. To say that this only applies to a married woman, rendering \u2018isha as wife, would, I think be hermeneutically arrogant. It is most commonly translated as \u201carmy\u201d or \u201cwealth\u201d. If you remember from the last post, the word for \u201chelper\u201d [\u2018ezer] has military implications. Those are the literal translations. The meaning, the thought, behind the word is \u201cstrength\u201d. Kings are only as strong as their armies and their wealth. Joel and Habakkuk knew the meaning of this word. Habakkuk writes: \u201cThe Lord is my strength [chayil]\u2026\u201d (Hab. 3.19) and Joel adds: \u201cThe Lord thunders at the head of his armies [chayil]\u201d (Joel 2.11). Moving on the second verse (11) beings with batach\u2026the hebrew letter bet, translated as \u201ctrust\u201d. The following verse begins with a gimel. The hebrew word is \u201cgemalathu\u201d meaning \u201cshe will give\u201d. Hebrew (and greek for that matter) is not as confined to sentence structure as the English language is. English sentences are usually constructed as \u201csubject-verb\u201d. The components are generally determined by their location in the sentence. Hebrew, on the other hand uses suffixes to words to denote their function in the sentence. That being said, the order of the sentence is not nearly as important in the Hebrew. He begins verse 10 with noun-adjective; verse 11 with verse-preposition-verb; verse 12 with a verb\u2026and so on. He continues throughout the Hebrew alphabet, all the way through too \u201ctav\u201d. Twenty two letters (or 21 if you combine the letters sin and shin, which are used interchangeably as the Psalmist in 119 does as does King Lemuel) leading the verses about the woman/wife of noble character. Most NIV Bible\u2019s even begin the sections with the Hebrew letter that will lead the sentence in the subsequent sections. On the left side of a piece of paper, write the alphabet vertically with one line per letter. Pick one: animal, college, chemical element, or food. To get the right words, in the correct order, to convey the meaning, to clarify thought, was a stressful and intellectually challenging endeavor\u2026and it was about Taco Bell, something so insignificant. Can you imagine, King Lemuel agonizing over the proper words to get his point across? Can you picture, King Lemuel, being poured into by the Holy Spirit, and the words flowing from his pen as he describes the heroine of the story? The woman of noble character was worth all of the effort. Another character that comes to the forefront of the text of Proverbs is \u201cThe Wife of the Nobel Man\u201d. She is mentioned throughout the book, referenced again and again, but is dwelt upon at the end of the book in chapter 31. She bursts on the scene in chapter 12 where we find that she is the\u201d crown of her husband!\u201d (Proverbs 12.4) The Jews had a principle of interpretation called \u201cFirst Text Principle\u201d. Essentially, it means that when a topic comes up in a text, the interpreter must go back to where the concept is spoken of first in Scripture. For example, when we read from the pen of Paul: \u201cFor it is by grace we are saved, through faith\u2013and this is not from yourselves but the gift of God\u2013not by works, so that no one can boast.\u201d (Ephesians 2.8-9) For a Jewish interpreter their mind would immediately be taken to Genesis 6 and the flood narrative where Noah \u201cfound favor [chen] in the eyes of the Lord\u201d. (Genesis 6.8) The Hebrew word for \u201cfavor\u201d can also be translated as \u201cgrace\u201d. And you know the rest of the story. For our purposes and the wife of noble character, the study must begin in Genesis 2 with the first woman and the first wife. Man was alone on the earth and for the first time in the story of God and Man, \u201cit was not good\u201d. (Genesis 2.18) So God made for/from Adam a \u201chelper\u201d [\u2018ezer] for him. This word carries the idea of reinforcements in battle (Psalm 20.2; 121.11-12; Isiah 30.5) Eve was given to Adam in order to come alongside him in ministry and in life. She was to rally to support him. I\u2019m not absolving Adam, he was right there with her, and as the man should have intervened; however, his \u201chelper\u201d would become his\u2026whatever his anti-helper is. The wife of noble character is the crowning achievement of creation and the heroine of the book of Proverbs.", "hit_ratio": 6.568965517241379}, {"doc_text": "The Hebrew approach to hermeneutics (the theories of interpretation) views four levels of interpretation: 1) Peshat, the literal, direct meaning; 2) Remez, an allegorical significance; a hint of something deeper; 3) Derash, the homiletical, or practical application; and 4) Sod, the mystical or hidden meaning.

He relieved my headache and gave me a lot of freedom of movement in both my neck and back, so the flight was fine. My therapist was very nice. Her touch was the perfect pressure for me and exactly to my liking. So tired of therapists that tickle me \u00be of the way into the massage because they tire out, Kristin was 100% all the way. After, she gave me some tips to live more ergonomically well and a great stretching example. He has excellent knowledge of the human body \u2013 the bones and muscles. Once you provide all facts about your injury, he determines what treatment might help you; just check the \u201ctreatment\u201d section to see all. With Shem you got a feeling, his therapy is not just a job for him but he appears really wanting to help. I am so relieved to have found a professional, knowledgeable, and talented massage therapist: Shem does incredible work! Jaco R : Shem is a great therapist and listen to your body\u2019s needs and identify the problem spots throughout the massage and focus on these areas. He worked on my shoulder&neck and was very painful at the time, but feels very good later. I will do the exercise that he taught me and hope to work with him to get pain free healthy body! It is not only an immediate stress relieve, it brings the system back to balance, increase energy and vitality. Shem began treating me for a shoulder injury\u2026.That\u2019s over 4 years ago. He is simply the best. I found Shem by accident after my back went out and I\u2019m so grateful that he was able to treat me. He was, quite simply, amazing and I\u2019ve recommended him to a number of people already. Everything about his business appeals to me: the online booking, quiet music, as well as his demeanor and knowledge. Shem appears to be very knowledgeable about human body and its functions and has excellent knowledge of his profession. I would not hesitate to recommend him to anybody. This was the first massage I have ever had where after walking out of the session, I instantly felt improvements in my problem areas. He brings such knowledge to the table, literally. I look forward to the next sessions to come. Shem is undoubtedly one of the best this city has to offer. His treatments are truly innovative and he uses his education to his clients\u2019 advantage. All the discomforts on my back were gone after the first visit. He is very genuine and professional. As always, Shem sorts out my neck and back, or wherever the aches and pains are. I\u2019ve recommended him to several friends and colleagues, and they are all very pleased with the treatments. He has a great personality too\u2026. Zoe M. says: As always, fantastic. Every time after the treatment I feel like a new person!!!! All the small pains, tightness and stress I went in with were gone and I felt as relaxed as if I had been on vacation. His skill and knowledge will take care of your physical side and his great personality will definitely put you at ease and even make you laugh as he eases the pains away. The treatments have given new life to the tired and stiff muscles and eased or removed the pain from some chronic sore spots.", "hit_ratio": 1.1896551724137931}, {"doc_text": "As the reputation of the Baal Shem Tov grew, many joined the new Chassidic movement. Tales of the wonders performed by the Baal Shem Tov, his emphasis on the joyous service of God, and his refection of abstention and asceticism could only increase the Maggid's suspicions of the new movement. The pain in his legs was excruciating at times, and he and his family sought medical help throughout Europe. He tried various remedies, without success, and was relegated to walking on crutches. The pain did not bother him as much as the energy it sapped from his Torah studies. According to one, R. Mendel of Bar, a student of the Baal Shem Tov, came to Turchin and stayed with a local Jewish patron. the Maggid, who had been fasting daily for eight weeks, lived next door. Impressed with what he heard, R. Mendel advised him to approach the Baal Shem Tov for a cure. \"Better to take refuge in HaShem than to trust in man\" (Tehillim 118:8), replied the Maggid. Returning to the Baal Shem, R. Mendel told him, \"I saw a beautiful 'vessel' in Turchin.\" \"I've seen him for years,\" replied the Baal Shem. \"I yearn for him to come to me.\" Indeed, the Baal Shem Tov labored to win over the outstanding people destined by Providence to disseminate his teachings. Meanwhile, the Maggid's family urged him to make the journey to Medzibozh. \"How much longer will you endanger your health?\" asked his wife, unable to see him in such pain. \"How much longer will you stubbornly refuse to humble yourself with even one visit to the Baal Shem Tov? Surely he can cure you.\" He finally agreed to go. I'm told you have decided to come to me, to take refuge in the shadow of the fear of the Lord. If, Heaven forbid, I don't find favor with you, the choice is yours. Heaven is my witness that your spirit will be doubly rewarded, the thirst of your soul will be quenched, and you will provide support for me as well. To tell the truth, I see an auspicious sign in the student who bears this letter. Although I know you have opposed our ways, I hope that when you come, God willing, you will \"taste the tree of life and live forever.\" there are very lofty matters to attend to, so come quickly and remain here. En route to the Baal Shem, the Maggid's wagon kept breaking down. He wrote the Baal Shem Tov that he had been delayed. \"My heart tells me I've been mistaken until now,\" he added. He finally arrived in Medzibozh on Erev Shabbos. Upon meeting the Baal Shem Tov, R. Dov Ber began to relate everything that had happened on the way. the Baal Shem interrupted him and continued the story himself, noting each problem with the wagon and where it had occurred. The Maggid then asked for a cure for his sickness. \"My horses don't eat matzos!\" the Baal Shem scolded. Bewildered, the Maggid broke into a sweat and went outside to collect himself. Spotting R. Yaakov of Onipol, he requested that R. Yaakov ask the Baal Shem why he hadn't fulfilled the mitzvah of loving the stranger. While he sympathized with the Maggid, R. Yaakov couldn't speak so harshly to his Rebbe - at least not directly. Instead, he passed through the Baal Shem's house, and on his way out he shouted, \"A forlorn Jew sitting outside wants to know why the master doesn't love strangers.\" The Baal Shem immediately gathered ten men to placate R. Dov Ber. Later, as the Maggid lay bedridden, the Baal Shem recited Tehillim by his side for two weeks. \"At first I wanted to cure you through prayer,\" he told R. Dov Ber. \"But now I see that I must apply a medicinal remedy.\" In another version of the encounter, the Baal Shem offered the Maggid a choice of two cures: sheimos (a Kabbalistic remedy involving the names of God), which would give him immediate strength and vigor, or a medicinal treatment, which would take much longer and be far less effective. \"I am unworthy of being healed by sheimos,\" the Maggid replied. His illness was cured medically, but he remained weak to the end of his life. The Baal Shem remarked that had the Maggid chosen the Kabbalistic treatment, he would have become healthy enough to \"chop a wagonful of wood.\" Years later, when R. Dov Ber's frailty made his learning more and more difficult, he openly regretted his choice. A second version of the encounter between the founder of Chassidus and the man who would succeed him begins with a key figure - the Pnei Yehoshua, rabbi of Lvov and one of R. Dov Ber's mentors. The Pnei Yehoshua was once learning when someone rushed into the Beis Medrash and announced that a man outside had asked to see him immediately on business. The Pnei Yehoshua went out, greeted the stranger, and asked him what was so urgent. \"Your shochet has been selling treife meat for over ten years,\" the man replied breathlessly. \"Send for him and see for yourself.\" With that, he sped off in his carriage before the Pnei Yehoshua could ask who he was. Later, when the shochet (slaughterer) finally confessed, the Pnei Yehoshua realized that the stranger must have been the famous Baal Shem Tov. Some months later, the Baal Shem reappeared outside the Beis Medrash. This time the Pnei Yehoshua came out immediately and recognized him. \"When R. Dov Ber lodges here, tell him in my name that his legs will not be well unless he comes to me,\" declared the Baal Shem. Before his departure, the Pnei Yehoshua advised his son-in-law to consult R. Dov Ber whenever necessary and the Maggid developed a warm, stimulating relationship with the new rabbi of Lvov. Obstinately ignoring his family's urgings to see the Baal Shem Tov, R. Dov Ber soon grew incurably lame. Desperate, his family asked the rabbi of Lvov to visit his sick friend. Perhaps he could convince him to go to the Baal Shem. When he suggested to R. Dov Ber that he travel to the Baal Shem, the Maggid expressed his reservations about the \"miracle-worker.\" \"Why not go see for yourself?\" the rabbi suggested. \"Surely you cannot judge without seeing the Baal Shem in person.\" This approach appealed to the Maggid, and he set out for Medzibozh. On the road, however, he began to wonder whether a scholar was permitted to take so much time from his studies. At the Friday night seudah (meal), the Maggid listened attentively, hoping to hear teachings affecting Heaven and Earth. \"Once I was traveling with Alexi, the wagoneer,\" recalled the Baal Shem. \"We came to the middle of the forest and there was no more hay for the horses. We didn't know what to do until, thank God, a non-Jew passed by with his horse and gave us some hay.\" With that the Baal Shem said Birkas HaMazon and the meal was over. The Maggid was horrified. \"Instead of delving into the depths of man's soul,\" he thought, \"he speaks about horses!\" He considered absenting himself from the second Shabbos seudah, lest he waste even more time. But he didn't want to embarrass his host and hoped that this time things would be different. The next day, the Baal Shem recollected how he and Alexi had once traveled through parched fields under a scorching sun, with no water to drink and no spring or well in sight. They wouldn't reach the nearest town until evening. Suddenly, like a Godsend, a non-Jew appeared carrying water buckets. When they asked what he was doing in such a remote place, he replied, \"I don't know myself. He sent me on a three-day journey through the forest and fields with these buckets, and today is the third day.\" The Maggid understood that these stories were intended to demonstrate HaShem's providence. It was the Baal Shem's way of instilling emunah in people by means of parables and mundane stories. When the Maggid replied affirmatively, the Baal Shem asked him to explain a passage in Eitz Chaim (Tree of Life) by Rav Chaim Vital, a disciple of the Ari, z\"l.\nThe Maggid studied the passage for a few minutes and proceeded with his explanation. \"You don't know anything!\" declared the Baal Shem. The Maggid reread the passage. \"My interpretation is correct,\" he maintained. \"Tell me yours and we'll see who's right.\" The Baal Shem grasped the book, and his face began to shine. He told R. Dov Ber to stand. Light filled the room, and the Baal Shem was encircled by fire. At this point, the Maggid could no longer stand, and the Baal Shem showed him to a bed. The Maggid later related, \"I no longer saw him, but for two hours I heard sounds and beheld awesome fire and lightning. I became very frightened and fainted.\" The Baal Shem later told the Maggid, \"Your interpretation was correct, but you were learning only the 'body' of the hidden Torah. Now you have penetrated its 'soul.'\" R. Dov Ber remained in Medzibozh for an extended period, and became a disciple of the Baal Shem Tov, learning great wisdom and deep secrets, and clinging to him with his heart and soul. R. Dov Ber answered by recounting his mystical experience with the Eitz Chaim. \"I looked into the Baal Shem's face and thought, 'Could this be a creature like us, a mortal? This resolved all my doubts, for one can question his fellow man, but not a Heavenly creature.\" The meeting of the founder of Chassidus and his successor was both fateful and mysterious. Like most Torah scholars, R. Dov Ber fully expected a meeting of minds, an incisive debate, an exchange of ideas and chiddushim. What he heard, instead, were cryptic words and seemingly simple stories. This meeting was, for the next head of the Chassidic movement, an unforgettable lesson in the power of simplicity and the limitations of a scholarship which does not reach into the inner soul of the Torah. The Talmud states: \"One cannot compare someone who reviews his learning one hundred times with one who does so one hundred one times\" (Chagigah 9b). Before he met the Baal Shem Tov, it was said of R. Dov Ber that there wasn't a single work, including the works of the Kabbalah, that he hadn't learned one hundred one times. Nevertheless, his learning with the Baal Shem far surpassed anything he had studied before. He was amazed by the Baal Shem's grasp of the \"soul\" of the subject. Indeed, it is said that once, when hearing the Baal Shem expound the work of the early Kabbalists, he touched the Baal Shem's hand to convince himself that such wisdom could come from a flesh-and-blood mortal. Despite his poor health, the Maggid learned with the Baal Shem in Medzibozh every night. In these lessons the Baal Shem passed on to him many secrets and much hidden knowledge: the language of birds and trees, Divine Names, and Unifications. Together, they pored over the Kabbalistic works Ma'ayan Chochmah and Raziel HaMalach. Once, learning with the Baal Shem became so intense that the Maggid fainted and unconscious for several hours. The Baal Shem recognized the greatness of the Maggid from the beginning. He told one of his disciples, R. Chaim of Krasna: \"When the Maggid came to me, he was already a pure, golden menorah. All that was needed was to light the candles....\"\nOn another occasion, he declared, \"If the Maggid were healthy enough to immerse in the mikveh, Moshiach would come immediately, for this act would inspire mankind to repent.\" The Maggid eventually wanted to return home, but the Baal Shem Tov pleaded with him to stay: \"Don't leave, I need you. An unused well can dry up, but one whose waters are drawn gushes abundantly.\" \"People think of my grandfather, the Maggid, as a student of the Baal Shem Tov,\" related R. Yisrael of Rizhin. \"It was not so: they taught each another. But my grandfather was weak and sickly, while the Baal Shem was strong and healthy, and able to absorb more.\" The Baal Shem once expressed this himself to R. Dov Ber: \"What is the difference between you and me? But I can effect this by merely thinking, whereas you must marshal your will.\" Not everything the Maggid learned in Medzibozh was taught through seforim. When the Maggid asked the Baal Shem Tov to explain why the Zohar states that the verse \"And these are the judgments...\" (Shmos 21:1), refers to the secret of reincarnation, he told his disciple to go to a forest and stand near a tree by a stream. the Maggid did so, and soon a well-dressed, wealthy-looking man came by, rested in the shade of the tree, and drank from the stream. He then left, but forgot his wallet. Another passerby found the forgotten wallet, pocketed it, and walked off. Before he could close his eyes, the first man came back in search of his lost wallet, accused the poor man of its theft, and beat him relentlessly. The Maggid, perplexed, returned to Medzibozh, where his mentor explained what had taken place. \"In their first incarnation on this earth,\" said the Baal Shem Tov, \"one man took another to court, demanding a certain sum of money. Though the man's claim was well-founded, the judge negligently dismissed the case. \"In their return to this earth, the man who actually owed the money lost his wallet, which contained just the sum under dispute. The man who ought to have collected that sum in court found the wallet. The pauper had been, in his first incarnation, the judge, so he was roundly beaten because he'd caused the debtor to sin by keeping money not rightfully his. Thus, each got what he deserved! That, then,\" he concluded, \"is the meaning of the Zohar - 'the secret of reincarnation.'\" \"Why are you followers called chassidim?\" the Maggid once asked the Baal Shem Tov. \"Our Sages say Chassidus is greater than sanctity, humility, fear of sin, Divine inspiration, and even resurrection of the dead.\" \"We learn that one who burns his cut fingernails is called a 'Chassid,'\" replied the Baal Shem. \"Though it is very difficult to burn fingernails, the chassid does so to prevent others from being harmed. He sacrifices himself for others, going beyond the letter of the law, and completely nullifies himself. This, then, is Chassidus: going beyond the letter of the law in mitzvos between man and HaShem, and between man and his fellow man.\" R. Dov Ber considered the Baal Shem Tov a purely spiritual being. He related, \"I once beseeched Heaven to show me someone whose limbs and sinews were completely sanctified. I was shown the Baal Shem Tov, but with no semblance of a body, just a pure flame. \"One erev Yom Kippur, at the Baal Shem's table, I saw him as a flame of fire: His hands were fiery and so was his food. The Baal Shem later revealed to me that at that moment he had learned the insights gained by Moshe Rabbenu when he ascended Mount Sinai and remained there for forty days and nights without food.\" Indeed, the Maggid asserted, \"I am greater than all Baal Shem Tov's disciples. For only I have seem him elevate every item of food and drink he puts into his mouth.\" Another erev Yom Kippur, the Baal Shem's tallis slipped out of his gartel. Suddenly, he was overcome with fear of HaShem. He was so overwhelmed that he almost fell, and when he grabbed a table for support, he declared, \"Master of the Universe, I didn't know my Rebbe had such awe of You!\" R. Moshe of Kubrin related that many years after the Baal Shem's passing, the Maggid found a handkerchief among his personal effects. When he noticed some snuff left on it by the Baal Shem, he was seized with such fear that he fainted, and it took great effort to revive him. R. Moshe of Kubrin also told of two relatives of the Baal Shem who asked him to settle a dispute. As R. Dov Ber sat down before them, he suddenly heard the Baal Shem's footsteps in an adjoining room. Fearful that this eavesdropping might jeopardize his impartiality, he rose and declared, \"By the power of the Torah and the court, whoever need not be here should leave.\" The Baal Shem obeyed the decree and left. \"Despite the Maggid's great fear of his Rebbe,\" concluded R. Moshe \"his fear of God was even greater!\" In return for a favor, R. Shneur Zalman of Liadi once asked the Maggid to reveal the Baal Shem Tov's essence. After careful thought, he commented, \"Had he lived in the times of the Tannaim, he would have been a wonder; in the era of the Prophets, an innovation; and, in the period of the Patriarchs, noteworthy.\" Had R. Shneur Zalman not heard it from his Rebbe the Maggid, he wouldn't have believed the Baal Shem Tov mortal. Besides studying under the Baal Shem Tov in Medzibozh, the Maggid was being groomed to succeed him. Some say the Baal Shem saw this as soon as the Maggid arrived, never proclaiming it but alluding to it at times. Certainly, the Maggid was particularly singled out for honor by his new-found Rebbe. Dov Ber ben Chavah: For a salvation of body and soul, a complete recovery for his sick legs, the purification of his soul, spirit, and body by the light of the holy Torah, and true emunas chachomim [faith in the Sages] for him and his household, among all Israel. It was an extraordinary gesture: receiving a kvittel from the founder of Chassidus himself! No doubt, the Maggid of Mezritch was the only person ever so honored. When the Maggid left his Rebbe to head home, the Baal Shem placed his hands on his protege's head and blessed him. The Maggid tried to pull away, but the Baal Shem grasped his hands and placed them on his head.", "hit_ratio": 8.818965517241379}, {"doc_text": "Then, harnessing his best carriage and horses and taking his coachman, he returned to the Baal Shem Tov with his wife. The Baal Shem Tov told them, \u201cIf you want children, you will have to agree to become poor, so poor that you will literally have nothing more than a loaf of bread. You will have to ask people for charity and even go begging from door to door.\u201d Once the wealthy man\u2019s wife agreed, the man himself agreed. On the way home, they stopped in a shtetl near their town, and stayed in an expensive hotel. He also heard from the hotel guests that all his possessions had burned to the ground. He could no longer travel home, because he was a debtor. So he dismissed his coachman, and sold his horse and carriage to make some money. He moved into a small shtetl, rented a poor apartment and stayed there until his wife told him the good news: she was pregnant. He gave whatever small amount of money that remained to his wife, and he went out into the world, traveling with the riffraff, begging from door to door. Jews, who are \u201cmerciful and children of the merciful,\u201d supported them from their charity boxes. The once-wealthy man traveled with the riffraff deep into Germany. He was happy with his lot, for he was sure that at home his wife was already bringing up their child. However, one wintry Saturday night, as he was warming himself at the oven-fireplace in a beis medrash, he gave a deep sigh. The shamash asked him why he was sighing. He answered that he wanted a fresh glass of tea from a samovar. He recalled how, when he had once been wealthy, many Jews had drunk tea at his own house\u2014and he compared that to his situation now. The shamash was moved. He immediately brought him to the richest man in town. He took him into the kitchen and asked the servant woman to give him a glass of tea from the samovar. There was a half-open door between the kitchen and the salon. And from the salon the once-wealthy man heard weeping. He asked the servant woman what the weeping was about. She told him that the master of the house is very rich and even has his own ships at sea. In recent years he lost his wife and two adult children, from whom no more was left than a son from one and a daughter from the other. He arranged for the marriage of these two to each other, and he gave them control of his business affairs. But every Saturday night, they come to their grandfather, give him the business figures, and afterwards, she hears weeping. The guest told the servant woman to tell the master of the house that he can help. She did so, and the master of the house immediately called him in. He told the guest that a tragedy had overtaken his granddaughter: she was unable to become ritually pure [and thus have relations with her husband]. As soon as she would come out of the mikveh, she would again become ritually impure. And so his grandson and granddaughter come to him every Saturday night, crying and asking him to allow them to get divorced. The guest assured the master of the house that the Baal Shem Tov from Poland could certainly help him. The Baal Shem Tov might want to come in person, and that would involve great expenses. (At that time, the Baal Shem Tov used to travel on his own to the needy in order to sanctify the name of heaven and to show the Jews that God has compassion on them and listens to the prayers of their tzaddikim). The master of the house immediately hired a coachman to travel with the guest directly to the Baal Shem Tov in Mezhibozh. He also sent a letter along with the guest, and promised that if the Baal Shem Tov were willing to come himself, he would pay whatever the Baal Shem Tov requested. In those days, the trip from Germany to Mezhibozh, by horse and carriage, took several weeks. When they arrived in Mezhibozh, the Baal Shem Tov told the coachman to go home, while he kept the guest [the formerly wealthy man] with him over Shabbos. Immediately after Havdalah on Saturday night, the Baal Shem Tov had his gentile servant, Alexia, harness his horse and wagon and bring along the guest. When they left town, he told Alexia to tie the reins to the wagon, turn his back to the horses, and let them go on their own. The guest saw towns and villages flit by just as if the horses and wagon were flying through the air. They heard the cry of an infant coming from the top of a tree. The Baal Shem Tov told Alexia to wait there, and he and the guest walked over to the inn. There they found over ten Jews reciting Psalms, and the innkeeper and his family in great distress. Obeying the request of the Baal Shem Tov, the guest asked the people, \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d He was told that the wife of the innkeeper had a number of times given birth to boys. Each time, on the vach nacht (the night of watching, before the circumcision), it seemed as if some changeling had been exchanged for her son\u2014then this apparent changeling suffered for a few hours, and died. And so this time the innkeeper had brought a quorum of Jews from the town to remain awake with the mother the entire night, learning Torah and reciting Psalms in order to guard the new-born child. A few minutes later, the guest came back to the inn carrying a child in his arms. The Baal Shem Tov told him to give the child to the mother. The Baal Shem Tov and the guest again sat in Alexia\u2019s wagon, and the horses again flew as before, until they came to a stop deep in Germany at the house of the rich grandfather. Coming into the house, they met the two grandchildren weeping in the presence of their grandfather, as they did every Saturday night. The grandfather and grandchildren were filled with great joy when they saw the guest with the Baal Shem Tov, whom they did not recognize. The guest replied, \u201cThe coachman is traveling in the natural way, so he will first come in the normal period of time. But we came here miraculously. We only left Mezhibozh at the beginning of the evening, and our trip was interrupted with a miraculous event\u201d (the story with the saved child). The Baal Shem Tov sent someone to call the town shamash (who, as shamash of the Chevra Kadisha and the Chevra Nosim, was involved with burying the dead, and so was not a fearful man). He commanded him to light his lantern and enter the bath. He should carry the Baal Shem Tov\u2019s stick into the mikveh room he should carry the Baal Shem Tov\u2019s stick, and say loudly: \u201cThe Baal Shem Tov is here in town, and he decrees that you leave this mikveh.\u201d The shamash obeyed. As soon as he said these words, there was a great commotion in the mikveh room, and a voice answered him, \u201cIs it not that Rabbi Israel Baal Shem Tov has chased us out of Poland? Now, does he also want to chase us out of Germany?\u201d And there was a great wind that blew out the lantern. The shamash grew frightened and barely escaped with his life, and back to the Baal Shem Tov. Then the Baal Shem Tov himself went, taking along the shamash and the guest. He stood with the lantern in the mikveh room and told the shamash and the guest to go down to the mikveh. The shamash should strike the water with the Baal Shem Tov\u2019s stick, using all his force. When the shamash did so, they could hear a deep groan from the mikveh, as though someone had been killed. The Baal Shem Tov lit the mikveh with the lantern, and they saw that the water turned had red, the color of blood. Then the Baal Shem Tov sent for the rabbi of the town. He told him to drain the mikveh and kasher it with milk [? ], in accordance with the law. He added that from now on, the granddaughter would be able to purify herself according to the law of Moshe and Israel and that she would have children. The grandfather immediately the grandfather ordered his grandchildren to bring the accounts from the books, and on the spot he paid the guest with ready cash. The Baal Shem Tov, the guest, the rabbi, the shamash, the grandfather and the grandchildren ate a joyful melave malka together. The Baal Shem Tov took his leave and arrived came at the inn in time for the circumcision. The innkeeper, the grandfather and his grandchildren, and the guest were all helped through the prayers of the Baal Shem Tov.", "hit_ratio": 2.9655172413793105}, {"doc_text": "Mara is very uncomfortable with the way she is dressed and made up by the female servants in the house.

I\u2019ve met people who say they\u2019re from a small town, and then I find out they had more than five stoplights \u2013 that is not a small town. My graduating class had 82 people in it, most of whom I had been in school with since kindergarten. The literal edge of town: my house, street, my neighbor\u2019s house, corn field. Growing up in this small town felt like torture. Everyone knew everything about me and my family, and it felt like there were always a million eyes on me. I felt like I was on a small, corn-covered island. You may think that with all the beach hopping opportunities, happy hours, and island-y things to do it sounds silly to want to see a movie. And we didn\u2019t, for the first six months we lived here. After we had settled in, however, we were more than happy to enjoy air-conditioning for a couple of hours and have a little taste of stateside normalcy.

It\u2019s always an exciting time when there is a county fair or other town-wide event taking place in a small town. You may get lucky and get out of school early to attend the festivities.

You can\u2019t travel on waterfront with an ounce of ease, and many businesses close so their staffs can party it up with the rest of the island.

I\u2019ve always been better at receiving directions with street names. When you learn to drive in a town that has really one major street (Broadway St. \u2013 very aspirational), it\u2019s not hard to figure out where everything is. It\u2019s a whole new experience to see an army of Safari taxis full of tourists clogging the one-lane road, or slowing down as to not hit the donkey. Ironically, instead of following a combine at a glacial pace, I now get stuck behind water trucks. When you don\u2019t really have many diner options in a small town, the old men drink their coffee at McDonald\u2019s. In my St. Thomas neighborhood, the patriarchs of the community gather in the early morning for a quick beer at the convenience store. They sit like gargoyles on the bench outside the store and monitor the comings and goings of the people in their island cars. If you\u2019re a friendly midwesterner, you wave. Nearly a year of waving later, I\u2019m finally getting a head nod. They\u2019ll chat with you about your family, the current weather, and then remind you how you were in diapers when they first watched you eat corn on the cob like you\u2019re buying there. I hated growing up in that small town, but now it\u2019s comforting to have some of the same things surrounding me here on this small island. I\u2019m proud to be an Iowan, because living there made me appreciate the small things in life. Like taking care of the things you have, because new things aren\u2019t as readily available.

Lysenin, a 297 amino acid pore forming toxin extracted from the earthworm E. foetida, inserts hexameric channels in natural and artificial membranes containing sphingomyelin. Although the structure of the channel is not yet solved, previous studies of the lysenin monomeric structure and interaction with membranes indicate the presence of local positive charges within the protein\u2019s structure. Consequently, we hypothesized that highly charged organic anions such as ATP, ADP, and AMP may interact with the channel and alter its functionality. Here we show that the macroscopic conductance of the channels was diminished by addition of various adenosine phosphates in a charge and concentration-dependent manner. Buffer-exchange experiments demonstrated that the current inhibition is reversible, pointing out a potential electrostatic mechanism of interaction between channels and anions which implies binding. Hill analysis provided further insights into the inhibition process and indicated a positive cooperativity between binding events. In addition, the I-V plots recorded in the presence of increasing inhibitor concentration demonstrate a significant rightward shift of the voltage-induced gating profile. The reduced effects elicited by AMP as compared with ATP and ADP, the reversibility of the inhibition, and the strong dependency of the observed effects on the ionic strength point out an electrostatic mechanism of interaction which may yield partial occlusion of the channels and modulation of the voltage-induced gating. National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA. The size and shape of the exocytic fusion pore directly modulates the release of vesicle cargoes like insulin, hormones, and neurotransmitters. Though a number of proteins have been implicated in fusion pore regulation, the molecular details of this process and how these proteins work together to shape the membrane are largely unknown.

BOSTON \u2013 Louis Coleman III has been charged today in federal court in Boston with the kidnapping of Jassy Correia, who had been missing since Feb. 24, 2019. Coleman, 32, of Providence, R.I., has been charged with one count of kidnapping, resulting in death. Coleman was arrested on Thursday, Feb. 28, 2019, in Delaware and will appear in federal court in Delaware on Monday, March 4 at a time to be determined. According to the charging document, after learning of the disappearance of Correia, law enforcement reviewed surveillance tape from outside of the Venu nightclub, the last place Correia had been seen by her friends, which showed Correia leaving the area and entering a vehicle with a man later identified as Coleman. Surveillance footage from Coleman\u2019s Providence, R.I., apartment building showed Coleman, at about 4:15 a.m. on Sunday, Feb. 24, 2019, parking and exiting the vehicle, and then returning a short time later carrying a blanket. He then walked from the car to the front of the building carrying a body with long hair and clothing consistent with the description of Ms. Correia. Once he entered the building, surveillance video showed Coleman dropping the victim on the floor and dragging her towards the elevator, and subsequently towards his apartment unit. It is alleged that on Feb. 26, 2019, surveillance video from the defendant\u2019s apartment building showed Coleman enter the apartment building with Walmart shopping bags. Law enforcement subsequently obtained video surveillance and a receipt from a Walmart in Providence, R.I., that revealed Coleman had purchased three Tyvek suits, duct tape, two candles, electrical tape, one mask, surgical gloves, two pairs of safety goggles, an odor respirator and CLN release bleach bath. At approximately 9:58 p.m. on Feb. 27, 2019, Coleman is seen on video surveillance entering the apartment building with what appeared to be a new, large suitcase. At 1:15 a.m., on Feb. 28, 2019, Coleman is seen in the video wheeling the suitcase away from his apartment unit towards the elevator, eventually out of the building and into the parking lot where his vehicle was. Coleman appeared to have difficulty lifting the suitcase into the trunk of his car. Later in the day on Feb. 28, 2019, a search warrant was executed at Coleman\u2019s apartment, where two packages of hooded coveralls and two respirator masks were recovered. A sofa with four large cushions, one of which was missing a cover, was also observed. In a dumpster outside of the apartment complex, white trash bags, a bag containing plastic sheets, men\u2019s jeans with bleach stains and a belt, a white nylon hooded coverall, an empty box of baking soda, clear safety goggles, a respirator mask, duct tape packaging, rubbing alcohol, Walmart bags, used plastic gloves, an empty package from a car air freshener, three empty packages of purifying charcoal and a sponge were recovered. Officers discovered the victim\u2019s body in the trunk of Coleman\u2019s vehicle, wrapped in a sofa cushion cover, which was inside of a black trash bag, inside of a large suitcase that matches the suitcase Coleman was observed bringing into his apartment on Feb. 27, 2019. The victim had significant bruising, a bloodied face, was bound with gray duct tape, and was covered in what is believed to be baking soda. A duffle bag, a pair of new long-handled loppers, plastic garbage bags, clothing, a red plastic gas container, a green butane lighter, black gloves, charcoal air purifiers, air fresheners, tinted safety glasses, plastic Walmart bags, work towels, cloth work-gloves, a new set of DeWalt pliers, a laptop, a computer hard-drive/tower, and disinfectant wipes were also recovered in Coleman\u2019s vehicle.

I sprint to the edge of the empty hayfield, and stand at the threshold, catching my breath. Rebecca says nothing as I step past the first row of trees, and let the woods envelop me. I think about calling out for her, but without a name, the idea seems a little silly. I hear my name, rattling between the trees, calling me home for supper. She smiles. \u201cI\u2019d like that a lot,\u201d she says. I make my way slowly back to the house, new and old voices mingling in my mind. It\u2019s nearly dark, but the clearing is still bathed in honey-light. \u201cThank you,\u201d she murmurs, her smile returning a bit. \u201cI\u2019m glad!\u201d She holds me there a moment, in her gaze; I\u2019m unable to think. Rebecca whispers, wordless chatter that feels like a warning. \u201cIs your\u2026 grave in the woods?\u201d I ask quietly. She nods, but her expression seems uncertain. Before I can react, she slips back to stand in front of the trunk of a birch tree. She reaches out her arm, and swings it back, then forward again, slowly. Her arm should be hitting the trunk, but it\u2019s not. I reach out, and mimic her movements. I wince as my hand hits the trunk. Giggling, she glides toward me, through the trunk, and smiles. I step back, but my foot catches, and I fall onto the soft undergrowth. Through my tears I see the girl, her expression concerned, genuine. At her words, the fear of being tricked surges. Her voice trails off and she looks towards the clearing. I follow her eyes; the clearing is still sunny, the light a golden syrup, cutting angled rays in the air, pouring on the grass. I jerk my head left, startled, unsure of what I heard. I find myself staring at the eyes of a girl. She leans forward, leaving five steps between us, examining me with nearsighted curiosity. I step forward cautiously, but she slides back as I do, keeping the distance between us. I move slowly among the thin trunks, feeling the soft bounce of layered leaves under me.

Given water and a little room to grow, some good soil and sun, a little unsuspecting nugget can transform into a surprisingly beautiful, unique organism. Or, to our epicurean delight \u2013 watermelon, tomatoes, peppers, eggplant broccoli, basil, beets, alpine strawberries, lettuce, kale, chard and too many other tasty edible plants to mention. To read the seed catalogs, dream of the garden, purchase the seed, hold the packets, is all about pure creative intention and maybe some planning. A beautiful place for the mind and body to dwell, in the sway of imaginative bounty and abundance if, like me, you are OCD about seeds. But the needle skids the record when the shovel hits the dirt. So there it is, dirt and the newly planted seed, you can\u2019t see it anymore but it\u2019s in there and it is supposed to become something. Most strawberries are not planted as seed but are cultivated by cutting off smaller plants along rooting stems or by root divisions. Alpine strawberries, the tiny little fruits that burst with flavor and can be found in woodland areas in the Northern Hemisphere, may be grown from seed. The seed must be kept in the dark until the seedlings sprout (according to the directions on the seed package). My daughter who is ten, made the strawberry project her own. She propelled herself into this, dreaming not of lush berry plants with nodding flowers composed of delicate white petals and smiling yellow centers but of things further down the road. Strawberries and vanilla ice cream, strawberry shortcake, strawberry pie and even strawberries right off the plant\u2026 without the cream and sugar. The seedlings came up surprisingly fast, if these were the right seedlings, I wasn\u2019t sure, this was my first time growing these seeds. I peered at them and wondered if the bed had been \u201ccontaminated\u201d with other seeds, weed seeds? They sat there in the flat, petite and undemanding. Not looking for transplant, not really caring about much except being a stem with a teeny tiny leaf or two. Carefully picked apart and inserted into pencil size holes they were swallowed up by the soil. Still, they sat idle as another month went by. This was late April and every time we got a downpour I wondered if this was the rainstorm that would wash them away. While nothing was happening on the surface, much must have been taking place underground. The roots were winding their way about the soil seeking moisture and nutrients. Once the weather got consistently warmer additional tiny leaves appeared. My daughter\u2019s faith in these baby berry plants never wavered. She talked to, and tended her little plants several times a week, weeding and watering with true focus and commitment. By May, the plants were sending up sprigs that would fan out into cute saw-toothed leaves. With patience she waited until the next day to pick the berry, knowing that flavor comes with peak ripeness. That next evening, she headed out to the raised beds to pick her first strawberry of the season. Unfortunately, something else had gotten there first. The tiny fruit was gone, chewed off of the stem, red bits still attached to its green base, leaving little doubt about what had happened. My daughter has been by my side gardening with me since she was a toddler. She knows the ups and downs of planting a crop. She still has plenty of faith in her little strawberry plants.

The best location for impatiens is a partially sunny area, but avoid planting them directly under trees. Large tree roots often compete with other plants' roots for nutrients and soil moisture, and impatiens do not thrive in those hostile conditions. Additionally, ensure that the filtered sunlight does not turn into full shade. Prior to transplanting them, mix organic matter, such as compost, with the well-drained topsoil where you want to plant the seedlings. During transplanting, choose spacing wisely so that your impatiens grow low or tall. For example, a 10-inch spacing between plants forces them to spread horizontally as ground cover because the gaps are so large. Impatiens seedlings need to be acclimated to the outdoors before they are transplanted to an outdoor garden. In general, the acclimation process requires placing the plants in an outdoor sheltered area repeatedly for progressively longer time spans. This acclimation process prevents shock to the seedlings. Plant the impatiens in your garden during spring when frost is no longer a threat. In general, impatiens need a deep watering once each week during the growing season to encourage root spread and blossom development. If impatiens create fruits after pollination, the fruits eventually explode from internal pressure and disperse their seeds. The dustlike seeds tend to float in the air and away from the immediate area so that the mother plants do not have excessive competition from the offspring. As a result, your garden will not be overrun with new impatiens plants from seeds. Because the seeds are so small, it is best to plant only nursery-bred seedlings so that you do not struggle with trying to cultivate tiny seeds that may not germinate.

It was a fun experiment, and I learned a ton about growing spider plants from seed. The tiny little white spider plant flowers are insignificant and, when left unpollinated, they will just drop from the plant. BUT, when spider plant flowers are pollinated\u2026 Yep, you guessed it, they will produce seeds! In order for a spider plant to produce seeds, the flowers must be pollinated. You can do this yourself, or put your spider plant outside and let the bees do the work for you. To pollinate spider plants yourself, simply take your finger or a cotton swab and gently rub the inside of a flower. Then use the same finger/swab to go from flower to flower, gently rubbing the inside of each one to spread the pollen around. If pollination is successful, then once the flowers dry up and fall off, a bunch of green spider plant seed pods will be left behind. Spider plant seeds are the size and shape of garden pepper seeds. To make it easier to collect spider plant seeds, put the plant in a place where the seeds won\u2019t get lost once they start to fall out of the seed pods. You could also clip or pinch off the spider plant seed pods as they start to split open, and drop them into a paper bag or container. Then shake the container, or gently pinch the seed pods to collect the seeds. Once you collect the seeds, they are ready to plant right away, or you can store the seeds for a short time and plant them later. Plant the seeds as you would any other seed, in a loose seed starting soil mix. So, for spider plant seeds, plant them about a 1/4\u2033 \u2013 1/2\u2033 deep, then cover them with dirt. To help the seeds grow faster, put the seedling tray on a heating mat or over a heat vent (putting seedling trays over a heat vent will make them dry out faster though). In a couple of weeks, you should start to see tiny spider plant seedlings starting to emerge from the soil. As your spider plant seedlings start to grow a few leaves, you can begin to fertilize them. You can continue to use the same fertilizer throughout the life of your spider plants (only fertilize houseplants during the spring and summer months though). My experiment with starting spider plant seeds was a great success. In this experiment, I planted six seeds, and five of them germinated and grew into cute little spider plants. A few of the variegated spider plant seedlings even kept their variegation, which I\u2019m thrilled about. Enroll in the course and get started today! Great post. I was given a very small spider plant last year and am hoping that it will set seeds this year so I can see if your experiment works for me too. Cool, thanks for the excellent tips! Store them in a cool dry place. I wouldn\u2019t keep them stored for more than 4-5 months, at the longest. Here\u2019s more details about how I store my seeds\u2026 Storing Seeds Spider plant seedlings are just as easy to grow through the winter as the mother plant is though, so even if you plant the seeds in the fall, you can grow the seedlings as you would any spider plant houseplant. I leave it out in the summer, & it is so happy & healthy, & very very full. I didn\u2019t realize what they were at first, & I was just throwing them away, but after I read the above information I was very excited so I planted all of the spider plant seeds in a small pot.

There is also quite a list of common names: Coleus, Flame Nettle, Painted Nettle, Painted Leaf, and Poor Man\u2019s Croton. The name was probably given due to the fact that the stamens, the male portions of the Coleus flowers, are fused into a tube or sheath. Coleuses are members of the mint family, Lamiaceae. They have the distinctive stems that are square in cross section and are closely related to peppermint, spearmint, salvia, basil, thyme and oregano. Coleus plants are herbaceous perennials in their native habitat, and that could have originally been Africa to Asia and the Pacific Islands. Well, it has the most incredible foliage with colors and color combinations that no other plant species can offer. The colors are brilliant and the range in shades is limitless: dark mahogany, browns, greens, yellows, bronze, reds, and oranges. The shapes of the leaves are lovely as well with some being lobed and frilly. The Coleus plants have different growth habits; some are tall and lanky, some branch freely and are compact, and others trail and are beautiful in hanging baskets. Also, if there is a need for shade plants, Coleus is perfect for areas with limited sun. Using starter trays or pots and pre-moistened sterile potting mix, the seeds should be placed on the surface and gently pressed into the soil. Covering the pots with glass or clear plastic helps to keep the moisture in the seeds. Keep a room temperature of 70\u00b0 and place the tray or pots in a sunny location, preferably with indirect light as to not dry out the seeds. Remove the covering once germination has started and set the tray in a window where the seedlings will receive 6 hours of sun.

He had been watching her with the eyes of someone who loved her, and she had been watching him as well as the person she loved. She did not entirely hate him. Sin made her dance slow and easy, her fingers touching the air as if it was water that would ripple at her touch, as if she could make every move, every slow wind of her hips and swing, a caress. She thought about the way Alan held back from touching Nick but held close, the way Mae had come to sit across a room from him and Jamie could laugh at him. She thought of how humans could bend and make room for a demon, learn to welcome a demon in out of the cold. She lifted her hands as if to touch, as if to open a door, and then drew them back. She danced along chalk lines with her enemies outside the door, in glass-torn jeans and a blood-streaked shirt, and she was absolutely certain that nobody could resist drawing near to watch her.

The yellow light in the cracked green window flickered and then by degrees began to grow dim, throwing the thing that sat on the warped porch into shadow. Nesta scooped the bundle from the wet porch and hustled it inside. She kicked the old door shut behind her and hopped from her left foot to her right as she approached the long table. \"Here, here, and there, bring it here.\" \"Here and there. Here. There.\" Nesta giggled and Chanarasanda blew on the lamp, giving air to the starved flame. It grew, a long yellow tongue to lick the glass which contained it. Miluchra peered over the table's edge, ruby eyes reflecting the flame she'd brought. She rubbed hands together and small sparks shot between her blackened palms. She, too, reached for Nesta's bundle, but Nesta handed it only to Guinhumara, who placed it in the barrel of still water on the table. The four women watched the bundle sink through the water with a gurgle. The bundle absorbed the liquid and sank fast. Bubbles rose in a shimmer, popped on the surface with air kisses.

You, Chanarasanda, blow till the foul thing takes flight.\" Chanarasanda ceased her blowing and the grains dusted gently over the surface of the water. One bubble emerged from the bundle within, breaking with a peacock's mating cry and the smell of fire. \"Such a stink, sweet stink,\" Nesta whispered and patted the smooth black fall of Miluchra's hair. Nesta pulled a pink flower from her headdress. Above the barrel of water, she rubbed the flower between her fingers till pollen scattered the water's surface, till the petals bent under the pressure and yielded a pink rain that smelled of apples. Nesta dropped the remains of the petals into the water and Guinhumara stirred the mass with her fingers. \"It grows,\" Chanarasanda said and beneath the water, the thing stirred. The wrappings, like fallen sails, moved in the water; a body, a hand, toes, briefly visible under the wet fabric. A great belch rose from the barrel and water scattered over the four women. Guinhumara closed her eyes and sucked the water through her skin. Nesta lifted her arms and drank the rivulets of water, while the wetness was blown from Chanarasanda as if by a hard spring wind. They joined hands around the barrel, bare feet placed flat against the rough wood floor. They encircled the table, round around square, and with fingers entwined, attended the thing in the barrel. It rolled in the water, splashed, and bellowed until another bubble rose and broke. The thing in the barrel snatched a hand out, grabbed the ribbons on the edge of Guinhumara's crescent hat, and pulled it off. The hat vanished into the tub with a gurgle, Guinhumara's bald head reflected as the water stilled. They all looked at Miluchra, the quiet one who now spoke.

On the heels of her question, the thing emerged from the water, pearl-white fingers gripping the edge of the barrel. The wet wrappings clung to its round head, turned the room dark, and made it blind. It slipped in the water, arrived with a landed-fish splat on the flat table. The four women leaned closer and Guinhumara plucked the wrappings off the wriggling creature. \"We did not make this,\" Chanarasanda said, pressing a finger into the dough-soft belly.

She will study the highest-risk subtype of medulloblastoma, with the goal of understanding the possible role of translational control in this cancer. She will test both novel and existing mTOR inhibitors as a potential therapeutic strategy for patients. Project title: \"Understanding the role of translational control in humanized mouse models for medulloblastoma\"\nLeptomeningeal metastasis, or spread of cancer cells into the spinal fluid, is a devastating complication of cancer resulting in rapid neurologic disability and death. This approach will be coupled with hypothesis-driven mouse models to assemble coherent molecular mechanisms that describe cancer cell interactions with their microenvironment. This mechanistic work will suggest new targets for therapeutic intervention, paving the way for novel treatment approaches. Dr. Boire works under the mentorship of Joan Massagu\u00e9, PhD, at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York. Project title: \"Molecular determinants of leptomeningeal metastasis: a translational approach\"\nBrain metastases are the most common tumor in the brain, most frequently originating from melanoma and carcinomas of the lung and breast. Unfortunately, treatment options are limited, and most current clinical trials in the US exclude patients with brain metastases. Dr. Brastianos recently completed a large study to understand the genetic changes that occur in brain metastases. She identified genetic alterations in brain metastases that predict sensitivity to targeted therapies. As most genomically guided trials in cancer have excluded patients with active brain metastases, this represents a potential paradigm shift in the management of patients with brain metastases. Project title: \"Investigation of novel targeted therapeutic approaches for brain metastases\"\nDr. Chang is investigating the role of activity-regulated gene expression in human brain evolution. These pathways are broadly conserved across all mammals, but newer studies have identified features that are unique to primates and may influence important aspects of brain function and tumor progression. Dr. Chang will study the function, regulation, and evolution of primate-specific genes. Through these experiments, she aims to uncover molecular insight into what makes humans susceptible to cancer. Project title: \"The role of activity-regulated gene expression in human brain evolution\"\nGlioblastoma remains the most aggressive brain tumor diagnosed in patients, and it is clear that new treatment strategies are needed. There is significant optimism around the use of approaches that stimulate a patient's immune system to treat brain tumors. Gavin focuses on identifying the specific components of a patient's brain tumor that the immune system recognizes and determining whether there are regional differences in this immune recognition. He hopes that this work will increase our understanding of how the immune system recognizes brain cancers and will increase our understanding of how to rationally design personalized vaccines to treat these tumors. Project title: \"Characterizing the immunogenic landscape of glioblastoma\"\nDr. Maus is engineering the body's own immune T cells to fight deadly brain tumors like glioblastoma. The engineered CAR T cells are designed to target cells displaying multiple abnormal proteins (antigens) made from cancer-causing oncogenes; theywill act as drug carriers to address the specific hurdles of antigen heterogeneity and penetrating the blood brain barrier. She is testing these \"living drugs\" in vitro and in mouse models with the goal of ultimately advancing these studies to human clinical trials. Furthermore, if this system works for brain tumors, it has the potential to be applied as a therapy for other forms of cancer as well. Project title: \"Next-generation CAR T cells for EGFRvIII-positive glioblastoma\"\nDr. O'Brown is investigating the molecular mechanisms that govern the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which acts as the gatekeeper for the brain. While the BBB protects the brain from pathogens and provides the necessary environment for normal brain function, the BBB also acts as an obstacle to drug delivery for the treatment of neurological diseases, including brain tumors. By investigating the cellular signals that induce or remove barrier properties, she hopes to identify ways by which she can selectively manipulate the barrier to allow for drug delivery to the brain. Project title: \"Molecular and cellular mechanisms of transcytosis regulation in blood-brain barrier function\"\nDr. Pfau aims to identify the molecular regulators of blood-brain barrier heterogeneity. Consequently, the BBB renders many cancer therapeutics ineffective for treatment of primary and metastatic brain tumors, as drugs that effectively treat cancer in the rest of the body cannot efficiently enter the brain. She seeks to better understand how the BBB functions by characterizing the \u201cwindows of the brain,\u201d regions where the barrier is naturally more open to allow communication between the brain and the rest of the body through the bloodstream. In determining how the BBB is altered in these regions, she anticipates that her work will identify key molecular regulators that the brain naturally uses to open the blood-brain barrier and thus provide insight into how it can be modulated to promote drug delivery to tumors in the brain. Project title: \"Investigating the molecular determinants of blood-brain barrier heterogeneity\"\nDr. Sarthy is developing new easy-to-use and affordable methods for studying DNA packaging and epigenetics (modification of gene expression) in pediatric cancers with a special focus on diffuse midline gliomas and neuroblastoma. These methods may help explain the drivers of pediatric malignancies and allow clinicians to better monitor response to treatment with the goal of developing new drugs that restore the cell\u2019s ability to package DNA correctly. Dr. Taylor is investigating the impact of neural activity on pediatric high-grade glioma (pHGG) invasion. The innate ability of pHGGs to diffusely infiltrate healthy brain tissue is a classical hallmark of the disease, which represents a major contributor to the devastating prognosis. Using optogenetic techniques to stimulate neuronal activity, she will directly and noninvasively test the effect of activity-dependent secreted proteins on tumor cell invasion in human cancer cells and animal models. She plans to confirm the pro-infiltrative effect of candidate proteins on pHGG and subsequently uncover the mechanisms by which they alter the molecular dynamics of the tumor cell. Her hope is to highlight a novel means by which the neural microenvironment drives glioma progression and most importantly identify a new set of therapeutic targets to limit glioma spread.

Keith Stewart, M.B., Ch.B., in his opening remarks at the sixth Individualizing Medicine 2017: Advancing Care Through Genomics, a conference hosted by the Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine. The test is already making a difference for patients, revealing genetic mutations that offer patients new options with targeted treatments. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) tests that identify pieces of DNA shed into the bloodstream by cancerous tumors are offering the hope of tracking cancer as early as possible \u2500 when it is most treatable. Mayo Clinic researchers and clinicians are working collaboratively to develop blood tests ranging from those that detect single changes (mutations) in single genes to those that look for thousands of mutations in hundreds of genes. The first test launched in the clinical lab detects a specific change in the BRAFgene, primarily linked to melanoma. Genomic testing has revealed a diagnosis in approximately 30 percent of patients, all who had been unable to find a diagnosis with traditional clinical testing. With specialized genomics clinics for many gastrointestinal diseases, multidisciplinary teams of clinicians and researchers are using genetic testing to find a cause and then develop personalized care plans for many conditions. With more than 1.5 million adverse drug events each year as a result of medications, Dr. Stewart emphasized the importance of selecting the right medication for each patient to maximize the treatment benefit and avoid harmful side effects. Pharmacogenomics uses DNA tests to help clinicians select medications that will reduce the risk of adverse side effects and increase efficacy for patients\u2014based on their genetic makeup. Over the past year, Mayo Clinic has led efforts to apply pharmacogenomics testing proactively to improve patient care broadly and in many subspecialties, such as pediatric gastrointestinal disorders, liver disease and neurosurgery. Illustrating the benefit of pharmacogenomics testing, Dr. Stewart pointed to his own experience having his genome sequenced which revealed new information about his sensitivity to certain medications. Whole-genome sequencing looks at a patient\u2019s entire genetic makeup for information on inherited conditions, genetic variants that drive cancer, and links to disease. Dr. Stewart emphasized how genomic sequencing could help physicians be proactive in screening for and treating many conditions. For example, many inherited cancers are missed with traditional clinical testing. David Ledbetter, Ph.D., executive vice president and chief scientific officer, Geisinger Health System, echoed Dr. Stewart\u2019s emphasis on the value of preemptive genomic sequencing. Dr. Ledbetter leads Geisinger\u2019s MyCode Community Health Initiative, an innovative research effort that has already revealed lifesaving information for participants. More than 160,000 participants are already enrolled, more than half way to program\u2019s goal of 250,000 participants. According to Dr. Ledbetter, the program has already saved the life of a 57 year old grandmother and MyCode participant. Because the cancer was caught early, Barnes\u2019 cancer can be successfully treated. As Dr. Ledbetter pointed out, since Barnes\u2019 did not have a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, she never would have suspected that she was at risk for either type of cancer.", "hit_ratio": 0.7068965517241379}, {"doc_text": "In the two-room suite of Bart and Geraldine\u2019s office, the first three Teka siblings sat in companionable silence. Bart sat behind the executive desk, Abe on the opposite chair, and Clement perched on the window sill; all three wearing pensive expressions. Being a dad of four impressionable children meant he had to employ milder terms in expressing his irritation. Abe remained silent. The only way any of his family members could tell was by the pain in his eyes. Though this time, he kept his head bent, still reeling from the letter he\u2019d found in Eleazar\u2019s room hours ago. Out of the three, Clement had been through the horrible foster system and bore deep scars from it. Bart and Clement looked up at the sound of Abe\u2019s voice. \u201cSo it is a tracker,\u201d Clement muttered, shaking his head. Their eyes widened. \u201cWhat for now?\u201d Clement asked, articulating their unease. They all remembered the times Phoebe had been rushed to emergency, only to miscarry the babies she\u2019d carried. The thought of Darah facing the same fate, propelled Abe and Clement for the door, almost tripping over each other to exit the office suite. He didn\u2019t dare ask what happened, the look in her eyes revealed all and chilled him to the bone. \u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s go!\u201d Abe barked from the driver\u2019s seat. L.J. stirred awake, the sound of the beeping EKG greeting him in an empty room. He groaned and closed his eyes, groggy but without the searing pain. Thank God. Now if someone could do something about the cumbersome mask around his mouth. He reached for it just as the door swung open. He frowned in disapproval, watching her pour out a cup of coffee. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll brew you your favorite once we get out of here\u2026\u201d she took a sip and faked a grimace, though a telltale dimple in her right cheek gave her away. L.J. sighed forlornly. What a nice girl\u2026 if only J.R. would change his mind. The mention of his son had him scanning the room. The wrinkle between her brow and the conflict in her eyes made the hair on his forearms stand up. L.J. had a sinking feeling he wouldn\u2019t like what she was about to tell him. J.R. couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off her. He gazed at the curtain of thick lashes laid flat, her parched lips parted in sleep, tendrils of dark curly hair laying against her pixyish face. His fingers itched to touch her, to hover over the rounded tip of her nose and feel her breathing. Cold frisson rushed through him, sending tremors along his back as it had when Phoebe finally called him back with the dreadful news. He\u2019d been allowed entry to the room only because the staff believed he was her fianc\u00e9. J.R. closed his eyes tight, scolding himself. He should\u2019ve proposed sooner and made her happy with his love. Why did he waste so much time until it was too late. He could\u2019ve lost them both. The thought made his eyes water. His foolish reaction of Darah\u2019s first child not being his and his begrudging the baby\u2019s father for causing a lifetime of drama had caused this fiasco. \u201cIt\u2019s about time\u2014\u201d the rest of her words were muffled in Abe\u2019s chest as he pulled her to him and held her tight. \u201cIs she alright?\u201d Bart asked, standing by J.R.\u2019s shoulder. \u201cShe\u2019s asleep,\u201d J.R. answered listlessly, returning his eyes to her. How he wished she would open those pretty eyes of hers and melt away the fear that gripped his heart. Guilt pricked J.R., as he recalled the night Darah slept on the stiff-backed sofa in his father\u2019s room. Clement took the seat Phoebe abandoned for her husband\u2019s arms, and reached for Darah\u2019s hand. \u201cIt better not,\u201d Clement muttered, squeezing her hand before releasing it. J.R. swallowed hard as relief swept over him like a rushing wave, stealing his breath and his words. He\u2019d almost lost her, all because of his foolhardiness. The brothers didn\u2019t say a word, didn\u2019t move a step. Phoebe glanced from Darah to J.R. whose gazes were locked with such intensity, and stood to her feet. \u201cSure, we can do that. C\u2019mon, boys.\u201d She patted Clement\u2019s shoulder, hooked an arm under Bart\u2019s and Abe\u2019s, and tugged them towards the door. Her gently-spoken words unlocked something in him and he reached for her hand, cradling it between his. \u201cAnything.\u201d In fact, he was willing to die for her if the need presented itself\u2013his love for her was that strong, that overwhelming. \u201cYou\u2019re certainly are an odd one.\u201d L.J. coughed and drew in a raspy breath, his brow furrowed in pain. Relief loosened her shoulders when his lips twitched a smile. Maybe J.R.\u2019s father could be charmed after all. Darah hurried to his side and ignoring the weight of his suspicious stare on her face, she fluffed his pillow before returning it behind his head. Darah nodded, knowing the gist of it all. \u201cI guess I\u2019d forgotten life can be unjust at time\u2014\u201d L.J. drew in an uneven breath that caught in his throat. His brows furrowed and alarm flitted in his features as he choked on the breath. The sound of the cough that left his mouth was violent and harsh, the sheer pain of it deepened the lines in his brow. \u201cI-I\u2019ll get the nurse.\u201d She hurried out the door before he could stop her, not that she noticed as she barreled down the hallway. The woman\u2019s amusement fled as her eyes drifted over Darah\u2019s head. She brushed past Darah toward the room, and Darah didn\u2019t follow, hurrying around the corner in search of J.R. and Hana. \u201cWhat will he say once he finds out?\u201d Hana stifled Darah\u2019s words. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d J.R. answered in a strained voice. Darah\u2019s stomach turned violently and she shifted from view when Hana turned her head to glare at J.R. Curiosity of J.R.\u2019s thoughts temporarily outweighed Darah\u2019s urgency to inform him of his father. So she stalled, waiting and dreading his response. Darah\u2019s brow furrowed. What didn\u2019t he know? J.R. was silent a little too long and Darah bit the inside of her cheek a little too hard, drawing blood. Her pulse thumped violently in her throat as she stared at his back and broad shoulders. The woman was meddling more now than before she knew Darah\u2019s little secret. Darah frowned at the back of J.R.\u2019s head. With each second J.R. remained silent, Darah grew more troubled. Blood pooled in her mouth as she gnawed the inside of her cheek, eyes stinging with tears that threatened to spill, her stomach in gnarled knots. She could imagine the horror and disappointment in L.J.\u2019s eyes, and the hurt and shame in J.R.\u2019s. Darah took a step back, losing courage to announce herself. She was the bad guy in the story\u2014the villain dashing L.J.\u2019s dreams of beholding his grandchildren and seeing his bloodline through his only son. And every time J.R. would gaze at her son, he\u2019d feel cheated and resentful. The thought of J.R. resenting her hurt more than the pesky ache in her stomach. They didn\u2019t need to know she\u2019d come for them, and Nurse Karen was more than capable of stabilizing J.R.\u2019s father. Suddenly Clement opened the door leading to the garden and stepped inside, greeting the couple with a smile. When he spotted Darah standing by the column, he started to call out to her. Noticing Clement\u2019s furrowed brow, J.R. turned in the direction of his gaze. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d J.R. inquired gently. Darah released the breath she didn\u2019t know she\u2019d been holding, and a solid tear slid down her cheek. Thought you\u2019d be heading back.\u201d Clement asked. Wiping the tears with the back of her hand, Darah slunk away before Clement\u2019s could respond. She\u2019d make her decision now. J.R. didn\u2019t deserve to bear the shame and pain of what she\u2019d done. Deciding to keep his opinion about that decision unspoken, J.R. simply nodded. His frown only deepened as she confirmed his concern for Darah. I better get my pregnant sister home then.\u201d Cutting J.R. a withering glance, Clement brushed past them to go after Darah. The three found Darah standing outside the door to L.J.\u2019s room. Clement swallowed a sigh and wrapped his arms around her. J.R. nodded listlessly and lowered to the chair beside his father\u2019s bed, staring at his mask-covered face. \u201cThank you for catching it on time,\u201d Hana said, her hand still resting on J.R.\u2019s shoulder. J.R. looked up, surmising why Darah trembled in his arms. Maybe it was best for Darah to return with Clement than staying here with him. As much as he needed her now, she was better off at home with her family. Resolved, he turned to Hana. Without another word, Clement disconnected the call and J.R. lowered the phone to his thigh. Part of him was relieved, part of him disappointed with the news. Deciding to worry about Darah later, he shook out of it to ask Nurse Karen the next steps in his father\u2019s recovery. More than anything, she dreaded and resented the resolution altogether.

It is the catalyst for bringing a family spanning generations and continents back together over 50 years later, when almost 100 years of memory and moments will again become distilled in a moment in time, captured by newer technology, yet essentially the same. Standing in this photograph, smiling back at you is a family all born from the five children of Manuel (Mendy) and Sophie Amdur, who immigrated to South Africa from England in 1947. Their sister, Anne, and their brother, Albert, are sadly no longer alive, and with Albert, the family name Amdur died too \u2013 as he had three daughters and no sons. But, the Amdur legacy depicted in this original photo lives on despite name changes and oceans separating them, and they will reunite to catch up on each other\u2019s lives at a family reunion, but one with a difference. The idea for this reunion came from Brenda Mitchel, the daughter of Anne who lives in Australia, when she was visiting her cousin Steve Katznelson, Rita\u2019s son, in the United States. They were looking at family photos, reminiscing about the \u2018good old days\u2019, when they came across a photograph of the entire family (bar one cousin, who had not yet been born). The whole Amdur family had come together in 1966 from Canada, Rhodesia, and Johannesburg to take part in Lily Mark\u2019s son Heath\u2019s bar mitzvah (the brother of Sheena Wolovitz, who is the South African arm of the reunion). \u201cToday, there are family members living in Australia, Israel, England, and America,\u201d says Lily. \u201cOur older nephews and nieces were either born here in South Africa or in Zimbabwe, in what was then called Rhodesia.\u201d \u201cThe emigration of so many of our family members over the years has always saddened me. Modern technology makes distance so much easier and more bearable. With the advent of email and Skype, and, more recently, the incredible Whatsapp, distance virtually melts away,\u201d says Sheena. But, continual effort is required to keep up the relationships, and, even then, it isn\u2019t always easy despite the easy access. Over the last 50 years, some of the cousins have never even met. \u201cOur mother had two brothers in America, and she could only write to them using snail mail, letters written mainly in Yiddish that would take weeks to arrive. Because of the distance separating us, we never met their families.\u201d Rita, however, because she lives in America, is now in touch with some of these American cousins, and Lily has had some contact via email. There were some spouses and children present who had never met before. Some cousins had not seen each other for more than 50 years and have previously had very little contact with each other. And, everyone would have the chance to connect, and reconnect. They should share in each other\u2019s simchas, joy, as well as being supports for the difficult times in life,\u201d says Sheena. \u201cThis reunion brings us back \u2018home\u2019 for such a long overdue special gathering; what a great opportunity to unite, share stories, introduce our nuclear families to the clan, and create new memories \u2013 it will remain in Amdur lore for generations to come,\u201d says Steve. \u201cFamily is a value instilled in us all by our parents as they were very close, and I too have great memories of my cousins throughout the years. The first to take place on the Thursday evening, when everyone has arrived, a relaxed meet and greet dinner at Sheena\u2019s home in Glenhazel, followed by a traditional Friday night Shabbos dinner and a relaxed get-together on Saturday night. The fourth will be the raison de\u2019\u00eatre: a brunch at Sheena which would culminate with\u2026 THE FAMILY PHOTO. Everyone envisioned the day with excitement and energy, the joy of recognising and acknowledging a shared heritage, as well as commitments to closer contact and more communication in the future. It would be another footprint in time, spanning the decades between the Amdurs of the past, the ones in the original photo, the family members who made it to the reunion, and those who might recreate it again in a photo from the future, sometime down the line when the Amdur family meet again. Until then, it\u2019s email and Whatsapp, with a face and a friend to put to a name, and a living memory of what has become the Amdur legacy to which these people all belong.", "hit_ratio": 0.8362068965517241}, {"doc_text": "They died 3 weeks apart, separately, in two completely unrelated tragedies.

The basic situation I have known as a child was that of incessant mental and physical humiliation and a fear I might be killed at any moment. But the direct physical threat of being killed did not come from my parents. My brother has treated both me and my sister sadistically, as a response to the mental cruelty which we all suffered from my mother.

Before one tries to dismiss the film because of the non-traditional horror approach, understand the genre itself often crossovers between suspense and drama, these aspects help create tension and set the tone, but the viewer needs to understand that a few clich\u00e9s do occur but the story stands well itself. Young Catherine Caldwell\u2019s (Lilja Johnson) childhood plagued hideous problems leaving her with so many emotional scars, which could challenge Dr. Phil, she witnesses much turmoil and heartache along with apparition torment. The movie transitions to present day with Catherine (Keeley Hazell) and her husband Harvey (Craig Rees) trying regain their love for each other after the death of their daughter Lilly (Leyla Gellan) died. Meanwhile, Hazell portrays a grieving mother full of emotional conflicts grasping at the final straw of reality, while Rees might be perceived as standoffish, more likely unsure of what to do, how to mourn and yet stay strong and positive for his wife. Sutton who penned the script gives the two primary actors a positive foundation to build from, and conveys to the audience the pain and suffering of losing one\u2019s child, a tough and likely inconceivable an action no parent wants to visit upon them or truly anyone. The ghostly apparition also plays more than the standard bump in the night, or exaggerated manifestation of itself, rather appearing in surfaces that can cast a reflection to objects moving. One must look for three horror cameos from Actress Lynn Lowry as Elizabeth Connelly, a very emotionally withdrawn woman, along with Elissa Dowling as The Doll and Elieen Dietz, whom many recall as a demon in The Exorcist (1973) stars only in the trailer, her main scenes sadly cut from the film. \u2018Whispers\u2019 itself generates a solid finale, bundling all of the anguish, spiritual scars and emotional pain laced over a supernatural tale. As with many low budget films, the cracks show through a little bit, but Sutton works with some very good camerawork, to overlap these issues concerning the sound. The sound suffers tremendously and tests the audience patience, in the first act, and seems smoother through the rest of the movie as well as the CGI; it feels disjointed never quite blending throughout the movie. If you saw the film entitled Conjurer (2008) from director Clint Hutchison one might notice similar story links of a couple moving to the countryside for an escape of the child\u2019s death, however it this storyline often used in horror movies, but this time executed fairly well.

On his right were two rows of chairs on which were seated twelve men, also in white and gold robes and a white light seemed to be radiating from them as though the room were being lighted by some indirect method.

The room above seemed to be well lighted and if one listened closele he could here soft music coming as it seemed from somewhere above. The door on the left also opened to a stairway but this stairway went down and at the bottom was an open door leading into a room from which no light came. Immediately to the right and in front of the ancient judge was a seat. The people in the line were taking their turns at this seat. After a few questions were asked by the old man and replys given by the person in the seat, a consultation would take place among the men clothed in gold and white robes. Then the old man would indicate one of the doors at the rear of the room and the person in the seat would enter the door which was indicated to him. Occasionally when he would indicate one of the doors for the person seated before him, there would be a rumbling like the sound of thunder overhead, whereupon the discussion would be resumed at the end of which the old man would indicate the other door.

Last year we finally gave in and made four raised beds for our small fruits (raspberries, blueberries, strawberries), which makes perfect sense. Raised beds mean the soil drains better, warms up sooner in the season, and the beds can be netted against deer as well as meshed on the bottom against voles.

In a paper published in the journal PNAS in February, the authors demonstrate through a series of ingenious experiments that smell can be sensitive enough to pick up on tiny differences in atomic vibrations. The conventional theory of smell works somewhat like a lock and a key. The molecules are the key, and they \u2018lock in\u2019 to receptors that fit their exact shape and size. This is the shape theory of smell, and the basic idea had been suggested in the 1st century BCE by the Epicurean philosopher Lucretius. The idea has since garnered substantial evidence with the discovery of odor receptors, leading to the 2004 Nobel Prize in Medicine for working out the overall picture of how smell works. These bonds are somewhat elastic, causing the atoms in the molecules to constantly jiggle about. But the analogy breaks down at this microscopic scale, and one needs to resort to the laws of quantum mechanics to understand what is happening. It turns out that, similar to the balls and springs, molecules have certain ways in which they prefer to jiggle. They can stretch, rock, wag and twist around. This is exactly what the experimenters did, by taking a molecule, and replacing some of its hydrogen atoms with deuterium. Deuterium is a sort of heavier sibling of hydrogen that behaves very similarly, but is about twice as heavy. And a heavy atom is harder to wiggle - so the molecule and its counterpart will now vibrate at different rates, but their shape and size will remain the same. In the first experiment, the authors presented the flies with acetophenone at one exit. Acetophenone is a colorless sweet smelling liquid with a fairly simple molecular structure. If the ability to smell relies only on the shape of the molecule, and not on the vibrations, then one would expect nothing to change. In figure A, the bars show the percentage of flies that chose that chose one exit over the other. The flies were initially attracted to the acetophenone (ACP). However, as the researchers replaced more and more of the hydrogen atoms with deuterium in this molecule (3, 5 or all 8 hydrogen atoms), they found that the instead of being attracted by the scent, the flies were repelled by it. If the flies were presented with acetophenone at one exit, and its heavier counterpart on the other, they strongly preferred the former scent (first bar in figure B). The set up is the same as before, acetophenone on one side, and the heavy version on the other. But now, they zapped the flies with an electric shock whenever they made a particular choice - say, for choosing the heavy molecule. In this way, they could condition the flies to reliably prefer either of the two compounds. The flies could apply their lessons from one scent to the other. When zapped on regular ACP, they avoided regular BZA, and went zapped on heavy ACP, they avoided heavy BZA. (The experiments were repeated across 3 pairs of molecules to ensure robustness). Since these chemicals are synthesized in entirely different ways, this means that it\u2019s not the impurities, but that the flies can somehow sniff out the \u2018deuterium-ness\u2019 of a molecule. In other words, could the deuterium be causing some subtle non-vibrational change in the chemistry that the flies can detect? The flies had no preference for either chemical in the pair. Based on their theory - that it is the vibrations, not the presence of deuterium, that is being used by the flies to discern smells - the authors made the following prediction. So the odor receptors of flies are essentially incorporating a biological version of a spectrograph - an instrument that can tune in to vibrations at different frequencies. A working model of this \u2018tuning in\u2019 might work was first proposed in 1996 by Luca Turin, one of the authors of the current paper. First, it\u2019s science at it\u2019s best - the authors address a fascinating and fundamental question through clear, cleverly designed and simple to understand experiments.

In the eyes of Yu Yu and the other three powerful beings, these traceless sky devils were evil things that could bring a disaster to this world. But to Ji Hao, these sky devils were incomparably precious treasures that could allow him to reach to a supremely high level, even climb to the top. Yu Yu\u2019s spirit treasure was a sword. Without a doubt, he was a powerful sword artist. Ji Hao fortunately learned this set of sword moves from Yu Yu, and if he could truly find a nice sword, his power would be improved even further.

According to Charles II, his sister was \u201cby no means upset over the prospect.\u201d She was sixteen, he was twenty. A own household, a own fortune, sister-in-law to the King, not having to leave France\u2026. He was eager to establish a own household, where his brother had nothing to say, and to get hold of his appanage. It were the properties, parts of them, that his uncle Gaston de France had possessed and which reverted to the crown after his death. What enchanted him in the moment and made him court Minette, might have been the prospect of a little freedom to be gained\u2026 and this freedom could not come too fast. On March 31 in 1661, three years after Monsieur had uttered a desire to wed, the great day finally arrived. It was by far not as glorious as Monsieur had wished for, since the court was in high mourning. Minette had been ill and had also to recover from the death of two of her siblings, Mary, Princess Royal, and Henry, Duke of Gloucester. On March 30, both made their confessions and witnessed how their marriage contract was signed by Louis XIV, Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se d\u2019Autriche and Henriette Marie de France. On March 31, around noon, both were married in the chapel of Henriette Marie de France in the Palais Royal. Present were their immediate family, la Grande Mademoiselle, the Prince de Cond\u00e9 and a small group of representatives. It was that time of the month and Philippe not pleased at all. Nevertheless all seemed to go well for the first few weeks, until talk of Minette\u2019s flirtings reached his ears. From the very point on, both did their very best to make each others life as difficult as possible. Minette felt wronged by the flirting accusations, Philippe felt betrayed by his wife, his brother, and his lover. After the sudden demise of the first Madame, as the wife of Monsieur was traditionally called, a second Madame was needed. The very obvious choice for him was their cousin, the unmarried Anne-Marie Louise d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans, called la Grande Mademoiselle, but she was not happy about it at all. Talk of such a match already circulated before Monsieur married Minette and while la Grande Mademoiselle was not really opposed to it back in the days, she was now. Mademoiselle was in love, not with Monsieur, but with a certain Duc de Lauzun, who she intended to wed. She had no large dowry, was not really handsome, very German, but a descendant of Elizabeth Stuart and her father\u2019s territory, along the Rhine, might prove useful in the future. It did. Monsieur appeared not to be moved too much by the prospect of a second marriage, the public observed him showing normal behaviour. What might have cheered him, was the fact that this second marriage could be celebrated in style at least. \u00c9lisabeth-Charlotte, nicknamed Liselotte, converted from her Protestant faith to the Catholic and was wedded to Monsieur two days later, on November 6 in 1671, in the cath\u00e9drale de Metz. Monsieur and the new Madame did not meet until a few days later. He travelled all the way from Paris, in not much of a haste and stopping often to receive congratulations, to meet his new wife on a road leading from Tilloy-en-Bellay to Ch\u00e2lons. The new Madame was nineteen years old, not much of a looker and of a plump figure. In Ch\u00e2lons, the couple received the blessings, attended mass and witnessed a solemn Te Deum. Feasting and fireworks followed. The following day the couple left for Villers-Cotter\u00eats, the chateau to which Monsieur fled as the Chevalier de Lorraine had been arrested, and there the party continued. More feasting and fireworks, congratulations and salutes, but it was only the hors d\u2019oeuvre to what was to follow in Paris. The streets were crowded as the new Madame made her entrance into the city and she was thus introduced to every one of importance. Said male lovers were the reason in the end why the marriage became a little turbulent at times. All in all, it was still less troublesome, to Monsieur at least, then the first marriage. As the years passed by, both arranged themselves with the other and could laugh about the funny habits of the other. Liselotte outlived her husband and died in 1722 as the mother of the Regent of France.", "hit_ratio": 1.7767857142857142}, {"doc_text": "The Dreyfus Affair, as it came to be called, began in 1894, when the French military discovered that someone had been passing defence secrets to the Germans. Captain Alfred Dreyfus, a Jew, was arrested for the crime and sentenced to life imprisonment. Over the next few years, as the doubtful evidence was publicly reexamined, France become torn into two opposed and sometimes violent camps: 'Dreyfusards' who believed that he was innocent and had become a scapegoat because he was Jewish, and the frequently anti-Semitic 'anti-Dreyfusards', who refused to contenance any questioning of military justice. The affair was the biggest news story of its time, and, taking place at the same time as the cinema itself was born, it became one of the first major news events to be tackled by the infant film medium, though with varying degrees of accuracy. One filmic representation was outright deception, when Francis Doublier, touring the Jewish districts of Russia in the late 1890s, showed selected shots of buildings and scenery, while a lecturer mendaciously declared them as the very places where Dreyfus had been tried and imprisoned. This event, taking place in Rennes, became a great media circus, with scores of journalists and photographers descending on the town. In amongst them was a certain Monsieur Orde, carting a huge Biograph camera around the streets, and, despite the protests of the Dreyfus family, trying to record anything connected with the affair. He managed to film Madame Dreyfus on one of her visits to the prison and, by renting a house across from the prison yard and biding his time, succeeded in obtaining a shot of the prisoner himself on one of his daily walks. The next step in the screen portrayal of Dreyfus was dramatisation, and two film versions of the affair were made in 1899: Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s began work on his one in August, which consisted of some twelve separate scenes, showing Dreyfus (played by an ironworker) from his arrest, through his degradation and imprisonment, to the trial in Rennes. A Path\u00e9 version, in six scenes including the trial, was in production at about the same time, and both were on the market by the autumn of 1899. M\u00e9li\u00e8s was a passionate Dreyfusard, and his portrayal of the prisoner reflects the filmmaker's sympathies, though this was not to everyone's taste: the first screening provoked fighting between pro- and anti-Dreyfusards, and M\u00e9li\u00e8s' version was apparently banned by the French government, the first instance of film censorship for political reasons. A restriction on showing films about the Dreyfus affair was only lifted in 1950. The affair had clearly demonstrated, even in this very early period, that the cinema could tackle burning contemporary events in both factual and dramatised formats.", "hit_ratio": 0.9107142857142857}, {"doc_text": "Designed for top quality garden furniture brand Tribu by Ilia Eckardt each light has a removable cover made from knitted polyolefin rope which can be selected in five colours; white, linen, brick, moss or wenge.

But before all that, you\u2019ll surely notice the striking smell. The irresistible aroma of freshly ground coffee, the seductive scent of melting butter, the comforting whiff of toasting bread. And if you stop and listen to the chatter in the kitchen, you\u2019ll probably hear a bit of French too. It\u2019s not just the greeting of \u201cBonjour\u201d from behind the counter but it\u2019s the rapid conversations between Alison Barber, Kerian Jarry, and Sophie Clerico, the family team that owns the shop. While we\u2019re sure you\u2019ll be tempted by a pastry or two, the cannel\u00e9 and kougin-amman are must tries, this week\u2019s OTM item from Madame Monsieur is the mini truffle croque madame, a decadent french classic that won\u2019t disappoint. The sandwich is rich, with more than one layer of cheese, but don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s mini, so you\u2019ll have room for those desserts. To learn more about this adorable croque madame and about the madames and monsieur behind Madame Monsieur, we sat down with owner and chief creative officer, Kerian Jarry. But we\u2019ve been established for two years now, so we wanted to create a new concept of the croque madame and have a little fun with the original idea. The inspiration for the small size came from a trip to the market, where we go every weekend. This is a family business and we are all from Paris, so I think we learned just from eating the sandwiches all the time. The croque monsieur and croque madame are the common sandwiches that you eat for lunch in Paris, so we knew what it tasted like and how we wanted it to taste. Also Alison has been trained in a Michelin star restaurant so she has more of a restaurant background. When we came here, we had to find how to make it taste the same as it does in France, so we import the cured ham and the dijon mustard. First we have two slices of pullman bread, the fresher the better. Then we add creme fra\u00eeche, dijon mustard, cured ham, swiss cheese, salt and pepper. Then we close it, put a little butter of course, creme fra\u00eeche again, and then swiss cheese. I think we were often disappointed with the croque monsieur when we first came here because most of them were missing this last layer of caramelized cheese on top. They were more like paninis. For the croque madame, we then fry an egg on the side and put it on top at the last second. It is made on a very good baguette, which we call a retro baguette, because it is done in the old style and the time it takes for it to cook is much longer than a regular baguette. It is very airy, chewy, yet crunchy at the same time. So the ham butter sandwich is just the retro baguette, butter, ham, and cornichon. It is very simple but that\u2019s the secret. We work very closely with BreadBar, one of the oldest artisan houses for pastry in L.A. If you come here for a pastry, you come here for the kouign amann, which is made with croissant dough and sugar. Right now, for example, we have a wasabi tuna for the mini pullman sandwich, we have roast beef and mango chutney with a remoulade sauce for the toasted baguette, and for the retro baguette, we\u2019re doing a vegan sandwich. The concept came from being tired of the airport triangle sandwiches that taste bad and cost a fortune, so we designed our own packaged sandwiches with artisanal bread and fresh products. Each sandwich has its own packaging, like you would see in the chocolate industry.

Why speak of this pontifical document in a publication devoted to the spirituality of Saint Louis-Marie de Montfort? To begin with, a little reminder. The leitmotif or the thrust of the Second Vatican Council was aggiornamento, or in Latin accomodatio renovata, that is, opening and adaptation to the modern world. Simply put, it was, therefore, a case of marrying Catholic doctrine with the Atheism, Evolutionism, Modernism, Liberalism and immorality of the modern world. And herein lies the basic problem: how can you express Divine Revelation, that is, Catholic Faith and Morals, using the thought of today's world? Strictly speaking, it is a case of trying to square the circle. Now, to use terminology more proper to Saint Louis-Marie de Montfort, the problem of the Second Vatican Council was that of marrying Divine Wisdom with the wisdom of the world. Saint Louis Marie de Montfort dealt with this subject in The Love of Eternal Wisdom in Numbers 74 to 89. Father de Montfort explains that the world \u201csubtly [uses] the truth to inspire falsehood, virtue to authorize sin, and the very maxims of Jesus Christ to authorize its own\u201d (Number 79). Father Grignon also points out that worldly wisdom is \u201ca perfect conformity with the maxims and fashions of the world... not in a clumsy and blatant way, by committing some scandalous sin, but in a subtle, deceptive and political manner; otherwise it would no longer be wisdom in the eyes of the world, but license\u201d (Number 75). Finally, he defines the worldly person as someone \u201cwho makes a secret but deadly agreement between truth and falsehood, between the Gospel and the world, between virtue and sin\u201d (Number 76). A reminder of the doctrine of the indissolubility of marriage (in Numbers 52-53, 62, 77, 86, 123 and 178) and, at the same time, affirmations which grant divorced and remarried people the possibility of accessing the sacraments, that is to say Confession and Communion, without conversion, without contrition, without reparation for scandal, without ceasing to live in adultery and without ceasing their sin (in Numbers 243, 298-299, 301-305 and especially Note 351). To be convinced of this, the reader can refer to two easily accessible publications: DICI Number 345 of November 25 2016 and Le Courrier de Rome Number 595 of January 2017. De Montfort, with his eagle eye, saw the crux of the problem which currently occupies our attention: Conciliar wisdom consists in disguising falsehood under the mantle of truth, and vice under that of virtue. Thus, Amoris Laetitia, authorizes sacrilege under the pretext of being pastoral. This is so because he held to Catholic Doctrine, that of the Council of Trent, which in turn reiterates that of Saint Thomas Aquinas. In effect, history teaches us that, during this Council, two books were placed on the altar: The Bible or Sacred Scripture (Written Tradition) and the Summa Theologica of Saint Thomas Aquinas (representing Oral Tradition). And in those days, this Catholic Doctrine was not expressed with the help of an atheistic philosophy which is opposed to the Catholic Faith, but with the help of sane Aristotelian-Thomistic philosophy, known as the Philosophia Perennis, and which is \u201cthe Handmaid of Theology\u201d (Saint Thomas Aquinas).", "hit_ratio": 1.5089285714285714}, {"doc_text": "Read This Saint Louis De Montfort Book Summary To See If This Is The Right Book\"\nThis Saint Louis De Montfort Book Summary is here for you to read to see if this book is the next Mary Fabyan Windeatt read for you!

Sarah's eyes scanned the crowded coffee shop, the hiss of the espresso machine and the chatter of strangers creating a comforting background hum. She sat at the counter, nursing a cup of cold coffee, her thoughts a million miles away. The question had haunted her since the loss of her sister, Rachel, a year ago. Why hadn't God answered her prayers? Why had He let that happen to her family? The pain and anger still lingered, festering beneath the surface.\nAs she sat", "retrieved_docs": {"0": [{"doc_text": "Today is the final installment of our serial story, A Month Of Expectation. The storybook framework of Emma's carefully constructed future crumbled like a tired Vegas casino in the hands of a demolition crew. She turned away, sickened by the image of her beloved sister and fiance in a romantic--and obviously familiar--embrace. Emma grasped the banister with one hand and began to make her way down the fifteen flights of stairs. Why hadn't one of them said something to her? Had they played her for a fool all along? The hollow, empty ring of her footsteps on the concrete stairs echoed in her heart and chased her home to a tormenting refrain: What you sow, you shall also reap. If anyone deserved to reap the bitter flavor of betrayal it was Emma, and she knew it. She closed her eyes when her head touched the pillow only to have them snap open and stare into the darkness. Reason and logic warred with conscience and conviction. Reason said, \u201cstay the course.\u201d What did it matter that Thad and Jenny had once been involved with each other? Thad was right for her, and she was right for him. Their families approved of the marriage. Every detail was in place, from the seed pearls on her gown to the virginal white satin peignoir set wrapped in tissue and packed in her bridal luggage set. Emma took a deep breath and released it. Then, for the umpteenth time, she waited for the inner peace that should follow the right decision. In her mind's eye, everything she'd planned was perfect. But Emma couldn't ignore the pesky irritation coming from her conscience and the soft nudging she'd come to recognize as the conviction of the Holy Spirit. In her brief experience with God, she knew His plans outweighed anything she could arrange for herself, but was she willing to let go of the dreamy vision she'd created for her wedding day -- and for her life? The alarm bleeped just as the first beams of sunlight pierced the window. Emma turned her face into the light. Had she slept at all? \u201cLord, grant me the strength I need to do what's right in Your sight,\u201d she murmured. Forgive me, and help me to trust that You alone know what is best for me.\u201d Even as she whispered the final words, a gentle warmth poured through her soul like melted chocolate, providing sweetness and light for the difficult day ahead. She threw on jeans and a T-shirt instead of the white velour \u201cbride-to-be\u201d jogging suit she'd laid out, snatched up her car keys, and headed out the door. Although the day was warm, she kept the top on the convertible up. The part of town she'd be visiting wasn't the kind of place you left your doors unlocked or your car parked by the curb. But today she didn't have much choice. She shoehorned the car into a space in front of a rambling brick warehouse. With her lips set in a determined line, Emma stepped around a pile of dog excrement and marched to the door. She pushed the buzzer and planted her feet, lest she lose her nerve. The toe of her sneaker rapped the concrete with nervous impatience. Just when she was ready to whirl and run, the heavy steel door jerked open. The melted chocolate feeling she'd experienced earlier rushed back with the force of a flash flood so intense it weakened her knees. Dark hair curled past his tanned face and fell in waves past his shoulders, creating a stark contrast to the wrinkled white T-shirt that clung to his lean form. Bare feet stuck out below the ragged hems of worn blue jeans. His eyes, gray like a dove's wing, widened. He opened his mouth, but Emma held a finger to his lips. If he said anything at all, she'd lose her nerve. He blinked, but held her gaze as he grasped her fingers and pressed a gentle kiss on the sensitive inside of her wrist. His voice resonated all the way to the marrow of her bones and shot an involuntary shudder down her spine. The bitterness was only evident in his eyes for a flash. He scrubbed a hand against his unshaven cheek and she wondered at the rough, red places on his knuckles. They rolled together onto the grubby linoleum and poured years of unspent passion into a kiss that should have left burn marks. If you were Remy would you be willing to take her back? now i like Emma a whole lot better. good for her to realize her best laid plans were mere dust to what the Lord apparently has planned for her.

Fooling herself into believing that she could be so lucky. That the gods of fortune could smile on her after all she'd done. Everything he said suddenly had double, even triple meanings. She drove herself to distraction, trying to sort it all out. Suss out how to be the sort of woman a man like him would want for more than just the night, or to watch his back in a fight, should it come to that.

Cross-posted in a million different places - I apologize if this ends up on your friends page five times! Ambition ruled all; there was no time for feeling sorry for yourself because you had no real friends at school and the Cheerios went out of their way to make your daily life a living hell. With every titter as she passed them in the hallways, with every nasty remark left on her MySpace, with every icy, neon-coloured slushie tossed in her face, she'd learned to grit her teeth and repeat her mantra over and over again in her head as she tried not to cry - When I'm famous, they'll all be begging for my autograph! It worked, because she truly believed it. She had to. Glee was part of the Master Plan, of course. It was the only place at school where she felt remotely safe, where she felt a little bit like she actually belonged. (She'd considered, at first, a crush on him, but she'd quickly vetoed the idea and wrestled her mind back in line. There was room for romance in the Master Plan, but it wasn't supposed to happen like this. She'd fall for the leading man and love him from afar, thinking he'd never notice a lowly chorus member... but then one day, she'd be singing alone on the stage after everyone else had left rehearsal, and he'd hear her as he was leaving the theatre. He'd be struck by her pitch-perfect voice and stop to see who was singing, and after he introduced himself that day, they'd strike up a friendship. When one of the understudies for the female lead dropped out of the show, he'd casually recommend her to the director as a replacement, and by the end of the year, she'd have climbed the ranks to become his leading lady both on and off stage. Crushing on a football player-turned-singer who barely knew what a musical was was definitely not part of the Master Plan. She knew that she shouldn't let him affect her mood this much, shouldn't let him matter this much, but somehow, she'd let Finn Hudson waltz into her life and very quickly begin poking giant holes in her once ironclad Master Plan. She kept telling herself he didn't matter, kept reminding herself that really, she barely knew him, but that was the thing - the fact that she had to remind herself at all was a pretty big problem. She didn't have time for these constant reminders, and she definitely didn't have time to think about him constantly, the way she'd found herself doing lately. She didn't like the way his presence threw her focus completely off balance; she didn't like suddenly feeling nervous and anxious - her, Rachel Berry, heart-flutteringly nervous! - every time she walked into a Glee rehearsal, knowing he'd be there. But she didn't know how to stop it, because for the first time in her life, she'd run into something she didn't know how to control. She can't fix it with a plan or a list; she can't fix it with practice or study or diligence. Her heart and mind aren't working in the orderly way they usually did, and the loss of control scares her. They're like sparks, the moments she's had with him, little specks of electricity that flared up unexpectedly and burned out bright and fast. There was warmth in the moments, and a strangely consuming joy, but they all went by so fast that sometimes, she can't even remember everything that was said and done. Hold on, her mind says, hold on to the moment, but the moments fade away into a diffused glow and then burn out completely, leaving her grey. For some reason, he makes her happy. He smiles and she wants to keep that smile with her for so much longer than it lasts; his eyes catch hers and she thinks, They're shining, and she feels like the biggest cheeseball in the world, but it's true. His real world is football and cheerleaders, parties and popularity; Glee was still the semi-embarrassing secret life that lurked in his dark corners. But he smiles at her anyhow, and goes out of his way to talk to her at rehearsals, and sometimes she wonders, Why me? And then she wonders if it would make a difference if that was her, if she could be a little less this and a little more that. She hates herself for thinking it, because it's so, so ridiculous - to even think about wanting to be more like those brainless, self-absorbed ditzes - such a girl thought she'd never thought she'd have, but it's there. She should hate him for it, for inadvertently being the one to plant such a stupid, un-Rachel-Berry-like thought in her head, but she doesn't. Be friendly, be professional, but be done with this crush nonsense, because nothing good could ever come of it. There was no point dreaming about could bes and could have beens... no point thinking about the last words he'd said to her, the last time he'd smiled. There was no point to any of it, because for every time he smiled at her and momentarily filled her world with joy, there were multiple times when she'd remember that smile and hurt so badly that she forgot how to breathe... because when she walked down the hall, she wasn't walking with him. It didn't matter to him that Quinn struggled to keep her head above water in classes Rachel coasted through confidently, didn't matter that she wouldn't know a thing about what was going on in the world outside of Lima. Rachel Berry didn't believe in crushes, but somehow, she'd found herself deeply in the midst of one, and didn't know what to do. :D Great, great, great job!", "hit_ratio": 1.5789473684210527}], "1": [{"doc_text": "Perhaps it\u2019s the subtle, inviting coffee scent that perfumes the air or the barely audible alternative music that sings in the background.

She didn't stop though, repeating her concern for the pregnant woman and her unborn child: \"NO YOU CAN'T HAVE IT, YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED.\" Then she took the coffee out of her hand and dropped it into the bin beside the counter. The now-fuming pregnant woman explained to the older lady that her doctor has cleared her to have the one cup of coffee. The barista went about making a replacement. \"Please leave me alone,\" she asked of the coffee-stealing woman. I get one cup a day, this is it. Please go away.\" The older woman began to yell: \"NO YOU CAN'T HAVE IT YOU'RE PREGNANT, IT WILL MAKE YOU HAVE THE BABY NOW YOU CAN'T DO IT I WON'T LET MY DAUGHTER DO IT EITHER BUT SHE DRINKS IT ANYWAY AND IF I CAN'T SAVE HER I'LL SAVE YOU INSTEAD.\" Finally, the replacement coffee was ready and the barista leaned over to hand it directly to the woman, when the other lady tried to take it from her again. \"So I yelled for her to stop trying to come near me,\" said the woman in her post. \"I literally, loudly (and even now have a bit of a shake from doing it), shouted 'PLEASE LEAVE ME ALONE.

Maybe she would rest peacefully for the first time in years, under the same roof as her brother.

She needed to be away from the house and its Shadows. She had tried to tell her brother countless times that the house was haunted, but he never believed her. A few weeks later Rachel was in counseling. She was ten. It was a good diagnosis, except Rachel had no memory of the wreck. She only knew the story. They were coming home from a barbeque on the Fourth of July. He ran a red light and hit a van head on. Rachel\u2019s parents and the woman in the van were both killed. Rachel and Gavin, ages four and five, were strapped into their car seats and received only minor bruises. Rachel couldn\u2019t remember anything from the night or the accident, but she certainly felt trauma. She tried to ignore the Shadows, because she wanted to believe they were her own invention. Her therapist\u2019s \u201crepressed memories\u201d theory went out the window. She went to the hospital after her first nightmare. She was found lying at the bottom of the staircase, unconscious. Once they found her standing and screaming in the middle of her bed, clawing at her own face. When she turned eighteen, even when she learned there would be no inheritance, she was determined to get out. She thought leaving the house would make the terrors stop. She believed she was being possessed and haunted by some evil in her grandparents\u2019 house. But leaving didn\u2019t do any good. The Shadows followed. The torment is worse now, because she doesn\u2019t have her family to help her hide. A roommate is completely out of the question. For ten years, she\u2019s been trying to pretend that everything is okay. She has to face that house, the place where it all started, and find a way to stop the Shadows. She leans back, sits upright in her seat, away from the window. She shakes her head, feels the light sting of her ponytail slapping her cheeks.

Fr Martin Ganeri finds no answer to the problem of suffering, but perhaps a solution. Some years back, just a few weeks after being ordained a priest, I found myself chaplain for a month at one of the London hospitals. One day I was called to the bedside of a young boy dying of cancer. His parents were there and we all sat together for the last few hours of his life. At one point the mother asked, 'Why does God let this happen?' An obvious question, a natural question, but still the kind you dread. I had no answer that could satisfy the bewilderment that a mother feels as she watches her son die, let alone soothe the pain. All I could do was to be with them in those hours, to offer the sacraments, to pray with and for them. Two years later I too found myself asking that same question, 'Why does God let this happen?' Though perhaps more easily in the face of old age comes the answer that this is only natural, the way our bodies are, still it did not satisfy the questions I had about why it had to happen to him, why he had to be the one to suffer that fate, satisfy the deeper yearning that I had for more time, for his company for longer. In the passage for today from the book of Job, God is said to give Job an answer as he asks, 'Why does God let this happen?' Throughout the many chapters of that book many others have tried to find an answer that will meet Job's bewilderment, his anger and his pain. He has lost his health and reputation. Why had God let this happen to him, when he has done nothing wrong? None of the answers others give can satisfy him. Perhaps God, however, will explain why he has done this to Job, why he lets it happen. Is Job on a level with God the creator either in power or knowledge, so that God should explain himself to Job? The wisdom and justice of creation and of the fate of each being within it is understood by God, yet it remains beyond the reach of men and women. In the end Job receives no straightforward answer to his questions, but is reduced to silence in the awesome presence of God. The questions he kept on asking and the answers he searched for, are themselves transcended in this great theophany, in this experience of the divine. Well, we might think, that is our experience too, though without the comfort -- if that is what it is -- of such a display of divine presence. And yet, if not an answer, we do find here the beginnings of a solution. God is the creator and there is a wisdom and justice in his creation even if this lies outside our comprehension. God is also not absent from the bewilderment and pain of those who suffer in his creation. Do you not care? Why do you let this happen? The same question once again. The solution Jesus offers us is his own suffering, a suffering which finally will mean the end of all our suffering, which finally will mean a new life in God's new creation. This is not an answer in any straightforward sense and the many attempts to explain the Passion of Christ in the New Testament or in the Church's tradition can never fully satisfy us if we ask why God let it happen.

As soon as sin entered the world, our world began to decay, and this includes the human body as well.

We live in a fallen world, and because we live in a fallen world bad things happen. Let me suggest that the real question we should be asking is \u201cWhy not, God? Why not me?\u201d To live in this present world is to live in a world of suffering \u2014 a trouble free life is abnormal. 4. God will help us find purpose in our suffering. Romans 8:28 says that God works all things out for the good of those who love Him. This verse does not say that God causes bad things to happen, or that God has a reason for everything. However, He has worked in her life through her suffering. Romans 8:28 is being lived out in her life on a daily basis. 5. God wants us to help the suffering.

Also, I think that he sees everything that Bella has to lose by becoming a vampire. She won\u2019t be able to go near her family or friends for a while because she would lust for their blood. Alice has a vision of the dance studio and the proceeds to question Bella about any reasons why she might go there. It seems to me that Alice saw Bella at the studio. Why didn't Alice clear this up for Bella by explaining to her that she shouldn't go to the studio? I don\u2019t think that Alice saw Bella in the studio until a little before they arrived at the airport. When she did see the vision, I think that she let it happen because she knew that Bella would survive it and that it was to only way for them to catch and kill James. Alice knows just how much Bella means to her brother, and she does not want to lose her brother or see him suffer for centuries on end. She also cares very much for Bella, and wouldn't want to see anything bad happen to her new-found friend. However, I think her main reason is that she would be so concerned for Edward, especially since he would go to the Volturi to get himself killed. Really, to me, he's only creepy in the movies. In the books he seems very calm. He also cares about the family, even though he does still struggle a bit with the lifestyle. 3. I did feel concern about the fact that the transformation is so painful. So here was when we found out that Bella was in for a lot of pain and suffering in the future. 4. Why do you suppose Edward has been so adamant about not telling Bella how someone becomes a vampire? I'm pretty sure that Alice has seen Bella as a vampire, but that Edward is determined to make sure that Alice is wrong and Bella remains human. I think he shows how much he can care, and I think he demonstrates more self control than he probably realises he's got. No. Again, Edward wouldn't have done that if it was going to endanger Bella. I knew that they meant he would be in a dark place if anything ever happen to her. I didn't think about suicide until I read NM. He knew that their relationship was evolving, he didn't want her to want to be changed, or know how to do it, in fear if she asked him, he would decline, then she would look some other way to become one.

Eventually the pain will become increasingly evident with swelling and redness spreading to the surface area as well. In order for the wound to heal, the surface skin must be lanced allowing the infection to drain. If the wound is deep enough, a \u201cwick\u201d will be added to insure all infection will be drawn out and washed away. No real, complete healing can take place until all festering infection has been removed from the wound. By looking at the many unfolding events, as scary as some of them at first glance appear to be, we can choose to see them as a wound being lanced. So much frustration on so many levels has built up over the years and try as we may, no real healing can begin in our society, our humanity, our families, our global connections, as well as our connection to Gaia and all that inhabit her until the wound is first lanced.

Being the wick of love does not mean we do not feel all of the unpleasant emotions of anger, hurt, disappointment, etc. It takes great strength to hold the space and be the wick of love. Most of all it takes the depth of unconditional love to wait patiently, to lovingly BE the wick of love for what may take months, years or even lifetimes for true healing to occur.

And, the better you get at coping with your anger, the more space you create to give and receive love. When I became a certified Parent Effectiveness Trainer (PET) through the Gordon Training Institute, I was taught a wonderful metaphor for our feelings \u2013 The Feelings Iceberg. Remember that only 10% of an iceberg shows above the oceans surface, 90% lies submerged and hiding. While anger may show on the surface, beneath the surface can be sadness, pain, fear, shame, hurt, and more. Physiologically, the part of our brain that is responsible for feeling, the brain stem, only experiences pleasure or pain. Then the thinking part of the brain, the cerebral cortex, analyzes, distorts, deletes, generalizes, compares, judges, categorizes the feeling into anger or fear or whatever. Then language is applied to the thought, further defining and categorizing. In actuality, you\u2019ve exposed 10% of the iceberg and ignored the other 90%, crashing into the submerged part and, perhaps, tearing a big hole in your relationship. A key strategy for coping with anger, your\u2019s or anyone else\u2019s, is to look at the entire iceberg, to find out what is under the anger.

The first type includes a stewing or festering that brews just below the surface and doesn\u2019t come out. The Greek word is orgizo used in Ephesians 4:26\u2014\u201cBe angry (orgizo), but do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger (parogizo) and give no opportunity to the devil.\u201d Paul is saying to feel the anger but not to sin by refusing to deal with the festering anger below the surface, which gives the devil a place in your life. The third type of anger is what Galatians 5:20 refers to as \u201coutbursts of anger\u201d or \u201cfits of rage.\u201d The Greek word is thymos, or rage, which passionately erupts and then cools down quickly, whereas the orgizo is indignation that gradually builds and settles in. Many people don\u2019t think they have a problem with anger but are sarcastic, passive aggressive, numb, depressed, or apathetic. Then they say things to others, often acting like a victim, to get other people to confront or speak for them, because they can\u2019t approach the person with whom they have a problem. In an attempt to keep the peace, they push down all negative feelings to avoid hurting the people around them. They live in a constant state of numbness, and their anger has become frozen. Rather than caring and feeling continual hurt, fear, or powerlessness, a person chooses not to care so he or she can function in everyday life. If they spilled their drinks at the table, I went into a rage. If they started whining at the grocery store, I would take them into the bathroom or car and spank them. I felt disrespected, humiliated, and exposed as a bad mother because they wouldn\u2019t listen to me, and I used my power to make them pay. It makes no sense that I expected an 18-month-old, 2-year-old, and 4-year-old who were tired and hungry to handle a long day that ended at the grocery store without complaint. I finally determined to be honest about my feelings and seek the help I needed. When I told my husband about my over-the-top behavior toward our children, he initially passed my anger off as just a reaction to a bad day. Thankfully, he didn\u2019t respond with more shame but encouraged me to talk with our senior pastor (the one who preached the sermon about not being OK), and I began to meet with him and his wife for the next four months to deal with the root of my anger instead of the symptoms. The interesting part of the story is that my husband was the associate pastor of the same church. Anger is what presents itself to others, but the primary emotion is underneath the anger. Understanding these six causes helped me identify the hurt and deal with it. Fear can be a strong emotion causing people to feel weak, vulnerable, and powerless, so they rise up in anger to push people away and regain a sense of control. The rush of adrenaline that accompanies anger makes a person feel strong and hides the hidden terror. Everyone wants to be heard whether in a business meeting or at the dinner table. To criticize someone\u2019s viewpoint or, worse yet, ignore the person completely, can cause anger. This attitude is where road rage stems from\u2014\u201cGet out of my way!\u201d Whether a person\u2019s car is cut off on the freeway, or the budget is cut dissolving the business plan, or a 2-year-old is told no, anger results. It is probably the most volatile of all the underlying causes because it erupts spontaneously. When a person is hurt, the offense is either turned inward, leading to despair or depression, or turned outward, leading to anger and bitterness. When turned inward, the person seeks to contain the anger by taking it out on him/herself, and self-rejection and self-hatred results. Turning the hurt outward can lead to blame and seeking revenge toward the person who hurt you. The healthy response to hurt is to feel the sadness, loss, and pain of the wounding. 5. Name calling and inappropriate comments about your gender, ethnicity, sexuality, or beliefs fit this category. Outwardly people might smile or play along, but inwardly the very core of the person has been touched, and it hurts. The angry person flies off the handle because of an unfulfilled expectation that is never spoken to the person receiving the anger. The angry person assumes the expectation is obvious, so he or she doesn\u2019t need to communicate it directly. The next time you get angry, pause for a moment and sift through these six areas to identify the underlying cause of your anger. We can\u2019t rid ourselves of anger because it is an emotion; however, we can learn to appropriately deal with the real issue underlying the anger so it doesn\u2019t fester or spew in unhealthy ways to hurt people around us. Here are five ways to self\u2013check your anger level for your personal soul care. 1. Acknowledge the way in which anger generally surfaces in your life\u2014aggression, passive-aggressiveness, sarcasm, numbness, apathy, depression, or rage. 2. Ask the Holy Spirit to help you identify the underlying issue as the source: fear, invalidation, blocked goals, woundedness, attacks on your personhood, or unmet expectations. 3. Ask for help so you don\u2019t suffer in silence. Telling a close friend, spouse, or counselor about your anger disarms its power in your mind. 4. Grieve the loss accompanying the pain to process all the feelings surrounding the incident. 5. Choose to forgive the offender. Satan is a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.

It is there because someone feels like they have been taken for granted. There is always a thank you, but never a thank you note. Resolution is found for others because listening is easy and having the ability to help them put the puzzle of competing feelings, emotions, and facts together to build a concrete plan comes naturally. But, some find when the time comes for reciprocation of this support, it is unavailable. Do they believe the facade of all is well because your life looks so put together from the outside? Or, the answer to a lack of support could be, they simply do not realize they are behaving in that way. From love to anger and resentment is a razor-thin line, and when walking that edge the decision is whether to tell them or let that anger or resentment go. Anger comes when people feel unappreciated, not supported emotionally, and not heard when they need someone close to listen. Because, when anger bubbles and sizzles just beneath the surface, it is like a volcano building pressure or a pot of water about to boil over. Whether cooling it off or releasing the tension, something has to give to prevent a massive eruption that can have long-lasting effects on the relationship. What do you do to ease the pressure and temperature building up? If squashing the anger is a usual reaction, then like the magma of a volcano, the action only increases the pressure until a buildup of volcanic gases causes an eruption to occur. When it comes to anger, angst, or frustration, the question really becomes to release or not to release. If released, will it escalate into a full-blown argument where words said can never be recalled and the pain they cause worse than the hurt inflicted by the instigating event? There are times when even the best \u2018filter\u2019 is overridden by the angst and there is nothing that will stop those words spoken in anger. While you try to remain calm when angry, it is difficult, especially when repetitive behavior causes you to feel like you are taken for granted. To diffuse the situation and make a point, pick a spot and tell them without making it an attack on their behavior. To keep anger and hurt at bay make sure you take time to listen, and, also, set boundaries to be sure your needs are met as well. Without reciprocation in a relationship, anger and resentment will bubble just beneath the surface threatening the well-being of not only the individuals but the relationship. Remember to listen, love, and understand that they need the same support you do. By creating a healthy relationship, you can avoid the witch\u2019s brew of anger and resentment.

For a brief moment, among the torrent of feelings and memories flooding my mind, I thought the old me might resurface, too. \u201cDani,\u201d I breathed. My eyes met hers, and I used the comfort I found in them as my anchor amid the impressions of foreign lifetimes competing for space in my mind. Images of Jason and Dani flickered in my head, but instead of trying to push them away, I let them come, vivid and countless as they were. With what felt like a breath of life, I inhaled, and everything in my mind\u2019s eye sharpened. As unsteady as I felt, the clarity brought a sense of relief I hadn\u2019t expected, and the dark recesses of my mind filled with colors and shapes and sounds\u2014recollections of the past. Dani and Jason\u2019s pasts, but not mine. Everything I saw\u2014everything I felt\u2014was new and unexplored; my mind, once an empty cave, suddenly housed echoes of the past, assembling them into an irrefutable truth that seemed to lighten the darkness and partially fill the lingering void inside me. But as abruptly as the emotions assaulted me, they vanished, and I felt empty again\u2014the images and feelings were nothing more than fading memories. \u201cYeah?\u201d he said, sounding unsure. Jason frowned. \u201cWell\u2026it\u2019s your choice,\u201d he mumbled, and although he seemed baffled, he nodded. In an instant, another flurry of guilt, frustration, and despair swirled around in my mind. Like a camera shutter opening and closing, I saw Dani for the first time. Yes, she was a fiery, red-haired pixie with bright green eyes and a seemingly carefree nature, but she also felt lost and afraid and confused. I could feel everything\u2014her undeniable love for Jason, and the relentless shadow of a not-too-long-ago broken heart. My best friend, who I only knew from her coalescing memories and our stilted conversations over the past week, stood in front of me, and now I understood why she seemed to cry at the drop of a hat. Her emotions were so raw, rampant, and fierce that they almost brought tears to my eyes. Enthralled by the insight I felt bringing me closer to Dani, I vaguely registered Jason walking away. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d Her voice teetered between panic and remorse, and I could feel the questions practically jumping off her tongue. Dani eyed me curiously, her fingers stroking the sling cradling her injured arm. Dani\u2019s eyes widened as fear replaced her curiosity, and the jumble of images focused, a tumultuous memory flashing prominently through her mind. Dani stood in a stark office, a perfectly organized desk separating her from Dr. Wesley, who was sitting behind it. I blame you,\u201d she seethed and stormed to the door. The memory faded, leaving in its place violent emotions tangled in my gut, nearly bringing me to my knees. Dr. Wesley is my mom\u2026 I\u2019d completely forgotten that. I hedged. \u201cBut she\u2019s our mom, Dani. \u201cShe\u2019s your mom and she killed nearly everyone to keep you guys safe.\u201d Dani closed her eyes and took a deep breath, her eyes pleading when she reopened them. \u201cPlease, Zo. Don\u2019t say anything. He\u2019s not ready. Rough laughter startled me, and I glanced over to the cart to see Jason and Carlos chatting as they sat on the bench, whittling. Although I had the impression that Jason wouldn\u2019t want me to pry around inside his head, I needed to; I needed to understand why Dani was so adamant to keep the truth from him. Focusing beyond her swirling emotions, I searched for Jason\u2019s. While Dani\u2019s were easy to access, an invisible wall surrounded Jason\u2019s, cold and excruciatingly controlled. I focused harder. It was difficult with Dani so close, her emotions so intense, but I could see and feel just enough from Jason to understand. Standing there, with only a brief impression of who he was fresh in my mind, I felt closer to him than I probably ever would have had my Ability remained dormant. Learning that our mom was still alive, that she\u2019d made the choice to leave when Jason was a young child, and that she\u2019d been the cause of so much death would devastate him, especially while the real me wasn\u2019t around to help bear the weight of the discovery.

As I took a few steps toward Harper and Chris, I stumbled, the bombardment of their worries, memories, and emotions throwing me off kilter. Dropping his armful of firewood, Harper jogged the final few steps between us to lend me a supporting hand. I snickered.

Harper helped me over to lean against a lone tree trunk growing along the edge of the pond. His memories and feelings resonated within me, and I mentally waded through the streaming information, effortlessly absorbing pieces of who he was.

At a staggering 400,000 words, Matt was forced to split his novel up into three books, the first of which,Spirit Summoner, is due later in 2013. He lives in Western Washington with his wife, Jen, and son, Jacobi. How would you describe Spirit Summoner: The Chosen of the Light\u2019s protagonist, Darr? Darr has an ability that allows him to hear the voices of the spirits, an ability that many liken to a handicap. He\u2019s comfortable enough with his abilities and his control over them to live a perfectly normal life, but he lives wanting to know more about the power that can leave him disabled at times. Once he discovers the true power at his fingertips, he finds himself way in over his head. Darr loves exploring the country around his home, he\u2019s fascinated with Ictarian history and geography, and well, let\u2019s just say he has a long story ahead of him. Now tell us three things about yourself that we won\u2019t find on your website. My all-time favorite gift came as a complete surprise from my best friend\u2026it was a full size replica for the Buster Sword from Final Fantasy VII. Darr and I share a thirst for exploration, but for both of us, this is a double-edged sword. As great as it is to explore, it takes you away from home. I learned deep breathing techniques in college to help with stress and mood changes, techniques Darr uses to keep himself separated from the spirit world. How did you come up with the Spirit Summoner, the Sephirs and the Devoid? The Sephirs have always been the most fascinating to me because they\u2019re based off the classical four elements. Of course, it only seems natural to have a person who can harness these elements. Enter the Spirit Summoner and the Devoid, two entities who can control the elements and who can do so for very different reasons. Both authors are great storytellers of the fantastic. When you are not writing, reading or working, what do you do to refresh and relax? Reading comics, woodworking in the shop and at home, and going for bike rides are all great fun. However, none of them holds a candle to a good RPG video game. I love games with deeply involved stories. Every night since the Archon\u2019s departure, Darr had gone into the Currents and searched for him. He tried calling out to the spirit creature, but his voice didn\u2019t carry in the Currents like it did in the physical world. One other option remained, but the thought of it terrified him. Darr chewed at his lower lip and stared across the room at Erec and Jinn. The bright flame of a candle danced on the table beside the bed, sending up shadows across the walls. Jinn glanced over at him with a questioning look. \u201cWhat\u2019re you thinking, Darr?\u201d she asked. \u201cGone. Where are you going?\u201d Erec asked with skepticism thick in his voice. \u00ad\u00ad\u2026he entered the Currents in a smooth, soundless rush. The wisteria light of the spirit realm spread out before him, laced with the blues and yellows, reds and greens of the Four Elements. The beauty of the place radiated so much awe it made him want to cry. Darr wanted to reach out and touch them, to feel what they were feeling, but he resisted the temptation. He quieted his mind and expanded his senses further, yet another lesson he\u2019d learned from Racall. In doing so, the forms of Erec and Jinn receded into the wisteria light, leaving him alone with the fuzzballs of illumination that were the spirits. They danced and swirled all about him, their voices faint and indistinct. The voices startled him. Racall had taught him how to shut out their voices until he was ready to hear them. A faint tugging sensation pulled at Darr\u2019s mind, a warning perhaps. \u201cI\u2019m looking for the Archon of Earth. The spirits began to spin madly about him. Fragmented images tumbled into Darr\u2019s mind. In all of these images, he saw Racall. The spirits were showing him the ways in which Racall spread the magic of his Sephir out across Ictar, his physical presence by the loosest definition. The Summoner struggled against the images flooding into his head, trying to find an end to the web the spirits wove into his own Light. Darr\u2019s emotions rose to the surface. The spirits didn\u2019t hear him. The white pinpricks of light came swarming out of the ether. They touched him, weaving their minuscule bodies in and out of his own Light, a repulsive sensation. They were feeding off his emotions, and in turn, he began to feed off theirs. The memories and emotions of the spirits poured through his mind and soul, and in doing so, he had difficulty remembering anything about himself. The calming hue of the Currents, and the spinning white lights of the spirits, were all he was aware of. Something clicked in his mind, a tugging sensation. Something was wrong, but he\u2019d fallen too far into the Currents to figure it out. Yet, another name had been preserved in the depths of his mind, a name he knew would free him. But he mustn\u2019t speak it. A jolt of certainty coursed through him as he uttered the name, an utterance he made with only his Light. Wisteria light gave way to green and a massive shape exploded between the Summoner and the spirits. The ethereal forms scattered in every direction across the Currents. Darr\u2019s memories cascaded down into his head, returning him to himself. First and foremost, he heard Racall\u2019s lesson that the spirits were not to be trifled with for they would make him one of them. Racall\u2019s broad shape materialized out of the green light, reflecting a number of emotions Darr didn\u2019t know the Archon possessed, worry and relief. \u201cI hope you have learned a valuable lesson, young Reintol,\u201d he said in the familiar harmonized voice. Racall motioned towards a light spot in the spirit realm. The forms of Erec and Jinn appeared before them, their Lights unchanged since Darr began his journey into the Currents.

Woods. The book has been published by the Dalkey Archive. As you can see in the picture above: Enormous. (This is the wrong question). The novel begins around 4 AM on Midsummer\u2019s Day 1968 in the L\u00fcneburg Heath in northeastern Lower Saxony in northern Germany, and concludes twenty-five hours later. It follows the lives of 54-year-old Daniel Pagenstecher, visiting translators Paul Jacobi and his wife Wilma, and their 16-year-old daughter Franziska. The story is concerned with the problems of translating Edgar Allan Poe into German and with exploring the themes he conveys, especially regarding sexuality. The obvious easy reference point here is Joyce\u2019s Finnegans Wake, which indeed Schmidt was actively following, both in form and style: competing columns, a fragmentary and elusive/allusive style, collage-like metacommentary, an etymological explosion\u2014words as paint, text as meaning. Etc. I\u2019ll never forget one of my graduate school professors warning us not to \u201cpeer too long into Finnegans Wake.\u201d He called it an abyss. (The man loved Joyce\u2019s work, by the way, and had studied under Hugh Kenner. It was, like I say, a warning). This physical reaction goes beyond the size of the volume\u2014although there\u2019s certainly something to the size. I more or less have to read the thing on my dining room table; it\u2019s dreadfully uncomfortable on a couch, and probably impossible on my hammock or in the bathtub. I can\u2019t really hold it while I read it. The multiple columns, marginalia, images, etc. are engaging but also fragment my attention\u2014and I generally find myself flicking through Bottom\u2019s Dream, rather than sustaining the will to follow the \u201cplot.\u201d Right now, anyway, I find myself wrapped up in the aesthetics of reading Bottom\u2019s Dream. I enjoy it most when I smooth my hands over it, jump out of the stream, 20, 30, 100 pages forward, backwards. Relax a little. Otherwise, Bottom\u2019s Dream becomes a bit of a nightmare for me: I get all dizzy, thirsty, my eyes seem to thrum. Something going on in the inner-ear. It\u2019s like a slow-motion panic attack. Poe might be something of a guide for me if I do try to stick out wandering through Bottom\u2019s Dream, and his story \u201cA Descent into the Maelstrom,\u201d referenced above, seems a particularly nice parallel to Schmidt\u2019s bigass book. \u201cDescent\u201d relates the tale of a sailor (a voyager!\u2013a, like, metaphorical reader, y\u2019know) transformed by his encounter with the \u201cMoskoestrom\u201d \u2014a swirling abyss from which no one returns. This vortex, \u201cabsurd and unintelligible,\u201d breaks the sailor, \u201cbody and soul.\u201d He can\u2019t comprehend the storm. It\u2019s unknowable, un-nameable. And not only is his glance broken, but all of his senses are fragmented. He escapes the maelstrom, but is unrecognizable to the sailors who rescue him. He becomes the voice of the vortex, the metonymy of a force he can perceive but can\u2019t comprehend. The maelstrom\u2014the vortex, the abyss\u2014this, for Poe, was language.

A hell he could not escape \u2013 a hell which consisted of the nearly crippling pain in his chest. Of the vision of Percy's eyes, filled with anger and hatred, with distrust and betrayal. If he'd ever be able to forgive himself for the pain he'd caused. He'd needed to protect Percy, even if it caused him pain. Hopefully, one day Percy would understand, if not forgive.

The pain, the horror, the disappointment and betrayal. He'd hit the one nerve Percy had, the one insecurity he couldn't let go of.

Financiers often require the directors of a company borrower (SMEs as well as big corporations) to give personal guarantees before providing finance for business purposes.

Jayne \"Savior of the Town\" Cobb. He must've glared at his hands just a bit longer than he'd intended, because when he looked up again Jayne was wearing the same mischievous grin he always did, but he seemed to have moved closer somehow. Huh. Wondered how he'd missed that. Jayne leaned over even closer, Simon sinking back to accommodate him and losing his breath at the proximity. The rifleman was so close now he could smell every scent he'd always imagined there was. Whiskey, the good stuff. The hard peppermint candies he'd always 'procured' from Preacher's stash when he thought no one was looking. Jayne's arm settled around the back of the couch they shared, resting against the curve of Simon's shoulders and sending another spark of heat through him. \"No one said nothin' 'bout killin' you, Doc.\" He supposed if someone glanced at them from behind, they would see two close friends, sharing a story or some such notion.

Under the auspices of the Detroit Association for the Study of African American Life and History (ASALH - Detroit), the service will include a wreath laying along with a presentation by 102nd USCT re-enactors. Born free in Fredricksburg, Va., in 1815, DeBaptiste learned the barber's trade as a boy, and became a kind of valet to a wealthy southerner, with whom he traveled extensively. After his move to Madison, Ind., DeBaptiste became acquainted with William Henry Harrison, who would become president of the United States. During Harrison's brief tenure. DeBaptiste, who was fond of Harrison, became a steward of the White House, attending to the president until the president's death. DeBaptiste and his wife returned to Madison where he opened a barbershop and began his deep involvement with the abolitionist movement. The Ohio River, which Madison overlooks, was a destination for runaway slaves because it was a boundary between free Indiana and slave-holding Kentucky. Responsible for the freedom of hundreds of slaves, DeBaptiste would sometimes walk 20 miles a night, often in pouring rain, to fetch freedom seekers hidden in boats, and set them on a path to Detroit and ultimately, Windsor, Ont. In 1846, following a virulent spate of anti-black violence, DeBaptiste fled Madison for Detroit. During this time, DeBaptiste was, by turns, a baker, caterer, clothier, restaurateur and real estate holder. Again, he would make his mark on the abolitionist front. He bought the steamship the T. Whitney, hired a white man to pilot it, and risked his life secretely ferrying freedom seekers to Canada. During this time, DeBaptiste served as a delegate to the Cleveland National Convention of Colored Citizens, as an agent for the Freedman's Aid Commission, and as a member of the Colored Vigilant Committee of Detroit. In 1859, he was one of the chosen abolitionists to meet in Detroit with Frederick Douglass and John Brown to hear Brown's plans for armed rebellion at Harper's Ferry, West Virginia. During the Civil War, DeBaptiste helped to organized the First Michigan Colored Infantry, also known as the 102nd United States Colored Troops. DeBaptiste traveled all over Michigan recruiting. Named a sutler, he followed the regiment to its campaign in South Carolina. Following the war, DeBaptiste returned to his beloved Detroit. Having sold the steamboat, he dedicated most of his time to politics. On a local level, for example, he sought to put young black students on an equal footing with their white counterparts. On the national front, he worked for the passing of the 15th Amendment -- which prohibits the denial of citizens' right to vote -- and to the 13th Amendment, the abolition of slavery. By the time he died of stomach cancer in 1875, he'd seen both efforts come to fruition. Elmwood Cemetery is at 1200 Elmwood St. in Detroit, 48207, near Calvary Baptist Church. The Association for the Study of African American Life and History (ASALH.org) was founded in 1915by Carter G. Woodson, known as the father of black history. The organization is dedicated to the study and appreciation of African-American history.", "hit_ratio": 1.1061946902654867}, {"doc_text": "Over on the Paizo boards, someone mentioned a post Ed made on Candlekeep, and a quick Google search brought me here. big fan of Forgotten Realms books, read all ed greenwoods Elminster books ( except elminster daughter) which is on order now. read the shandril saga books very good and the seven sisters.

Yet 20 years ago, the international community turned away as 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutu were killed within 100 days. Today the Montreal Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies at Concordia University stands with the people of Rwanda to remember those who lost their lives and support the survivors of this tragedy. We did not act. As the on-going massacres in Syria, South Sudan and the Central African Republic prove, we still fail to act on the lessons of the Rwandan genocide and the other genocides of the past one hundred years. Generating the political will to prevent mass atrocities remains one of the central challenges today. And so, as we pay tribute to the victims and survivors of the genocide, we must renew our commitment. In 2005, the 192 governments of the United Nations renewed their commitment to the \u201cresponsibility to protect.\u201d Canadian diplomats led the international community in mobilizing support for this emerging doctrine that seeks to break the cycle of choosing to look the other way when mass atrocities occur. Today, instead of standing on the sidelines, we urge the Prime Minister of Canada to enlarge this tradition by making mass atrocity prevention\u2014the prevention of genocide, crimes against humanity, and ethnic cleansing, in particular\u2014a national security priority and a vital part of Canada\u2019s foreign policy.

In the hours of loneliness and darkness that His soul was heaving with, what was His antidote to that? Long hours of emotional, intimate prayer with God. It seems like after He was done with his marathon prayer, He faced His accusers silently and watched His friends walk away from Him in silence. Was His prayer of the cup of suffering being taken away from Him granted? Perhaps. But in the midst of the emotional turmoil and suffering He was experiencing, He knew one thing: without His suffering, those who have caused Him harm, suffering, pain and betrayal will not have any means of being reconciled to God. If that was the case, then even people in the past and the future will not have any means of reconciling with God, consigning themselves to eternal damnation in hell. It is in these multiple complicated layers of emotions and stakes that we find the human-God Jesus facing the Sanhedrin. On one hand, He can command His angels to slaughter them, asserting His dominance over humanity. On the other hand, He can stay silent and experience the most gruesome torture humanity can ever inflict on a human being. Even though He did not expect God to grant His wish, He still prayed. That is the hardest thing to do as a Christian; when all hope is lost and all you can do is pray. But this is exactly the next step in our relationship with God: when we pray even though we know that God may not grant our prayer, just because we know that we have to bring everything to Him in prayer, warts and all. That kind of faith will help us weather the suffering and storms of lives, even the betrayal of our closest friends and family, as well as the future of pain and suffering.", "hit_ratio": 0.5132743362831859}, {"doc_text": "Something about the background of the poem.. Historically, Europe has been a theater of strife, battles, and wars. Dukes, kings, and emperors fought wars from the safety of their palaces with no great reason, other than expanding their spheres of influence. Through patriotic propaganda, coercion, and brainwashing, ill-trained and ill-equipped young people were sent to the battlefront. What resulted was death, injury, and deprivation of colossal scale. The pain inflicted on the society was immense, but no one had the courage and sense to stand up and ask why the wars were being fought. Every pain was justified on the altar of patriotism. In this poem, the author launches a scathing attack on such senseless resort to violence and bloodshed for no apparent reason. Small causes that could easily be resorted through diplomacy were blown up to project them as affronts to the national honour. No one thought about the young widows, the orphans, the old parents who lost their dearest ones. The poet passionately underlines the futility of wars and portrays the urge to kill another human being as something totally abhorrent and vulgar. A war was fought there in 1704, where British soldiers fought against the French. The British finally prevailed, but the cost to either side was terrible. Kasper had finished his day\u2019s work, and was basking in the soft sunlight. Wilhelmine was playing nearby. The child\u2019s brother, Peterkin had stumbled upon a large smooth spherical thing while playing near a stream flowing in the vicinity. The boy was curious to know what the object he had brought was. The ploughshare digs our the skulls. He says that many soldiers had laid down their lives in the \u2018great\u2019 war, these are the remains of those valiant men. The two grandchildren, Peterkin and Wilhelmine, the skulls certainly held some dark secrets. They were eager to know from their grandfather, why the people died, and what they fought for. \u2018What was the motivation behind the war, and what purpose it served,\u2019 they begged Kasper to reveal. However, he could not say what triggered the war, and why mayhem in such gigantic scale happened. Stanza 7 .. Kasper recollected the events of the war days at Bleheim. His father\u2019s house beside the stream was reduced to ashes as the enemy rolled in. Men, young and old, women, some of them pregnant, children, all perished. There was death and destruction all around the country. Untold misery and horror ravaged the landscape. But, in the popular perception, it was a \u2018famous victory\u2019. Stanza 9 .. After the guns of the war fell silent, one saw the scale of loss of human lives in the battle field. Countless dead and decaying bodies lay under the sun. There was no one to give the dead men a decent burial. In the next breath, Kasper says that wars such as this always bring massive loss of life and property. It is inevitable. After all, it was a \u2018famous victory\u2019. It was too big a loss to justify the suffering and pain it caused. Stanza 11 .. Kasper narrated how, in the aftermath of the war, everyone praised the Duke for having brought such a great victory. Little Peterkine couldn\u2019t reconcile himself to the stance of his grandpa. He admitted that he didn\u2019t know why the war was fought, but kept repeating that it was a \u2018famous victory\u2019. What is the underlying theme of the poem? Do you feel this poem should be hung in all public place like schools, offices, airports, stations etc. to awaken the citizens about the futility of war? If war is so repugnant to our moral sense, why we have not been able to banish it altogether? Oh,I am so delighted to see your appreciation. Thank you. This is very helpful.

After eating meals, he often feels a burning sensation in his throat, dizziness, and a pain in his chest. After 15 years of marriage, he still loves her and wants to continue their relationship. It is his wife\u2019s business, having inherited it from her father. He is totally dependent on her. She\u2019s the boss. The iron staircase of the title leads from the first floor up directly to their bedroom and the other rooms where they live. Lomel often stands at the top of the staircase listening to what is said downstairs at the shop. He wonders about the men Louise meets there every day\u2014perhaps she is serious about one of them? She was married to her first husband at the time. Etienne came to her shop on business and they soon began an affair. Louise\u2019s callousness is seen when her sister-in-law died: all it meant to her was the chance for a long rendezvous with her lover, Etienne, since her husband had to go away for the funeral. Etienne and Louise agree to marry, but what about her husband? During one of his visits, she tells Etienne that her husband has become seriously ill. After a few weeks, the husband dies. He believes she poisoned her husband, as she might be poisoning him now, to get him out of the way and marry a younger man. Etienne has the same symptoms that her previous husband had immediately before he died: weight loss, tiredness, and heart trouble. For the 15 years of their marriage, he had never asked his wife how her former husband had died. Part II opens with Etienne seeing a doctor and asking if it\u2019s possible to determine if he is the victim of arsenic poisoning. The doctor suggests he is obligated to go to the police but Etienne refuses to give him any information and leaves. Etienne sees her at the post office where she reads a letter that makes her very happy. He waits and after an hour, he sees her leave arm-in-arm with a man. He sees them kiss as they part. He recognizes the man as Roger Cornu, son of a printer in their stationery shop. Even now, knowing everything, Etienne still wants to keep Louise, and to keep living. He realizes he is as much to blame as his wife for the death of her former husband, since he agreed to marry her while she was still with him. Feelings of guilt over the death of the ex-husband often possess him. He wants their relationship to remain as it is, keeping to themselves with their silent secrets. But he is told the name of the restaurant where he usually hangs out. He then goes to a gun shop and buys a revolver. Afterward, Louise will understand, he believes, because he did the same thing she did before. He goes to Cornu\u2019s favorite restaurant and sees him there, writing a letter, probably to Louise. When Cornu arrives, he notices Etienne standing outside, and calls to him. Etienne is surprised Cornu recognizes him so easily, but shouldn\u2019t have, since they are so similar, two steps on a staircase. Simenon masterfully sets up the reader throughout the narrative for the strange, brutal resolution. Etienne hesitates to pull out his gun. Unable to change from the kind of person he is to someone like his wife, he can\u2019t traverse the \u201ciron staircase\u201d that separates them. Cornu, knowing his own guilt, is stunned that Etienne doesn\u2019t pull out a gun and shoot him. Half an hour later, sitting outside, Etienne shoots himself.

Between the friendships, the relationships and the back drop of Paris it transports me to a very happy place that I don\u2019t seem to want to leave or forget. The book is about Anna, a girl from Atlanta, that is forced to go to Paris for her last year of high school. Not knowing the language or anyone at her new school Anna is left alone and missing her best friend Bridgette and her crush that was possibly turning into something more, Toph. She is surrounded by unfamiliar everything and all she wants to do is go back to the safety of Atlanta. And then her next door neighbor Meredith takes her in and introduces her to her friends and the one boy that changes everything, St. Clair. Etienne St. Clair, the boy dreams are made of. All of a sudden France isn\u2019t so bad. Pretty soon Anna has a life in France and friends, Meredith, Josh, Rashmi and St. Clair. And when things start to get complicated at home Anna wants nothing more then to retreat back to the place she had been desperate to escape, back to St. Clair. It is so perfectly crush worthy, adorable that I\u2019m not sure I can give it justice. I mean reading about these two made me crave that feeling you get when you have an honest to God crush.

Every emotion they felt, every conflict of uncertainty that was there I felt too and that made the characters and this couple in particular a work of greatness. And the way that Perkins showed cased Anna\u2019s feelings, towards this boy that had her all over the place, by having Anna call him St. Clair and Etienne was just masterful and the perfect way to describe their ever changing relationship.

While it looks extremely difficult to ink, it's actually made of two basic strokes. Print out four or five of the practice sheets on a nice cardstock or Bristol paper. Practice the basic upward stroke for one or two lines to warm up. You start just above the bottom line. Then you curve down and to the right to touch the bottom line. Next, you shoot up to the top line. Let's take a look at the Cursive Script alphabet. As you can see, it looks almost identical to the cursive you learned in elementary school. The blue arrows above show the directions of the pen strokes and the numbers below tell you how many strokes make up each letter. The letters b, f, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, and z all begin with the downward stroke. Some have strokes that fill up the entire height of the line and others only reach to the dashed line. Some, like the 'f' even reach below the bottom line. To start, I'm going to show you the direction of each stroke plus how many stokes make up each letter. Place your pen tip on the bottom line. Make an upward stroke to the dashed line. Then make a downward stroke that dips to the bottom line and then swings back up again. Next, make another downward stroke and end with a little curl. Repeat making the letter 'u' three times so that you get the feel of it. Many letters, such as the i, j, m, n, r, v, w, and y are very similar to the 'u'. Let's try a harder letter: h. The 'h' starts the same as the 'h' but its stroke reaches all the way up to the top line. You then arc to the left and make a downward stroke to the bottom line. You'll cross over your previous line right near the bottom. Now arc up to the dash line and make a downward stroke back down to the bottom line, curling up at the end. Repeat making the letter 'h' three times so that you get the feel of it. Many letters, such as the b, f, k, and l are very similar to the 'h'. The letters a, c, d, e, g, o, and q all begin with the curved stroke. To start, I'm going to show you the direction of each stroke plus how many stokes make up each letter. Not too hard, was it? Repeat making the letter 'o' three times so that you get the feel of it. Let's try a harder letter: g. Make the same start to the 'g' as you did the 'o' but go up past the starting point. Then make a downward stroke and go past the bottom line. Curl to the left and make an upward, diagonal stroke that goes a bit above the bottom line. It should intersect the downward stroke of your 'g' right at the bottom line. Repeat making the letter 'g' three times so that you get the feel of it. When it comes to uppercase letters, I prefer to pencil mine out beforehand. Since most of the letters begin with a curved stroke, I didn't divide the alphabet into groups. Instead, we'll simply work our way through it, using the guide above to see how many strokes each letter is made of and what direction the strokes go. Then make a downward stroke to the bottom line. Your line will be slanting to the right. When you reach the bottom line, curl up and around. Finally, sweep your line out to the right, making a nice gentle curve. Repeat making the letter 'l' three times so that you get the feel of it. Like I said before, when it comes to uppercase letters, the more flourish, the better so don't be scared to make some big curls and sweeping lines. Once you have the 'l' down, it's easy to see how other uppercase letters like the c, e, g, o, and q are made. Make a downward stroke to the bottom line, arcing slightly to the left and ending in a fancy curl. Make a curved stroke up and around to the left toward the top line. You make a lopsided 'o' in the top half of the writing space. Now make another curved stroke out to the right and down to the bottom line, again ending in a fancy curl. A bit superfluous but not too hard, right? Repeat making the letter 'r' three times so that you get the feel of it. The letter 'r' is very similar to the letters b, d, f, i, j, p, and t. So once you have this one down, you can do the rest! This style of calligraphy is the one most often used for wedding invitations and party announcements. You might also think of Jane Austen when you see it. I hope that you've discovered it's actually quite a simple font to write, despite looking very fancy.

A stroll in the glasshouses of Dublin\u2019s Botanic gardens when the Brunfelsia pauciflora is in flower is certain to draw me back to that time. Although not native to South Africa, it was widely grown there for its strong sweet smell; it was known as yesterday-today-and-tomorrow as its petals began as purple, then lilac and finally faded to white. Mimosa, Acacia dealbata, an Australian native, is widely grown in Mediterranean climates and its delicious scent will always remind me of Spring holidays in southern France or Italy. Its flowers are frequently given to women in Italy, Russia and Georgia on International Women\u2019s Day (March 8th). Here, it can often be found in florist shops in early Spring and fills the house with its sweet scent and cheerful Spring yellow. I can\u2019t resist it. Lavender is also an evocative plant which invariably delights \u2013 the scent of summer, bees humming along lavender hedges, holidays, sunshine on Proven\u00e7al fields. I never fail to plant it in my gardens, always near a bench or by the house, its scent reminds me of happy times, holidays spent long ago with good friends near Aix-en-Provence. It isn\u2019t just places but people which are brought to mind when we catch the scent of something which stops us in our tracks. My late father bought me a flowering shrub for my first garden, a Philadelphus, or mock-orange, with its creamy white very fragrant flowers; its scent will forever be associated with him. It seems that smells enter through the nose to the olfactory bulb, part of the limbic system, the emotional part of our brain; whereas words go into the thinking part of our brains. The scent of boxwood always carries me back to Virginia where I grew up, and the smell of dry earth when rain begins to fall takes me to its hot summer days. Lilac transports me to my first garden, near Toronto, Ontario. Sweetly scented narcissus tell me it is spring, and that I am at my present garden, Glen Villa, in the Eastern Townships of Quebec. So don\u2019t get me started on madeleines! Yes, boxwood, or box as we call it, has a very distinctive scent. I always recall the Victorian garden at Hunter\u2019s Hotel here in Ireland, with its garden of box hedging. Yes, you\u2019re right, lilies such a lovely scent. Love the idea of Easter corsages of lilies. You\u2019ve reminded me of my mother wearing a corsage of orchids when she went out to a special danse. Seeing the \u2018yesterday today and tomorrow\u2019 really takes me back to our last house in Johannesburg. The scent of gardenias reminds me of a bottle of perfume I got as a Christmas present from my aunt when I was fourteen. It was such a surprise, because every year without fail, she would send me a manicure set for my birthday and again at Christmas. \ud83d\ude42 The scent of red roses reminds me of me in my early 20\u2019s when I had a small black and red bottle of \u2018Joy\u2019 perfume, which I eked out for as long as I could, because it was so expensive. A lovely reminder of the beauties of life on earth. When I travel back home, the smell of the grass and trees bring back the childhood memories of hours playing outside until dark.

While not sweet, the lavender in this scent is not a sharp, medicinal lavender. I couldn't pick the teakwood out my itself at first, but as the scent wears, the teakwood comes out more and more until it rivals the strength of lavender in this scent. I never got the cacao note though. Overall, a relatively simple lavender scent and unfortunately, pretty forgettable in my opinion. In the bottle, it's a strange cacophony of cacao, lavender and white musk. Once it's warmed on my skin the cacao disappears and the lavender and musk seem to be a little more in alignment. At dry down, this becomes a predominantly white musk scent with the lavender bringing up the rear. Chocolate dominates here on my skin. Alongside it, I get teak, blackcurrant, and lavender.

They don\u2019t go together like a horse and carriage; they go together like a horse and \u2013 well, a tricycle. Or a pair of rollerskates. But this is a Labradoodle of a fragrance, as it turns out. Or a Cockapoo. You know: those dogs which are created by taking two fairly attractive breeds (for instance, labrador and poodle), and creating something altogether more cute and appealing. (Though not a \u2018dog person\u2019 \u2013 The Scent Critic has plastic bag issues \u2013 I have been known to melt when encountering a Cockapoo on the end of a lead.) Lavender on its own: aromatic, but a touch antiseptic. Great in an ice cream, or a sponge cake, but over-eager use in a fragrance sends it speeding in the direction of ickiness. In \u00fcber-nose Jacques Polge\u2019s hands, at least, somewhat delicious. (And a few \u2018Wow, you smell nice\u2019-es, from friends and colleagues, which always helps.) It\u2019s crisp and clean at the start: I really am trailing my fingers through a lavender bush, which obviously is the effect Polge was going for. Now, classically, lavender is a masculine ingredient. Or a Little Old Lady ingredient (familiar from brushing your lips against a favourite great-aunt\u2019s slightly hirsute cheek, and getting a whiff of her Yardley). But here, the herbal cleanliness mellows in just a few minutes, and Jersey becomes cloud-soft and cashmere-snuggly. In reality it\u2019s intended, I\u2019m sure, to be soft as jersey itself: the fabric which Coco Chanel embraced in the early 1920s, taking it out of the underwear drawer \u2013 it was worn, by chaps, in vest form \u2013 and using it instead to create drape-y clothes which liberated women from whalebone corsetry in one French-seamed bound. Why, the bottle I was sent \u2013 not sure if this is standard issue or Scent Critic privilege \u2013 actually came with its own drawstring jersey pouch. As I fossick around in my scent memories, the fragrance it most reminds me of is the original Tartine et Chocolate (from Givenchy): originally marketed as a children\u2019s scent, because of its subtle delicacy, but loved by grown-ups, and \u2013 just like Jersey \u2013 unfolding to a vanilla warmth, on the skin. (Not that you probably would, at this price, unless you happened to be wedded to a Russian oligarch). Equally, it could be worn by a man, I\u2019d say (though probably not the stevedore type), and would smell tr\u00e8s elegant as he wafted around. It doesn\u2019t hang around for that long, to be totally honest, but I think it\u2019s nice while it does. That might sound like damning with faint praise, but I like both the bold Proven\u00e7ale lavender overture, and the pretty, powdery dry-down.

Rule-breaking is a great Chanel tradition \u2013 why not make frocks out of vest fabric, or be first to try to balance lavender with vanilla? \u2013 and while this may not be the greatest scent creation of the 21st century, and not quite up there alongside Sycomore or 28 La Pausa in the roll-call of Chanel Les Exclusifs triumphs, Jersey deserves a rosette, for trying. This one was not well received elsewhere in perfume blog world but I like it too. Not love, but like, and will probably break out my decant in the spring along with Hermes Brin de Reglisse.However, as much as I enjoyed your review, how about Caron\u2019s Pour un Homme for pairing vanilla and lavender? That is one of my favourite men\u2019s fragrances ever and there is something of it in by Kilian\u2019s Taste of Heaven, also yummy. When I sidled up to the Chanel counter I only gave this latest addition to their line a cursory sniff just from holding the bottle and smelling the atomizer as it was recently spritzed by someone other than myself\u2026 I was mildly bemused it smelled like the laundry Boost powders I regularly use: borax and washing soda. Only less harsh with flowers and slight a slightly sweet scent floating above it. I honestly think I can get the same effect if I put essential oils and artificial vanilla into my rinse water of my laundry cycle I could get the same effect! That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t bother to investigate any further by sprinting it on a card. Loathe the thought of perfume smelling like laundry. Granted, I like it better than the nauseating air freshener CHANCE, the worst offender is the eau version. I love how this is soft and feminine.

Perhaps the only man she ever loved, Sir Robert, was a married man whom the Queen was \u201cforced\u201d to distance herself from.

As a young woman she was famed for her hair, which was very long and unlike Henry's other wives she wore loose the majority of the time. She was apparently plump. Ignore the portraits showing a reddish tinge; this was a popular attribute to add to portraits in the 16th century, as was pale skin. Red hair was considerd very attractive; I don't think she would have insisted on all wearing the gable hood, which covered all the hair, if her hair was one of her best features. CATHERINE HOWARD - we have no portrait that we can be sure is her; the two thought to be her show a woman with blonde-brown hair. She was said to be very short and quite plump. She died as a teenager. Some sources describe her as beautiful, others as average. KATHERINE PARR - Her skeleton, when examined in the 19th century, showed her to be 5'2\" with auburn, curly hair. As to eye colours, I think you'll have to scrutunise the portraits; the ones on Google images weren't clear enough for me to be sure. Also, of course, you can go by the eyebrows in the portraits: Anne of Cleves had dark brown eyebrows, so probably had dark brown hair. Katherine of Aragon had strawberry blonde hair, was of average height, and was slim, until her late 30's. She apparently had moles on her too. She was petite in stature and physique. Not brunette or a redhead. She was slim, and had pale skin and \"mouse\" like features. Anne of Cleves was believed to be a little \"chubby\" compared to Henry's previous wives, one of the reasons he quickly divorced her. She was small and apparently her hair was brunette. She wasn't slim but not chubby either. She was only a slip of a girl when Henry found out she had another lover and had her beheaded. Jane Seymour - Had a receding chin and her hair was almost white blonde. Katherine Howard- Had brown and dark eyes, she was considered (by Henry) as the most beautiful. Catherine Parr- Had Dark brown hair and blue eyes. - This would make sense, since she was concidered a beauty in her youth, and the idea of 'beauty' at the time went along the lines of blue-eyes. She is probably the easiest to spot, since she was fond of the French hood, which made her hair visible at the top. Jane Seymour - Although the only contempory portrait we have of her shows the gable hood being worn, from which we can't see any hair, she was described as being very pale in appearance - either a blonde or light brown hair colour. From what I can see in the same famous painting, her eyes look blue or light brown. Many historians say that one of the reasons Henry was attracted to her was the fact that she looked nothing like Anne Boleyn, so this description makes sense. Most people seem to ashume that she was blonde, due to the yellow/gold headdress she wears in the famous painting of her. Her eyes look brown, from the same painting. Catherine Howard - The portraits done of her picture brown hair and brown eyes. It is not known if she really was the 'Rose without a thorn' as Henry called her, though, since all the descriptions vary from average looking to pretty, but no more. She was very beautiful when she was younger. She was famous for her dark hair and eyes. She apparently had very pale skin, light blue eyes and (white) blonde hair. She was probably a bit prettier than her portrait seems to suggest. \"apparelled in a gown of rich cloth of gold ...her hair hanging down, which was fair, yellow and long\". A note on Katherine Howard's colouring: nobody said she was average - Marillac simply implied that she was not as beautiful as he had been lead to believe. And if she was pretty enough to have been described as \"the rose without a thorn\" and \"the jewel of womanhood\" then we can expect that she fit Tudor ideals of beauty - i.e. she was fair. Her eye colour depends on what portraits you believe are her: I'm leaning towards hazel/dark green, personally, but please don't think that historic fact! That's just my estimation based on the portraits I believe to be her, predominantly the miniature. As for her skin, it's been reported that she was like her cousin, with olive skin, and it's also been said that she was pale: it is most likely that if she was \"the rose without a thorn\" she'd be pale, but perhaps she was not as fair as the Tudor age liked: after all, Marillac wasn't as impressed with her appearance as he expected to be. So, really, it's impossible to tell. Being around a size 8-12 was prized, pale skin, golden-reddish hair (considered the color of royalty at the time), and blue eyes, and small mouths were considered beautiful. Jane is my fave , her hair colour was medium-light blonde , I've got that hair colour , her hair WAS NOT brown or red!!! And actually Anne hair color is never described, she probably had red hair though, given the earliest known portraits of her (The Elizabeth I ring and the Holbein Sketch) both have her with red hair. Anne's only ever described as having dark skin and eyes, her hair color is never mentioned. These are all just guesses from the portrait and the TV show the Tudors. Catherine of Aragon: She probably had strawberry blonde hair if you look at the portraits, as for eyes, they were probably blue or hazel. Her gable hood covers her hair in her portraits and you can't really make out Jane's eye color. But if I had to guess, she probably had blonde or red hair (or something in between), and blue or hazel eyes. If you look at her portrait, she had brown eyes, but then, we have this strange anomaly. She could have brown hair because of eyebrows, but, it's pretty weak because of my best friend's has brown eyebrows, but she has blonde hair. Catherine Parr: Probably the second most easy one to determine (after Anne Boleyn) A hair sample taken from her corpse shows she had blonde hair (could be strawberry blonde, sense the hair sample has faded) and brown eyes. In same fashion (except for Anne Boleyn) pale. P.S. Catherine Howard she is considered to be the prettiest out of all king Henry's wives she has medium brown hair and brown eye's. There is an amazing wealth of info found in books by historians....go to Amazon or eBay and such books don't cost that much should you want to start a collection (I love mine!). Or, heck, visit the library. They hired her when she was her natural blonde color and had expected that she would play Anne as a blonde.

Now over the years of having 3 boys I have come to better understand why he feels this way sometimes, Jesse as the baby receives more attention in the manner that he cannot do the things that they can due to age, and Loghan has always required extra attention due to him being on the spectrum and needing it, whereas Gabriel has always been the type of child who is happy to get lost in his own world and play on his own, up until the last year I would say that has always been his happy place and thus it became easy to leave him be and allow him the space and solitude we believed he was happy to have and now I often find myself wondering if that was the right thing to do, one thing I never thought he would do though is question our love for him in comparison to his brothers and it hurt, it really hurt, I can handle the \u201cyou are ruining my life\u201d rants when I say no to something their friends have and the \u201cI don\u2019t like you right now\u2019s\u201d again when I do not give into a request or demand, but it really hurt to hear him say that we love his brothers more than him because it is so incredibly far from the truth.

Cloaked in robes of reeds and scales, six women circled a small pedestal at the center of the group. The eldest of the village took the wrapped child from its mother and shuffled back to the circle. Then, with the silence of stars, the elder placed the bundled child on the stone marker, ready to start the Illumination. To begin, the child must be asleep, secure in its infant mind that all is well. The eldest of the tribe\u2014a bony woman who had forsaken her name long ago for the title of Celestaon, speaker to the stars, led the ceremony. She unwrapped the babe in a smooth motion, as she did for all children. She spoke the names of the Seven Celestial Chiefs, the great beings that hold the dark at bay. The parents kneeled in anxiety, knowing their hopes for the child were not their own, now. Both parents had been deemed merchants, to trade with other clans and even the people beyond the land of Misten. Their fate, much like their child\u2019s, was decided during their own Illumination. Finally, the prayers ended, and chants began as the Eldest placed her hand upon the chest of the baby. She felt its warmth and the flutter of its heart beneath her wrinkled palm. With the subtlest of senses, she focused her Reach, the limit of her magic\u2019s influence, at the center of the child\u2019s chest.

After the elders huddled around the child, they called for the Star Chart to find the closest constellation match to the speckles of stain. As the anticipation grew, no answer came. In quick movements, Celestaon grabbed up the baby as the other elders pushed a path through the crowd. The moment of wondering bought her time to escape the questioning and get to her home. As she reached the edge of the steps, she prepared to run across the waterway. As her bare foot was about to strike the surface, she stretched out with her Reach and pushed the heat out from the surface and below\u2014a process so second nature that it took little thought at her age. This anomaly needed thought, and she feared the direction of impulsive Constalari leaders. Celestaon\u2019s home was close now, a place few would invade out of the respect her role demanded. She finally reached the set of steps to her home and turned to see a couple of elders escorting the parents by canoe. She pushed through the door and into her home, the scent of herbs welcoming her. The gentle stirrings of her guest pulled her from relaxing, and she absentmindedly rocked the child. Celestaon sat at a table as the door opened. In shuffled the parents and the elder for the Merchant Constalari. The arguing of the clan trailed in behind them. \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d the mother asked, worry etched in her words and on the father\u2019s face. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d the father asked, wrapping his arm around his wife. The other elder had the same quizzical look; she had never heard of such a thing before. She stepped over to Celestaon\u2019s chair and looked down at the child, now awake. They had named her Aliene, and she was squirming with her eyes darting around, unable to focus on any one thing. Celestaon unwrapped the child, showing them the markings that formed a faint eight-pointed star. Aliene had no marks like the rest, and her position could not be determined with such a showing. To followers of the seven celestial chiefs, she may as well not be of the Misten clans. \u201cWe will most likely have to exile this child; she will be cast into the other lands of Savea.\u201d Celestaon knew her odds.

Part of the excitement over the royal birth was that, for the first time, boy or girl, the child would become a future monarch. The Succession to the Crown Act, which received royal assent on 25 April 2013, changes this. As it turns out, haste was unnecessary and the baby born yesterday afternoon was a boy, but for his own daughters or granddaughters, the change will be significant. Just under 172 years ago, there was a birth as highly anticipated as the current royal baby. Queen Victoria\u2019s eldest child was born three weeks early on 21 November 1840, after a twelve hour labour, at which her husband, Prince Albert, was present. I shall have nothing more to do with it, take the child away and do as you like and if she dies you will have it on your conscience.\" Albert undertook her early education himself, ensuring that she was fluent in English, French and German by the age of three. She far outstripped her brother, Bertie (the future Edward VII), who supplanted her as heir to the throne with his birth on 9 November 1841. In fact, Victoria was disappointed after the birth, declaring \"never mind, the next will be a Prince\". If she had known the character of her eldest son, whom she disliked, would she have changed her mind? Victoria and Vicky had a complicated relationship thanks to Albert\u2019s favouritism, with the queen jealous of having to share her husband\u2019s affections. Victoria did admit that her eldest daughter was \"so clever (I may say wonderfully so), and so sensible\" \u2013 an indication that she might have found her a more fitting heir. If she had been Princess of Wales, Vicky would not have enjoyed the personal happiness that she found in her life when, at fifteen, she fell in love with Frederick \u2018Fritz\u2019, Crown Prince of Prussia. As heir to the throne, Vicky would never have been permitted to wed Fritz, with her marriage, in January 1858, requiring her to live in Germany. In 1888 she became Empress of Germany, although her husband, who was already ill with throat cancer, survived his accession by only 99 days. It was the thought that Vicky would become an empress and outrank her which prompted Victoria to seek her own Imperial title \u2013 that of Empress of India. After Albert\u2019s death she always wore black and relied heavily on her youngest daughter, Beatrice, refusing to allow her to marry until she had promised to continue to live with her. Vicky\u2019s relationship with her mother improved with separation. In particular, the queen urged her daughter to avoid the frequent pregnancies that she had endured in her marriage. In spite of this, Vicky bore eight children, with her eldest, the future Kaiser Wilhelm II, born on 27 January 1859. Queen Victoria II would have had a brief reign. She was already suffering from breast cancer when her mother died on 22 January 1901, after a reign of more than 63 years.

Jack is a writer, multi-instrumentalist, and volunteer educator. Jane Chapman was the youngest of three children; she had two older brothers, Christian, and Benjamin. Jane\u2019s mother, Anna, died while giving birth to her, and Jane\u2019s father, Robert, was devastated. This was the time of the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression. Times were challenging in many areas of the country, but Jane and her family managed to live a relatively plentiful, if not fairly reclusive, existence on their farm in the Midwestern U.S. Overall, the Chapman farm was not vast, but they had a fair sized chicken coop, some cows, pigs, and the like. The family also maintained an ample garden; they grew asparagus, Carolina cucumbers for pickling, potatoes, and a variety of other produce to sell and consume. Jane\u2019s brothers rarely left the family farm, except when they needed to fetch a few supplies and could not wait on Mr. Camdon to make his regular delivery from town. Mr. Chapman never left the farm, and he rarely helped with the chores. Instead, Mr. Chapman elected to spend most of his time sitting on the front porch silently smoking his pipe, or on a recurrent basis, laid up in the house all day after a night of too much shine and ruminating on Anna. When these instances occurred, Jane could usually be found sleeping up in the hayloft in the barn. Understandably, young Jane wished to avoid the ire of her father, which her brothers did little to waylay. Not that they did not want to, but over the years Mr. Chapman had devolved into a bit of a ferine creature; he was not easily handled once he was set\u2014either physically or emotionally. Jane, come what may, still had love in her heart for her father, though, and did what she needed to in order to take care of him. He never quite viewed Jane in the way that most fathers view their young daughters, but instead he increasingly beheld her as one of the primary sources of his inner turmoil, anger, and sadness. After the birth of their second child, Benjamin, Anna was not supposed to be able to have any more children\u2014there had been complications\u2014so Anna\u2019s pregnancy with Jane had been quite a surprise. The occurrence was celebrated as a blessing. As Jane grew older, her father's despondency increased in proportion to his drinking, and the drinking had increased a great deal year over year. If it had not been for her brothers taking up the lion\u2019s share of the work on the farm, and hiring on a couple of hands who had migrated from North Dakota, Jane was sure that her father would have eventually let the farm go to seed, and drowned in shine while it happened. Jane was expected to perform the duties of a wife and a daughter on the farm. This meant that Jane was, on a daily basis: cooking, cleaning, tending the garden, collecting eggs from the coop, and sometimes even mucking out the stalls. Jane\u2019s duties also included going into town to make deliveries and sell eggs and produce. This was her favorite activity, especially when she got to visit Mr. Camdon\u2019s store. Everyone in town knew Jane\u2019s story, and about her father, but most of the time folks just kept their mouths shut concerning the whole affair. Junior worried a great deal about Jane, and he had in mind that he was going to marry Jane and take her far away from that farm. Mr. Camdon had gotten wind of this, he warned Junior, \u201cNow, boy, you best stay away from Jane and anything to do with that Chapman family. Junior was a year older than Jane, wanted to make his own way, and had no desire to take up the running of his father\u2019s store. Over the course of six or seven visits after the spring harvest that year, Junior not only declared his love for Jane but also began trying to convince her to run away with him. Jane, who liked Junior a great deal, dismissed the suggestion, still feeling a strong obligation, almost a debt, to her father and brothers. After a time, Jane took less joy in her visits into town and even began avoiding the Camdon\u2019s store, when she could. In a vain effort to avoid detection, Jane would wear her bonnet and keep her head down when passing nearby. Then, during one particular visit into town, one in which Jane kept her head a little lower and her bonnet pulled a little further forward in order to hide a still healing bruise, Junior, in his diligence, spotted her and hurriedly went out to speak with her. Junior made a good argument, and everything seemed well enough planned out to Jane. With the still tender bruise under Jane\u2019s eye, and with what Junior had said about her mother, Jane finally acquiesced. That night, after Jane believed that everyone was asleep, she packed a small rucksack with some clothes and a few dollars that she had been hoarding. Jane quietly exited the house and crept to the edge of the porch stairs; she stopped and stood for a moment. Jane looked out, for what she believed would be one last time, over the moonlit lawn and the meadow just beyond. Unexpectedly, Jane heard a noise from the far side of the porch in the shadows, and grasped that she was not alone. \"Where you think you're goin', girl,\" Christian said in a light whisper, as he sat hidden from the moonlight on the porch swing. Of course, as the saying goes: Speak of the wolf and the wolf is at the door. \u201cWhat in the hell\u2019s goin\u2019 on out here, sound like a buncha mice havin\u2019 church!\u201d Mr. Chapman said, his words a touch slurred, flinging open the door and stumbling halfway out onto the porch. Christian, withdrawing from the shadows, leveled the gun and slowly began to approach his father. Mr. Chapman, now at the edge of the stairs, seemed fixated on the image of his daughter making her way from the house with Junior. Christian continued to advance, but in his inexperience he drew too near, and in an instant his father had turned and lunged for the gun, a struggle began. As Jane and Junior were running hand in hand, less than fifty or so yards from the house, Jane heard the 12 gauge go off once, and then twice. On the second shot, she was violently pulled backward as if suddenly anchored to the ground. As Jane gained her senses and rolled over, she saw Junior lying chest down in the grass, head to the side, his eyes glazed, and his jaw slack. She looked up to the porch and saw the giant silhouette of her father alone in the moonlight with the shotgun. Jane then saw a great flash, heard the 520 tear through the night one last time, and saw her father\u2019s figure crumble and spill down the porch stairs. Jane, a scream caught in her throat, in a delirium, tried to run back to the house, making it just over halfway before collapsing. For what seemed like an eternity, Jane stood in the moonlight and gazed absently out beyond the endless meadow to where she imagined the truck was sitting, waiting to take its passengers to their new life.", "hit_ratio": 1.991150442477876}, {"doc_text": "She was flattered to receive the attention of an \u201colder\u201d man.

I\u2019m convinced that Jane loved her husband and he loved Jane \u2013 the best he could. But, without God, he could not truly cover his wife and love her patiently, kindly and unselfishly. In time, they moved far away from her parents, friends, and church family. It was too easy to remain anonymous and, thus, accountable to no one. When Jane gave birth to their first child, she wanted to be the kind of mom her mother was. But, she failed to trust that God would help her in that vocation.

Plus you can also still use a 40% off coupon on top of the educator discount. This DVD takes students step-by-step through the process of creating a beautiful, colorful fish on bristol paper using colored pencils. The materials for this lesson include bristol paper and colored pencils (scarlet lake, white, black, yellow, photo blue, indigo blue). Gwyn did fabulous with this project and needed no help. She loved adding her own special touches to her masterpiece like the seaweed and swishing fish tail. The materials for this lesson include a canvas 11\"x14\", brushes (several sizes) and acrylic paint (black, cadmium yellow, cadmium red, blue and white). Gwyn practiced on a sheet of paper a few times before she did her final project on the canvas (she is quite the perfectionist). And she of course added her own details, like the flying birds. We did find acrylic paint a little more difficult to work with, but the end result was beautiful. It really is quite amazing how the textured wrinkles really bring the sculpture to life and make it look like a real turtle. The materials for this lesson include 2 lbs of self hardening clay, sealer spray, kroma crackle and acrylic paint (raw sienna veridian and black). This project spanned over a few days because you must allow time for drying of the clay, paint, crackle and sealer. Gwyn learned all about shade variations, blending, the color wheel, color theory, etc. We also even dug a little deeper and explored where names like ultramarine, cadmium come from, this website was very helpful. However when he sees the masterpieces his big sister creates he gets a little more intrigued each time and wants to give it a try.

Where it came from, I cannot say. Perhaps from a short movie clip watched between forty winks. Or a figment thrown up my the imagination, on reading a piece of writing somewhere. It makes me want to go to places with exotic names like Istanbul and Samoa and Casablanca.

The gentleman with the uncombed head appeared quite satisfied with this mute announcement of their business, and, producing a flat stone bottle, which might hold about a couple of quarts, from beneath his bedstead, filled out three glasses of gin, which Job Trotter and Sam disposed of in a most workmanlike manner. No more, replied Job Trotter. Mr. Pickwick paid, the door was unbolted, and out they came; the uncombed gentleman bestowing a friendly nod upon Mr. Roker, who happened to be passing at the moment. From this spot, Mr. Pickwick wandered along all the galleries, up and down all the staircases, and once again round the whole area of the yard. The great body of the prison population appeared to be Mivins, and Smangle, and the parson, and the butcher, and the leg, over and over, and over again. There were the same squalor, the same turmoil and noise, the same general characteristics, in every corner; in the best and the worst alike. The whole place seemed restless and troubled; and the people were crowding and flitting to and fro, like the shadows in an uneasy dream. I have seen enough, said Mr. Pickwick, as he threw himself into a chair in his little apartment. Henceforth I will be a prisoner in my own room. And Mr. Pickwick steadfastly adhered to this determination. For three long months he remained shut up, all day; only stealing out at night to breathe the air, when the greater part of his fellow-prisoners were in bed or carousing in their rooms. His health was beginning to suffer from the closeness of the confinement, but neither the often-repeated entreaties of Perker and his friends, nor the still more frequently-repeated warnings and admonitions of Mr. Samuel Weller, could induce him to alter one jot of his inflexible resolution.", "hit_ratio": 0.8717948717948718}, {"doc_text": "Mr. Pickwick's apartments in Goswell Street, although on a limited scale, were not only of a very neat and comfortable description, but peculiarly adapted for the residence of a man of his genius and observation. His sitting-room was the first-floor front, his bedroom the second-floor front; and thus, whether he were sitting at his desk in his parlour, or standing before the dressing- glass in his dormitory, he had an equal opportunity of contemplating human nature in all the numerous phases it exhibits, in that not more populous than popular thoroughfare. His landlady, Mrs. Bardell-- the relict and sole executrix of a deceased custom-house officer--was a comely woman of bustling manners and agreeable appearance, with a natural genius for cooking, improved by study and long practice, into an exquisite talent. There were no children, no servants, no fowls. The only other inmates of the house were a large man and a small boy; the first a lodger, the second a production of Mrs. Bardell's. The large man was always home precisely at ten o'clock at night, at which hour he regularly condensed himself into the limits of a dwarfish French bedstead in the back parlour; and the infantine sports and gymnastic exercises of Master Bardell were exclusively confined to the neighbouring pavements and gutters. Cleanliness and quiet reigned throughout the house; and in it Mr. Pickwick's will was law. To any one acquainted with these points of the domestic economy of the establishment, and conversant with the admirable regulation of Mr. Pickwick's mind, his appearance and behaviour on the morning previous to that which had been fixed upon for the journey to Eatanswill would have been most mysterious and unaccountable. He paced the room to and fro with hurried steps, popped his head out of the window at intervals of about three minutes each, constantly referred to his watch, and exhibited many other manifestations of impatience very unusual with him. It was evident that something of great importance was in contemplation, but what that something was, not even Mrs. Bardell had been enabled to discover. 'Mrs. Bardell,' said Mr. Pickwick, at last, as that amiable female approached the termination of a prolonged dusting of the apartment. 'Why it's a good long way to the Borough, sir,' remonstrated Mrs. Bardell. 'Ah,' said Mr. Pickwick, 'very true; so it is.' Mr. Pickwick relapsed into silence, and Mrs. Bardell resumed her dusting. 'That depends,' said Mrs. Bardell, approaching the duster very near to Mr. Pickwick's elbow which was planted on the table. 'La, Mr. Pickwick,' said Mrs. Bardell, the crimson rising to her cap-border again. Mrs. Bardell could only reply by a look. She had long worshipped Mr. Pickwick at a distance, but here she was, all at once, raised to a pinnacle to which her wildest and most extravagant hopes had never dared to aspire. Mr. Pickwick was going to propose--a deliberate plan, too--sent her little boy to the Borough, to get him out of the way--how thoughtful--how considerate! 'He, too, will have a companion,' resumed Mr. Pickwick, 'a lively one, who'll teach him, I'll be bound, more tricks in a week than he would ever learn in a year.' And Mr. Pickwick smiled placidly. 'Mercy upon me,' said Mr. Pickwick, struggling violently, 'I hear somebody coming up the stairs. Don't, don't, there's a good creature, don't.' But entreaty and remonstrance were alike unavailing; for Mrs. Bardell had fainted in Mr. Pickwick's arms; and before he could gain time to deposit her on a chair, Master Bardell entered the room, ushering in Mr. Tupman, Mr. Winkle, and Mr. Snodgrass. Mr. Pickwick was struck motionless and speechless. He stood with his lovely burden in his arms, gazing vacantly on the countenances of his friends, without the slightest attempt at recognition or explanation. They, in their turn, stared at him; and Master Bardell, in his turn, stared at everybody. The astonishment of the Pickwickians was so absorbing, and the perplexity of Mr. Pickwick was so extreme, that they might have remained in exactly the same relative situations until the suspended animation of the lady was restored, had it not been for a most beautiful and touching expression of filial affection on the part of her youthful son. Clad in a tight suit of corduroy, spangled with brass buttons of a very considerable size, he at first stood at the door astounded and uncertain; but by degrees, the impression that his mother must have suffered some personal damage pervaded his partially developed mind, and considering Mr. Pickwick as the aggressor, he set up an appalling and semi- earthly kind of howling, and butting forward with his head, commenced assailing that immortal gentleman about the back and legs, with such blows and pinches as the strength of his arm, and the violence of his excitement, allowed. 'Thank you, sir--thank you;' exclaimed Mrs. Bardell hysterically. And downstairs she was led accordingly, accompanied by her affectionate son. 'Placed me in such an extremely awkward situation,' continued Mr. Pickwick. 'Very,' was the reply of his followers, as they coughed slightly, and looked dubiously at each other. This behaviour was not lost upon Mr. Pickwick. He remarked their incredulity. They evidently suspected him. Mr. Snodgrass did as he was desired; and Mr. Samuel Weller forthwith presented himself. 'I should think so,' replied Sam, with a patronising wink. 'Thank'ee, sir,' said Sam. And down he sat without further bidding, having previously deposited his old white hat on the landing outside the door. ''Tain't a wery good 'un to look at,' said Sam, 'but it's an astonishin' 'un to wear; and afore the brim went, it was a wery handsome tile. Hows'ever it's lighter without it, that's one thing, and every hole lets in some air, that's another --wentilation gossamer I calls it.' On the delivery of this sentiment, Mr. Weller smiled agreeably upon the assembled Pickwickians. 'You accept the situation?' inquired Mr. Pickwick. With the single exception of one amiable indiscretion, in which an assistant housemaid had equally participated, the history of Mr. Weller's conduct was so very blameless, that Mr. Pickwick felt fully justified in closing the engagement that very evening. With the promptness and energy which characterised not only the public proceedings, but all the private actions of this extraordinary man, he at once led his new attendant to one of those convenient emporiums where gentlemen's new and second- hand clothes are provided, and the troublesome and inconvenient formality of measurement dispensed with; and before night had closed in, Mr. Weller was furnished with a grey coat with the P. C. button, a black hat with a cockade to it, a pink striped waistcoat, light breeches and gaiters, and a variety of other necessaries, too numerous to recapitulate.", "hit_ratio": 3.111111111111111}, {"doc_text": "In many places the walls seemed to remain standing, holding up the ceiling by the power of some dark entity\ufffds will alone.

Janai was sitting by the window, her beautiful red hair tumbled loosely along the cold, hard floor of the room, her lace nightgown hung loosely around her body. Lina slowly crept out of bed, as not to wake the slumbering Princess, and over to the window where Janai sat, locked in a dreamy daze out into the moonlit plains below. \ufffdWhat are you doing awake, Janai?\ufffd Lina asked in a sleepy whisper. \ufffdI couldn\ufffdt sleep.

The birds began to chirp their morning songs of happiness, and the air was fresh with the scent of morning dew. The suns rays warmed Lina\ufffds face as she slowly opened her eyes, the sounds of the birds filling the room, the bright sun light warming her gentle skin. She was nearly done when she heard her roommate, Amelia, wake. Say, where is Miss Janai?\ufffd Her voice seemed to be even perkier in the sunlit morning. \ufffdMaybe so. Well let\ufffds go down and check Miss Lina!\ufffd Lina and Amelia exited their peaceful room and proceeded down the narrow hallway to the stairs. It was much darker in the hallway, because there were no windows to let in the sunlight. They proceeded down the stairs and to the lobby of the Inn. Sure enough, Janai was sitting with Zelgadis at a table in the diner. \ufffdThere\ufffds Miss Janai and Mr. Zelgadis!\ufffd Amelia said, waving to them and prancing over to the table. Lina walked slowly over, pretending as if she had nothing to do with the Prancing Princess of Perk. Janai and Zelgadis looked up from their conversation and Janai smiled and waved back to the princess. \ufffdGood morning Lina.\ufffd Janai said, smiling warmly. \ufffdMost likely sleeping in the heap where I left him.\ufffd Janai snickered. The diner was small, but sufficient. It was drawn with many windows and amber decor. \ufffdGreat idea!\ufffd Amelia\ufffds perk was a little too much then any of them could handle, especially early in the morning. There was the slow trudge of footsteps down the stairs, as they turned to see Gourry walking limply down the stairs, his golden hair a mess, drawn partially over one eye. They walked down the dirt path on the outside of town. On either side were trees, flowers, and plants of every kind and color. The birds were singing as they hunted for food for their young and the bright sun was melting the last bit of dew off the leaves. Lina looked up to the sun, shielding her eyes from its glare, and watched an eagle soar overhead. Everything was so alive, so pretty, like in a picture. A pair of majestic violet eyes watched the group from the shadows as they proceeded on, the sounds of their conversation ringing through the peaceful trees. \ufffdWhat\ufffds wrong Janai?\ufffd Zelgadis could think of nothing more then to examine the beauty in front of him, especially that of his new mysterious companion. She was so enchanting, everything about her was like the pictures in a fairy tale, he wanted to know as much as he could about her mysterious life, and unlock it at for his own. The dark eyes from the brush snickered and whispered to itself, \ufffdSoon, very soon\ufffd\ufffd Zelgadis looked around, his demon ears had picked up the sounds of the voice, but couldn\ufffdt understand it. All he could hear was the haunting echoes of darkness. The bright sun shimmered against the leaves of the trees. \ufffdWhich way should we go?\ufffd Lina looked down each path as far as she could. He looked up toward the group, his handsome face being blinded by the light of the morning sun. That way is the way you wish to take, and someday, we shall cross paths again, Lina Inverse.\ufffd Kaitou\ufffds voice echoed slowly away as her and her brother disappeared before their eyes. \ufffdWell that was just\ufffdodd.\ufffd Lina staggered with her words, and proceeded to walk down the middle path. I can sense it.\ufffd The others followed Lina down the path, discussing their encounter with the strange twins along the way. The birds had begun to chirp again, and all returned to as it should be, the gentle pools of water, reflecting the suns glow and warming the air around it. The sky turned orange and red as the bright yellow sun moved further and further down into the horizon. The path was covered in an eerie glow, the fires of the sky raining down upon it. The sunset flourished through the windows, casting shades of fire across the quiet room. A dark figure lurking in the shadows came to a halt. It\ufffds face dimmed in the fiery shadows as the sun blazed across the horizon. Within the blink of an eye, the figure vanished in a ribbon of dark clouds. Xellos Metallium sat in his lair, the small light of the chandelier casting flickering shadows across the room. His lavender eyes, alive with mischief, gazing upon the wilted pages of a book. \ufffdOh what fun I\ufffdm going to have!\ufffd He snickered happily to himself as he looked up from his book, then turned his attention back to it. His voice was overcome with darkness as he recited the chartings in the book aloud. A wave of his hand and a mess of fire and darkness spread across the room then slowly faded away, and there were shadows once more. Xellos grinned happily and vanished without a trace. \ufffdSo, what do you think these \ufffdMysterious Twins\ufffd, want?\ufffd Zelgadis stared into his cup of tea, not even looking up as he spoke. The sun had set, and the restaurant was lit by the flickering of candles and chandeliers. The bleak silhouetted outlines of people framed the walls, dancing in an eerie, darkened pattern. \ufffdNo clue. But I think that they mean trouble.\ufffd Lina leaned back in her chair, as she often did when she was talking. \ufffdThis isn\ufffdt the time to get into that.\ufffd Zelgadis interrupted, looking up from his tea. Janai sat to his right, holding her cup with both hands and gazing down into its liquid contents. \ufffdAnyway, I think it would be best if we all got some rest, and discussed it in the morning, ne?\ufffd Janai\ufffds voice was sweet and rhythmic. He wanted to study every aspect of her and enjoy her beauty. \ufffdThat\ufffds a good idea, Miss Janai.\ufffd Amelia slowly got up from her chair and went in the direction of the inn. They all got up and followed her, but Zelgadis couldn\ufffdt stand it any longer. She turned her gaze around at him, and her eyes seemed more beautiful then ever before. He loved the way her silken red hair framed her delicate face, and her eyes, so full of pain, so full of beauty gazed compassionately at everything around her. For some reason, he had the courage that had never been there before, like a sweet magic spell wanting him to be closer to her, feeling her touch, meeting her every gaze. She could feel something special about that night, the auras of angels gleaming, singing their sweet rhapsodies of love. She loved how the sound of her name flowed of his tongue in his deep, soothing voice. She gazed back into his eyes, studying every single magnificent detail of his face. She gently squeezed his hands, they were so warm, she\ufffdd expected them to be cold as stone. \ufffdYes Zelgadis?\ufffd Her voice filled the emptiness of the alley, bouncing from wall to wall until it muted into the flesh and stone. They stood, in hushed silence, as she slowly moved closer too him, and he wrapped his arms around her and pulled her close, holding her tight. \ufffdI know\ufffd\ufffd He held her close, she could feel his warmth, he could smell her beautiful aroma. He raised a hand and ran it through the back of her hair; it was soft as finest silk, so gentle against his skin.

Naoki's eyes wandered across the living room, looking to see whether or not he was alone. He noticed few people, some were talking, some were not. His gaze followed down to the quick movement of the boy's fingers, he looked almost impatient. That would be strange in a place like this. Swallowing down what little embarrassment stayed, the demifiend approached the sofa, his eyes fixed on the teenager's ahoge once again. \"Yo.\" he greeted, his soft and quiet voice not matching with his informal way of speaking. \"Simple. 'Cause they taste good and I hate wasting food,\" Kyoko responded stubbornly. Sighing at Flandre's petulant actions, the Puella Magi searched for the bubblegum, and dropped it into vampire's small hands. Naegi's blush had died down to a light red tint on his cheeks, Naoki's voice taking him off guard. Flinching, his eyes darted up to the demifiend, recognizing him as the person who blinked in shirtless. \"...H-hey,\" Naegi said, voice dropping to a mutter. Geez, this sure was awkward for him. He noticed Naoki was staring at his hair, furrowing his eyebrows in perplexion. \"Is there... something wrong?\" Yeah, his hair was messy, but no one really... stared at it like that. Ah, the wonderful life of being an anime protag. Noctin blinked in sitting on the ground nodding slightly. Naoki wondered if it was possible for that hair to stab someone. He blinked his eyes in confusion at the question. \"Not at all.\" he replied. He would even say that the other looked nervous. It took him a moment to realise he was caught staring at the boy's hair. Being around rogue demons everyday must be taking a toll on the demifiend's manners. He quickly changed his gaze to the teenager's eyes. He was feeling embarrassed again, although his face remained most expressionless. he said, shaking his head. A blue dragon blinked into the house. He was half asleep, relaxing on his belly with his eyes half closed. As new scents begun to immediately surround him, his eyes shot open and he quickly got to his feet. He took a few steps forward and started to look around. There weren't many people here, he looked at every face in the living room, hoping to see any signs of grey fur or an eyepatch. Where was his mother? He was beginning to think think she wasn't in the room with him. His heart began to pound and panic clawed at his chest. The young dragon was unsure who any of these people were, were they enemies? Sounds of distress reached Noctin, making him look around for the source. His worry was quelled slightly as his gaze landed on a blue dragon that was taller than he was. That... was a little daunting. Still, the creature didn't look particularly dangerous. Just scared. Which made him potentially dangerous. Working up his courage, Noctin began to approach the dragon slowly, one hand stretched out to it. \"Hello,\" he said quietly, praying to every spirit that the dragon wouldn't breathe fire at him or crush him. \"It's alright, you're safe here, don't worry.\" He was doing his best to sound soothing, something he was rather new at. Though reassuring a child that everything was alright was much different than reassuring a massive frightened dragon that everything was alright. Matteo blinked into the House, rubbing the tears from his eyes and frowning. The little boy slowly stood up and began heading over toward the couch. He slumped down in the couch and buried his face in a pillow. \"If you say so...\" Naegi sighed through his nose, deciding to leave the topic of witnessing Naoki's bare chest for fading away in his memories. I was just worried that something was wrong...\" This guy really doesn't like to let his emotions show through, huh... Although, it's just been a few minutes. Maybe I shouldn't be so quick to judge... \"I'm Makoto Naegi, Super High School Level Good Luck. He extended his hand, beaming at the demifiend with a bright grin. Hyacindiemo's panicked gaze stopped at an approaching boy and stared at his hand. The trembling dragon stretched out his neck, pointing his sensitive nose to the extended hand, and sniffed. He immediately closed his eyes and flinched. He opened his eyes again, unsure of what to think of the boy. He had an animal's scent vaguely on him, but doesn't look semitheian...but didn't smell Theian either. There was distress in his eyes, he just wanted to go home. Naoki shrugged. Was it just him staring at the spiky piece of hair that made him like that? To demons it was impressive, but to normal people? \"Nice meetin' you too.\" He reached his hand out and firmly grasped Naegi's, shaking it in greeting. He tried to think back to the time when schools existed in his world, but he couldn't remember any type being called a super school. Maybe it was a private school? That might have been it. Noctin froze for a second as the dragon's gaze landed on him. Swallowing nervously, he continued forward until the dragon could sniff his hand. He could feel the warm air blowing out onto his hand as the dragon breathed out. Noctin's other hand twitched, and it was all he could do to stop himself from rubbing his dagger anxiously lest it be seen as a threat. He flinched away slightly as the dragon did, then forced himself to slowly lower his hand. \"My name is Noctin,\" he said, still speaking quietly. Sometimes it takes us away from our homes for a bit to come here, but it always returns us back. Pushing his thoughts to the side for now, he decided to focus on the conversation at hand. Naegi blinked his pale eyes curiously, a small smile on his lips. \"It's a school for the people who are at the top of the top for their talents. Like the girl who's a popular idol was accepted, so they call her the Super High School Level Idol. And, well, me...?\" Hyacindiemo has never heard a name like that before. The young dragon looked at him, tilting his head a little. Paradox? He didn't quite understand, but his confusion immediately turned to relief as his eyes widened - he could go home soon? He's only been away from his mother for a few minutes, and he already misses her dearly. What would he even do while he's here? He blinked his eyes at Noctin, the dragon took a few steps forward and sniffed his face; his curious wide eyes scanning his features. At least he didn't seem harmful, so he took three quick lick on the cheek as thanks. He quietly listened to Naegi's explanation of the school. What a strange-sounding academy, something like that was definitely not in his world. \"Well, yeah, I guess so...\" Naegi nodded at Naoki's 'private school' remark, looking thoughtful. \"It's a pretty well-known school, too, so graduating from there pretty much guaruntees success in the long run. I'm pretty sure it teaches the things normal schools would, though...\"\nNoctin relaxed as soon as he saw the panic leave the dragon's gaze. He was grateful that he had managed it without much trouble. Nothing had been crushed and nothing had been set on fire. He did a slight double take as the dragon began to approach him. The dragon looked friendly, but given how much bigger he was, Noctin was a little intimidated. He shut his eyes slightly and stood stiffly as Hyac sniffed his face. The licks were unexpected and brought a surprised laugh from him. \"Alright, alright,\" he said, smiling at the dragon. They did seem to glow more often whenever there was a lack of light. The demifiend suddenly noticed that it was starting to get uncomfortably warm under his coat, but it really wouldn't be a good idea to take it here. If he were back in what was left of Tokyo, sure, but here? He decided to simply roll up the sleeves of his coat as far as he could. Hyacindiemo wanting to continue licking Noctin, heck, he was almost tempted on taking a bite out of him. Maybe transforming would help, his instincts weren't nearly as strong when he was a semitheian after all. He exhaled quickly and sharply as he took a step or two back. He shook his haunches a bit, and in a few moments he was no longer in his dragon form. Instead, he now looked like a child, almost a foot smaller than Noctin. His horns and tail stayed. The boy was sitting on the floor, looking up at Noctin with big green eyes. Noctin was completely oblivious to Hyac's thoughts about taking a bite out of him. When Hyac stepped back, Noctin rubbed his face off with his sleeve. So much drool. Starting to turn away, he noticed the boy sitting on the ground staring up at him with the dragon's eyes. The funding, how the teachers teach, how things are run, you know...\" Naegi shrugged, thinking to himself for a moment. \"...Plus, you make connections to people who are at the top of their skill. Somewhat intimidated now, Naegi looked back to Naoki, a soft sigh leaving his chest. The glowing markings was still offputting to him, but it wasn't too strange once you got used to it. Swallowing thickly, he decided to ignore it for now, seeing that it wasn't causing any harm. Hyacindiemo blinked a few times before a small smile grew on his face. He stood up with a bit of a struggle, he wasn't quite used to his semitheian form. It was rare that he would transform before, he never felt the need to. He didn't need to communicate with his mother or her teammates like this before. But Noctin wasn't exactly Theian. He finally nodded his head in response to Noctin's question before asking, \"What are you?\" \"That makes sense.\" Naoki replied. \"There was nothing like that in my world.\" he stated. Sure it used to have a good amount of good or private schools, but they seemed to work differently than this Hope's Peak Academy. The conversation was starting to bring back memories of his world before The Conception, but he tried to push those memories away. he asked. Noctin gave a small smile back once he had recovered from his shock. He started to move forward to help Hyac stand up but the child managed it himself. The innocent question cut far deeper than Hyac had meant it to. Noctin winced slightly. \"I'm a Desolate,\" he said quietly, not quite meeting Hyac's gaze. In the hope of avoiding an explanation, he pushed on with his own question. he asked, squinting his eyes in childish suspicion.

However, as they come together again, old wounds in the family history are torn wide open again, with hidden motives, grasping greed and unburied hatred coursing through this gathering. With the tension becoming ever more palpable, the night will suddenly descend into a battle of survival, where the strength of brotherhood is tested and a dark secret from the past will come to torment all those who stand in the way of mercy. The key to the Mercy\u2019s power lies in the incredible tautness of the film as a complete work, in particular the sense of balance in the narrative, thematic and visual construction of the film. Mercy is marked by reflection and rhythm; there is a clear sense of relationship between the repetition of imagery and iconography (the lighter, the puzzle, the bag) and our perception of character and the motivation of their desire. There is no better illustration of this balance between perception and desire than in the symmetry of brothers at the core of the film. From the early stages, the two pairs of brothers, joined together as half siblings, form an essential duality, played out in both icy cold pauses and fiery eruptions of temperament; their animosity played out in a collision of emotions. Director Chris Sparling uses this dichotomy so strongly that it acts as the driving force for the film\u2019s initial tone, before completely transforming as the narrative progressively shifts into an alternate confrontation, one that echoes the conflict of brotherhood and plays on the notion of familial bonds. Furthermore, what Mercy taps into so perfectly is not simply the invasion of the home itself, but the symbolic invasion of the family itself. With the overwhelming dysfunction established, creating a rivalry filled with suggestion and mystery, the sudden shock of the arrival of masked intruders at once naturally plays into the preconceived narrative of greed and familial distain, but more importantly, as the situation evolves, it serves to create a shift in the direction of the film, enhancing the already palpable sense of unease and relentless tension. This is reinforced by the decision to play with the linear direction of the film itself, cutting back and replaying the central dramatic set piece of the film from alternate perspectives, revealing depth and adding more pieces to a very dark puzzle indeed. Perhaps the sheer tension created in the first half of the film begins to lessen as the narrative revelations unfold, but the balance of the overall piece is so exquisitely achieved that it remains gripping with a sense of poise that is exudes quiet confidence and overwhelming quality. You could also argue that maybe it doesn\u2019t push far enough in relieving atmosphere of tension, something that could understandably frustrate those in search of catharsis; however, I personally feel that in maintaining the weight of this morally turbulent and ambiguous atmosphere serves to leave the burden of the film\u2019s murky world resting on the audience long after they leave the theater, lingering in the mind and reinforcing the simplicity of focus that makes the film such a pleasure to endure. Indeed, at its very best, the visual tone and chilling tension is reminiscent of Mike Flanagan\u2019s tremendous Hush, and stands alongside it as one of the superior home invasion thrillers in what has been a banner year for the subgenre. Mercy is a taut experience that works perfectly in the precise spectrum that the film establishes for itself, able to generate genuine menace and intrigue through the composure of its structure, visual compositions and constant sense of momentous dread in creating a conflict of families, wrought with contrast and symmetry.", "hit_ratio": 1.3247863247863247}], "3": [{"doc_text": "We are Legal Expert, a trusted advisor. Call us today for a free legal consultation. In this case study, we are going to look at the case of Mr S, whose name we have abbreviated for reasons of privacy. Mr S suffered a fractured shoulder which was initially misdiagnosed, causing him to make an NHS misdiagnosis claim. Mr S was involved in a road traffic accident and was taken to his local hospital, which we will refer to as hospital N, where his shoulder was X rayed. When he returned to the hospital, Mr S saw an Orthopedic Surgeon, who reviewed the X rays taken at the time of the accident, and found that Mr S had fractured his clavicle, also known as the collarbone, connected to the shoulder. Medical misdiagnosis cases are more common than many people think. According to a report published in 2009, nearly 1 in 6 cases are misdiagnosed in the NHS. Although the vast majority of cases of medical misdiagnosis are not significant and don\u2019t cause any serious damage, millions of NHS patients were likely to suffer serious health problems or have existing conditions made worse as a result. The report found the main reason for medical misdiagnosis in the NHS was that doctors were too quick to make judgements and were reluctant to ask more senior colleagues for help. As we have already mentioned, reviewing the initial X-rays showed that Mr S had fractured his clavicle at the time of his accident and this had initially gone undiagnosed. In the months between the misdiagnosis and the correct diagnosis, Mr S\u2019s injury had failed to unite which required surgery. After surgery Mr S made a reasonable recovery, however, had Mr S\u2019s broken clavicle been correctly diagnosed, the fracture would have united without surgery, reducing his broken shoulder recovery time, and he would have also avoided the pain and suffering he endured before he received the correct treatment. A claim on behalf of Mr S the Claimant was bought on the trust of Hospital N. The basis of the medical negligence claim was that the fracture was misdiagnosed and the failure to refer Mr S to the fracture clinic caused the Claimant unnecessary pain and suffering.

Mr Igor Loskutnikov, 19, was enjoying a skiing trip at the Val d'Is\u00e8re ski resort over the New Year. The collision caused the experienced skier\u2019s snowboard to slice across Mr Loskutnikov\u2019s right hand, resulting in a hospital stay and a ruined holiday. Due to the accident, Mr Loskutnikov suffered serious damage to the tendons in his right hand and fingers which required immediate surgery to insert a new screw and plate before he could return to the UK. The operation was fortunately successful and there was no need for further surgery. However, an expert Orthopaedic surgeon, who advised Mr Loskutnikov during his claim, said that the screw and plate would have to remain in his hand indefinitely. Despite these efforts, Mr Loskutnikov has been left with permanent residual symptoms as a result of the accident. In addition to the pain caused by his injuries, the accident caused Mr Loskutnikov great disruption with his university studies and exams. Our client managed to enter his desired profession following his studies but his injuries often cause problems for him at work.

There was a respectful knock on the door. He looked up, confused. In the doorway he distinguished the frail frame of a young woman. But he forced himself to produce a bland smile. Yet he did not stir. Instead, his eyes wandered back to rest upon their precious object. His gaze instantly darkened with raw agony. He choked. Within his blurred sight now appeared his hand, slowly moving forward, animated by a will of its own, its thirsty fingers stretching, trembling, reaching out\u2026 desperate to caress the softly smiling lips once more. Suddenly the sound of short, rasping breaths cut through the solemn air and made his blood run cold. But the instant he realised that it was his own panting, he abruptly drew his hand back and squeezed his fingers into an unforgiving fist. He brusquely pushed back his heavy chair while he rose, straightened his back and determinedly walked out of the room, leaving Margaret\u2019s portrait untouched and undefiled. Mrs Brown looked up at him with her round, innocent eyes and gently touched his elbow. Mr Thornton quickly recomposed himself, sharply realising how he had stood near the fireplace all by himself for... too long probably. The muscles in his hand cramped from holding his glass too tightly. He smiled at Mrs Brown, suspiciously searching for any pity-coloured shade in her eyes, but she had already turned to the person waiting to be introduced. Mr Thornton now allowed his gaze to move on to the unknown lady in front of him, fully conscious of how it brushed lightly along the tender skin of her bosom and neck, then fixed itself on her lips and climbed up to her eyes. His breath caught but fortunately his body responded mechanically and bowed. He opened his lips, but before he could utter a polite yet hopelessly insufficient greeting, Mr Brown cleared his throat and then, with a loud voice, invited all guests to enter the dining room. When Mr Thornton turned his attention back to the lady, her eyes still rested on him quietly. She then turned and followed the other guests. Mr Hamper shook his head and made no attempt to hide his contempt. After a moment of silence Mr Slickson leaned forward and spoke in a low voice. \u201cI can tell you this much, my fellow masters, I won\u2019t take it anymore. I have men trained who will not hesitate to beat the hell out of that rioting trash as soon as one of their so-called \u2018leaders\u2019 gets it into his ignorant mind to make a move for the engine\u2019s boiler, draw the plug and silence the looms. By Jove, how that scumbag and his comrades will regret their listening to the union!\u201d He smiled and fell back into his seat. Mr Thornton, just about to bring his fork to his mouth, nearly dropped it. All went silent at Miss Grant\u2019s softly spoken, but unusual (and therefore unwelcome) interference of the men\u2019s discussion. But Miss Grant calmly continued, carelessly adding to the increasing unease of the party. All remained silent. The ticking of the mantle clock suddenly seemed loud and intrusive. \u201cMiss Grant, Sir. Helen Grant.\u201d Her eyes softened when she looked at him. A warm, liquid, honey-textured gaze flowed towards him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry too.\u201d Miss Grant smiled, then cast her eyes down, allowing Mr Hamper time to let go of his vexation and, maybe, reconsider his response. \u201cHands can easily be replaced, Miss Grant.\u201d Mr Slickson cracked a freshly baked roll and looked at her calculatingly. Slowly he put a piece of bread in his mouth, allowing his gaze to rest heavily upon her. Miss Grant felt how her eyes fixed themselves on this mouth\u2014two moist, wide, righteous lips, lazily floating along on the movements of the giant jaws. Immediate anger flared up in the pores of the coarse skin around the fleshy lips. \u201cOh dear, I neglected to ask if perhaps you all desire some more wine?\u201d Mrs Brown gestured nervously to one of the butlers, desperate to steer away from this unfortunate conversation or... argument, God forbid! \u201cYou know that I do not know you personally, Mr Slickson,\u201d Miss Grant said, throwing Mrs Brown a reassuring smile but not allowing her attention to be diverted. Her voice welled up from deep in her throat, comforting, vast, unaffected. Mr Slickson\u2019s gaze now jumped restlessly from Miss Grant\u2019s eyes to her hands and from her hands to her eyes again, unable to make sense of this unexpected turn; heated, alarmed and suspicious of what evil trap she was setting with those smooth words of praise. In spite of his desire to thrust her away, back to where she belonged, wherever it was, to some insignificant place in time just before this sudden, unfamiliar, threatening moment was created, before he had become aware of her annoying presence\u2026 he could do little but wait and see what this unknown creature was planning to do to him. Mr Thornton had listened to her words in growing amazement, struggling to make sense of this woman and her outrageous courage to project her compassionate, but impossible views onto the men\u2019s businesses. \u201cNo offence ma\u2019am, but I do not know any of these \u2018different\u2019 workers you speak of so confidently,\u201d Mr Hamper spoke, now fully recovered and ready to charge again. \u201cYou are a... novelist, aren\u2019t you? Yes, I think Mrs Brown told me.\u201d He threw Miss Grant a carefully crafted, pitiful look. He half-hid a stiff, joyless little smile behind his napkin and looked confidently around the table, happily anticipating how his words would shut this silly woman up for good, saving this civilised party from total perplexity by putting an end to this absurd conversation. But Miss Grant still looked at him, now with a contemplating gaze. Mrs Brown couldn\u2019t help herself. All guests now looked at Mr Hamper, anxiously, helplessly (as if to ask him for directions in this total confusion), then at Miss Grant and then back at Mr Hamper. All eyes were then unwillingly drawn to Miss Grant\u2019s gaze, a serious, almost worried gaze, which, without a trace of victorious arrogance, rested calmly on Mr Hamper\u2019s now bloodless countenance. \u201cMiss Grant?\u201d A deep, yet gentle voice. It was Mr Thornton who shattered the dense atmosphere. He coughed briefly, feeling uneasy to speak, yet too intrigued to refrain from taking part. Miss Grant looked around the table, curious to learn which of the men was taking up the glove this time. She noticed that he was not leaning back lazily into the safety of the shadows\u2014which performed their dramatic play just outside the stage of the table\u2014to carelessly watch how she would respond, but instead leaned slightly forwards, one hand resting next to his plate, allowing the candles to light the regular features of his face, with a clever, alert look in his eyes. She swallowed, hesitant for a moment. Then she took a breath. His gaze intensified. She remembered my name. Mr Brown, well aware of his obligations as a host and not willing to contradict the wishes of his respected guests, rose and gestured to the butler to open the door to the smoking room. Mr Thornton, who had been fascinated by Miss Grant\u2019s passionate plea, was surprised at all the commotion. His disturbed glance, however, was quickly met by Mr Brown\u2019s commanding look, which was clearly not to be contradicted and which ordered him to leave the dining table at once and follow the other men. Mr Thornton took a deep breath. He wiped his lips with the silk napkin and placed it next to his plate. When he rose from his chair he tried to catch Miss Grant\u2019s eye, but she looked dreamily into the candle flames and took a sip of her wine, seemingly unaffected by the chaos she had just caused. Mr Thornton leaned into the cushions, his legs loosely crossed while one arm rested on the back of the sofa, an empty glass in his hand. He was tired of hearing his fellow masters express their opinions about this unknown woman in the strongest terms possible, forcing poor Mr Brown to apologise and even go as far as to blame Mrs Brown for having acted recklessly in inviting such a rude person into their intimate circle. But then the door opened and the cause of the men\u2019s crushed pride entered the room. Her silhouette was hazy at first due to the heavy, tobacco-scented mist, but when she stepped forward it became clear and vibrant. Mr Thornton was stunned to see her standing there, in a simple but beautiful evening dress which seemed to make her shine like a precious star. But then the sacred spell, which had silently slipped into the room with her, was deliberately disgraced by a crude snort from Mr Hamper. She looked around the room, her lips curled into a smile, as if to thank the men for trying to slaughter her just a while ago. Mr Brown, utterly confused by her appearance and bold words, stuttered something unintelligible and bowed awkwardly. But instead of allowing Mr Brown to lead her back to the other ladies, her gaze swiftly traveled through the room, scrutinised it, then spotted whom it was looking for\u2014Mr Thornton. He gasped for air as if she had just put a bullet in his gut. What on earth\u2026? Now she started to walk over to him, calmly, forcing the others to hold their breath... and watch her movements in deathly silence. Mr Thornton rose quickly, the blood rushed from his brain, he almost stumbled, then bowed to steady himself. He looked at her soft eyes, desperately searching his mind to say something, anything, for God\u2019s sake!, then noticed how her hand reached out to him. Only then he saw a note in the palm of her hand. She looked at him intensely while she smiled her comforting smile. He cleared his throat, then took her gently by the wrist, pretending to shake her hand while slipping the note into his hand. She nodded politely. He opened his lips to speak, but Miss Grant had already turned away and swept from the room. The smell of roast beef, smouldering coals and bees wax. The sound of the clock\u2019s majestic ticking. The smooth sensation of polished parquet underneath his leather shoes. Mr Thornton stood in the shadowy, candlelit hallway of his mansion, ready to ascend the elaborate, carved wood staircase to his rooms. He loosened his tie and unbuttoned the collar of his shirt. Then he remembered the note in the pocket of his jacket. Seconds after Miss Grant had left the room, the masters in the smoking room had roared in disbelief, relieved like a pack of college boys once they knew they were safe from the danger of her clever observations, then scrambled to compete with one another in a foul game of humiliating her with grotesque judgements. Mr Thornton, unwilling to be involved in such a despicable display of male cowardliness, had warmly shaken Mr Brown\u2019s trembling hand and left. As his one hand tightened its grip instinctively, squeezing the candlestick, his other hand let go and dropped the note. While he bent to pick it up, he could feel his quickening heartbeat rushing through his temples. He pushed his elbow against the stair rail to gain his balance, waited to let the dizziness dissipate, impatiently unfolded the paper again while pointing the vigorously flickering candle towards it and, eager to find out if he had understood the message correctly the first time, read it again. A mixture of sharp excitement and faint nausea spread through his belly. He placed the candlestick back on the side table and sat down on the wide, ebony stairs. He held the note in his hands and scrutinised her handwriting. It was feminine, elegant, written with precision. No frills, no poetic subtleties, no hide and seek. Just the bare message\u2014short, factual, bold. He felt his stomach contract while his gaze moved along the lines. Back and forth. Back and forth. Suddenly a vision of Miss Beckett appeared before his mind\u2019s eye, as clear as if she was right there, standing in front of him, brightly lit in the dark hallway. Miss Beckett in her beautiful, expensive, ivory-coloured muslin dress she had worn during that never-ending evening at her parents\u2019 summer house. Mrs Thornton, his mother, was bent on him marrying Miss Beckett to secure her son\u2019s future\u2014and her own. But she had approved of him, so Mrs Beckett had happily informed Mrs Thornton. Not that Miss Beckett would confide in her mother about matters of the heart, but she had confided in her best friend (naturally under the strict condition of confidentiality) who had told Mrs Beckett less than four-and-twenty hours later. Mrs Beckett, in her turn, had enlightened Mrs Thornton by letter. While she scrutinised his face\u2014as if that would have stopped the news from taking its horribly wrong, irreversible turn\u2014she helplessly watched how a crack, as fine as a silk thread, suddenly made its appearance and started to find its way down the smooth, moist surface of his eye, frosting his usually bright gaze for just a second. At that moment she knew that all hope of a happy marriage was lost. \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that, mother.\u201d He had spoken mechanically before casting his eyes down. They had sat there motionless, each seated at opposite ends of the breakfast table, both feeling crushed about his lack of romantic feelings for young Miss Perfect. Still, the inevitable course of life was not to be hindered by the irrationality of feelings or the inconvenience of sentiments, and so arrangements were swiftly put in motion. The fact that Mr Thornton did not love Miss Beckett was unfortunate\u2014and God knew how Mrs Thornton had tried everything in her power to find him an object of love in the person of Miss Beckett\u2014but she was relieved to find that John had listened to her plea calmly, then had dutifully accepted a future with Miss Beckett as the best option there was. At least he will be loved, Mrs Thornton had thought in an attempt to find a ray of light in this dim prospect, stubbornly pushing away the distress of expecting to see her son continue to struggle through an unhappy and unfulfilling life... after the misery he had suffered already. Mr Thornton was seven-and-thirty years of age now, and he understood perfectly well it was time that a new Mrs John Thornton should take the stage, as his mother had so forcefully suggested to him for the past two years. Miss Beckett was three-and-twenty and as ready as could be to fulfil the many tasks of her life\u2019s destiny as a wife, a mother and head of her household. That summer evening Miss Beckett had honoured her parents\u2019 outstanding accomplishment of having given her the finest education possible, by entertaining their highly respected guests with her virtuoso piano playing. Mr Thornton had watched how, after the solo performance, she had taken in the impassioned applause with a proud little smile on her thin lips, blissfully unaware of her natural gaze which had remained unaffected and blank. When Mr Thornton awoke from his meditations and realised he was still sitting on the stairs in the dim hallway, he suddenly remembered Miss Grant\u2019s mysterious, warm, thoughtful eyes as she had stood before him\u2014her hand reaching out to him, the note in the palm of her hand, perfectly calm. No doubt. No fear. Not a single flicker in the pupil of her eye. But that evening she hadn\u2019t given the impression of suffering from a nervous affliction, which so many ladies nowadays seemed to be falling victim to. On the contrary\u2014she had seemed to know perfectly well what she was doing\u2026 only playing a different game than generally approved of. How much of a chance do I have of meeting you for lunch this week to continue our conversation? An open question, lightheartedly expressed as if spoken to a close friend rather than written to a complete stranger, confidently unbothered by the outcome. He could imagine her asking him face-to-face, her head slightly tilted, a hint of a cheeky smile on her lips, a playful look in her eyes, knowing he wouldn\u2019t be able to resist such an inappropriate yet exciting request.", "hit_ratio": 4.94017094017094}, {"doc_text": "Her life depended on his name. His heart depended on her love. It was a most humiliating situation. Mistress Claire Curran of London arrived at the Virginia office of her uncle's solicitor knowing nothing of the private correspondence she bore. With a simple break of the seal, she was hopelessly trapped in a shameless bargain: her hand given in marriage to a stranger to clear an unpaid debt. Alone and penniless, at first she has no means of escaping her lowly fate. But she pledges to be no man's pawn in such a dishonorable game--and certainly no man's wife. With a sharp mind and an unbreakable spirit, Claire devises to play the part of Rosewind's mistress...but only until she can find a way out. Devon Rivard finds himself in a maddening dilemma: he can either sell his ancestral home to pay his brother's gambling debts, or marry one Claire Curran, the fiery-tempered messenger who has so innocently tossed the black-hearted ultimatum into his lap. Resigned yet furious, he vows to annul the marriage once the debt is cleared. She wins his heart, a prize he thought forever safely walled away. Can he convince her to stay by his side as the clouds of war gather, or will circumstances beyond his control take her away from him forever? Chapter One Williamsburg, Virginia April, 1774 Murder would have been a kinder fate, Claire thought, resisting the urge to chew on her lower lip. There'd be plenty of time for that after she found a way out of the ugly Byzantine maze her uncle had crafted. If only she'd managed to sleep some the night before. She needed a clear head, a mind that could wrest salvation from thin air. And now all she had to show for the effort was a brain that had all the power and clarity of lukewarm oatmeal. \"I hope, Mistress Curran, that you found your lodgings suitable?\" Perched on the edge of the chair, Claire forced herself to swallow past the tightness in her throat, took as deep a breath as her stays permitted, and met the gaze of the man standing behind the desk. \"They're more than adequate for my needs, Mr. Cantrell. I appreciate your thoughtfulness and effort on my behalf.\" The solicitor lifted a sheaf of papers, perused them briefly, and then cast them down with a soft sigh. \"It's the least I can do under the circumstances. Devon isn't likely to be as concerned with the warmth of your welcome.\" She didn't have to remove her worn kid gloves to know that her primly laced fingers had turned a ghostly white. Adjusting the drape of her dress and flexing the blood back to her fingertips, she said, \"I'm no happier with the circumstances than Mr. Rivard will be. If a way can be found to escape the situation, I assure you that I'll do so.\" Edmund Cantrell arched a pale brow and again picked up the sheaf of papers lying on the desk. You're aware of that, aren't you, Mistress Curran?\" \"I had no knowledge of either the nature or the contents of the letter before yesterday, and I'll swear such before God. \"Please,\" the young solicitor hurried to inject. It's Devon who concerns me. He has a streak of suspicion in him that's both wide and notorious. He won't be as . . .\" The man sighed and stared down at the papers as he shook his head. Claire pivoted in the chair, turning toward the office doorway and the direction from which the question had come. A man stood framed within it, the dark curls on his head only a scant distance from the top of the doorway, a mere sliver of space existing between his massive shoulders and the oaken sides of the jamb. The morning light stood at his back and cast his facial features into gray shadows. But she didn't have to see his face to guess the expression he wore. She could tell much about his state of mind by the broad stance he took in the doorway, by the way he commanded the room into which he faced. He was annoyed at having to be there, and he was determined to dispatch the business at hand as quickly as possible. She fixed her gaze on the desk before the affable Mr. Cantrell and fought back the wave of panic that threatened to propel her out of the chair, out of the office, down the street, and into blissful oblivion. A sense of pending doom settled over her shoulders even as she silently prayed, Please, dear God, let this be some other man. the stranger repeated, stepping across the threshold and stripping the woolen greatcoat from his shoulders. He turned toward the young man as though they were the only occupants of the room. \"Come now, I'm a busy man and I don't have the time for parlor games.\" Her heart sank with certainty. Devon Rivard made a soft, dismissive sound before replying, \"Hardly a great revelation, Edmund. \"And it is, I assure you,\" Cantrell responded, sweeping his hand in a wide gesture toward Claire. \"May I introduce Mistress Claire Curran, of London.\" For a quick moment Claire considered correcting the details of the introduction, to provide her former title and her proper place of residence, but then just as quickly decided against it. To be a lady trapped in a situation of obviously lower, trading-class origins . . . Besides, she admitted, the truth of what she was and where she came from wouldn't make a bit of difference in the larger, ugly scheme of things about to unfold. Without a word, Claire rose to her feet with a wholly feigned aplomb. The young attorney continued with the formalities, saying, \"Mistress Curran, may I present Mr. Devon Rivard, owner of Rosewind and one of the region's preeminent citizens.\" \"A compliment undeserved, I assure you,\" the newcomer said smoothly, turning toward her with the most abbreviated of bows. He was a rakishly handsome man with sooty eyelashes that framed eyes of darkest emerald, a mouth wide and full and somehow mocking, the corners etched with lines that seemed more faded than faint. Yet it was an intangible something about him that knotted a cord deep in the center of her chest. His gaze skimmed the length of her, and she wondered if he knew that her secondhand sack dress was three years past fashionable and that she'd deepened the seams of the bodice to fit her meager attributes. With what little resolve she had remaining, Claire said, \"It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Rivard. I only wish that the circumstances were of a different nature.\" He lifted a dark brow while he offered her another brief bow. She thought the slight curve of one side of his mouth belied the compliment, and a flicker of ire coursed through her veins. Claire dipped her chin ever so slightly in the direction of Edmund Cantrell, saying, \"I believe you'll shortly abandon any such thinking, sir.\" To her relief, the sandy-haired young man cleared his throat, lifted several pieces of parchment from his desktop, and began, \"Mistress Curran arrived in Williamsburg late yesterday afternoon bearing sealed correspondence from Mr. George Seaton-Smythe. You're acquainted with the gentleman, are you not, Devon?\" Claire watched the tall American stride across the office to toss his cloak over the back of an elegantly carved chair. His boots were of soft black leather, rising to his knees and conforming to his calves. His frock coat was well tailored, the fit fashionably loose and covering the rest of him from her perusal. Everything about him spoke of a powerful man quite used to getting his way. \"'Gentleman' is a term I'd use only loosely to describe Seaton-Smythe,\" Rivard replied, his back to her and his attorney. Folding his arms across his chest and fixing his gaze on something beyond the window glass, he added, \"I know him only by reputation. Her heart racing, Claire took a long, deep breath, stared at the carpet, and hoped that the attorney would make short work of the ugly business at hand. \"It appears that Wyndom doesn't share your assessment of the man,\" Edmund Cantrell continued. \"On the fourth day of January last he entered into a contract with--\" \"For what sum?\" Claire heard the steely edge of anger. \"Two thousand pounds sterling,\" answered the attorney, his voice soft in an apparent effort to ease the harshness of the truth. \"According to Seaton-Smythe, Wyndom has been either unwilling or unable to repay the debt.\" \"Tell me, Edmund . . . Did Seaton-Smythe have the gall to pretend that he ever expected my besotted brother to conduct himself honorably?\" Cantrell quietly cleared his throat and went on. \"Mr. Seaton-Smythe has offered three alternatives for correcting the unfortunate situation. As his first offer, he suggests that you permit him to legally attach your present and future consignments until the debt is paid in full. Should that be unacceptable, then he suggests that you pay the entire amount, in sterling. Rivard broadened his stance and didn't look away from the window as he asked, \"And the third . . . alternative?\" Again Cantrell cleared his throat before he spoke. Claire closed her eyes as she listened to him reply, \"Mr. Seaton-Smythe has offered to cancel the debt upon delivery of legal proof of your marriage to his niece.\" Cantrell drew a long breath. \"The same Mistress Claire Curran.\" She heard the slow measure of Rivard's turn, felt the heat of his attention boring through her. Swallowing back the bitter taste of mortal embarrassment, Claire opened her eyes and met his gaze. Never in all her days had she seen such loathing, such unadulterated hatred in a man's eyes. She opened her mouth to speak, but couldn't make a sound. \"Mistress Curran wishes to find some manner of evading the proposal,\" the young attorney offered in hasty rescue. \"Have you, mistress, any property you'd be willing to forfeit for payment of my brother's debt?\" Her eyes aching from the threat of angry tears, Claire again shook her head. \"Seaton-Smythe has offered to cancel the debt upon the receipt of proof of your marriage. He made no stipulations regarding the nature of that union or the duration. Perhaps . . .\" \"A divorce?\" The young attorney stared blankly at the top of his desk and shook his head in slow disagreement. \"Intriguing, yes, but with attendant difficulties, Devon. As you well know, Virginia lacks the power to grant them, and so the case must be made in England itself. Additionally, acceptable grounds are very narrow and would cause the both of you permanent social scars. I was thinking of a slightly less scandalous way out of the marriage contract. One that we can manage in our own house, so to speak.\" Claire heard herself ask in a stunned whisper. \"Are you suggesting that the marriage be annulled after my uncle has pardoned the debt?\" \"Not too terribly honorable, I know,\" Edmund replied. Devon Rivard's gaze swept her from head to hem, contempt shining in his eyes and twisting his lips into a cruel smile. \"And how quickly the lady thought of it.\" \"How dare you, sir, cast aspersions on my character. She lifted her chin and appraised him in much the same manner as he had her only a moment before. \"I'd rather bed the Devil himself than consider marriage to such a self-consumed fool.\" He cocked a brow in slow consideration. Deep within his eyes a flame kindled. \"You speak of your circumstances,\" he said, his voice soft and yet somehow sharply cutting. Stepping around the chair, Claire took her cloak from the wall peg, saying as she did, \"I owe you no accounting, Mr. Rivard. And I'll give you none. Seek a solution to your dilemma as best you can, but don't expect me to be a party to it.\" She draped the woolen cloth over her shoulders and, while fastening the frog at the neck, added, \"I'll make arrangements to return to London as soon as possible. If you wish for me to bear your payment to my uncle, please see that it's delivered to my lodgings before I depart Williamsburg. Mr. Cantrell knows where to find me.\" She turned to find the attorney staring at her, his blue eyes large in his face. \"Mr. Cantrell,\" she said, dropping her chin in polite acknowledgment, \"I sincerely appreciate your kindness and--\" \"And how is it that you intend to pay for your passage back to London?\" Rivard asked, his tone no kinder than before. His arms were once again crossed over his chest, but he had shifted his stance so that he rested his weight casually on one leg. The gaze that met hers was cool and distant. His words struck her like a fist. Her throat tightened and she willed back the hot torrent of words. \"It doesn't matter on which side of the Atlantic you stand,\" he continued, both his tone and the light within his eyes hardening. \"George Seaton-Smythe has the reputation of a wharf rat. That you're of some blood relation to him counts against you.

Her gaze then followed his to the bed, where more silken draperies hung from the big four-poster. \"Of course, I shall sleep on the floor,\" he said. \"Of course.\" She shrugged. And I shall insist you take the counterpane to fold into a little mattress.\" \"I suppose they shall also give you privacy.\" \"True. \"Oh, Airy, that is so kind of you.\" Very fortunate, indeed. As she directed a smile at him, his lashes lowered. She was certain his compliment now embarrassed him. He was not the smooth-talking, bed hopper she'd wager his twin brother was. Reflecting over her own smooth-talking, bed-hopping late husband, she was now happy that he'd been possessed of those traits. Otherwise, his demise would have been too, too painful. She sighed. Yes, the girl who married Mr. Steffington would be most fortunate. Whenever my little nephews visit me in Bath, I make them a pallet on the floor of my bedchamber.\" She set about to remove the quilt from the bed, fold it lengthwise, and place it on the floor beside her own bed. \"My feet won't mind hanging off.\" He cracked a smile. \"Allow me to guess. \"You are possessed of the silliest sense of humor.\" He eyed the pallet. \"I thought he was charming.\" Mr. Steffington frowned. \"You would. He shamelessly flirted with a married woman!\" \"Well. . .I'm not actually a married woman.\" Mr. Steffington's deep sense of morality touched her. She gave him a puzzled look. \"I hadn't noticed Lord Seacrest flirting. \"Because I had the good fortune to marry you.\" He shrugged. \"Oh, Airy, that is so sweet that you think being married to me is a good thing.\" Seconds later, she feigned a yawn. \"I suppose I am rather tired.\" His glance flicked to her valise, then to his beside it. He cleared his throat. She was coming to learn that he cleared his throat every time he was about to say something that he thought might be construed as too intimate. \"You don't have to leave the room.\" His gaze absently lowered to her bodice, then whipped away. \"Then I vow to turn my back and close and my eyes whilst you . . . ah, remove your. . . well, you know.\" Those dark eyes of his rounded. \"Oh, but I must. You're a lady, and I'm a gentleman.\" She stood. When he finished, she sat on that left side of the bed and listened to his footsteps move away. \"I, ah, shall need to restore my shirt first.\" How she would love to see him without his shirt. \"Don't bother. After all, it was quite dark within the cubicle of her bed. I didn\u2019t mean to imply. . .\" He quietly moved across the carpet. \"Where should you like the sliver of light?\" \"The foot of the bed will do nicely, thank you.\" And would afford a glimpse of him. Seconds later, a buttery vertical light striped the foot of her bed, and she stealthily watched as he moved back to his pallet with the powerful majesty of a panther. Firelight glanced along the tawny length of his long, lean, and wonderfully bare torso. Yes, she thought to herself, her breath a bit ragged, the girl who snared dear Mr. Steffington would indeed be fortunate.", "hit_ratio": 1.5213675213675213}, {"doc_text": "THE FIRST PRICKLE of unease wormed through Caro when the lawyer\u2019s gaze slid from her to Barbara and then down to the papers in front of him\u2014her father\u2019s will, presumably.

Fitzwilliam, etc., as well as the new facets we see of the familiar characters. Lizzie\u2019s stay at Hunsford is one of the most dramatic getaways one can imagine. Prompts: What are your feelings on this scene; what do you think of the behavior of both Darcy and Lizzie. Contrast this to Lizzie's first proposal from Collins. Is Lizzie's complete surprise believable, especially in light of Charlotte's prolonged insistence that Darcy feels something for Lizzie, and the slight hints Darcy drops prior to the proposal? In terms of the fact that Darcy points out how poor Lizzy is, I would say that he is just as bad as Mr. Collins. Not cool, kids. Even though Mr. Darcy is a total fox, one can\u2019t help but be infuriated by his first proposal to Lizzy, considering that he talks about how beneath him she is, yet speaks with \u201cno doubt of a favourable answer\u201d (185). Ugh. At least Darcy, unlike Collins, does not threaten to continue asking Elizabeth until she says yes. Yes, Darcy has made a few flirtatious comments here and there. However, I feel like a lot of Darcy noticing and thinking about Elizabeth has been exposed not through dialogue, but through description. Share your thoughts on this from the perspective of the modern woman (presumably) you are, and from the perspective of a Regency gentlewoman. Consider the reactions of the people in her life, especially Mrs Bennet, if they were to find out. I don\u2019t remember precisely how old Lizzy is during Pride and Prejudice, but I believe she is between 20 and 23 (I seem to remember Lydia at one point mentioning that Jane is 23). I tend to think that a lot of people nowadays get married when they are somewhere between the ages of 25 and 30 (I know some people get married earlier, but I\u2019m making a guess here). So really, for Lizzy to have two marriage proposals isn\u2019t all that surprising. If Mrs. Bennet were to find out that Lizzy had turned down Mr. Collins AND Mr. Darcy, I\u2019m pretty sure she would never speak to Lizzy again. Believe it or not, I actually think Mr. Collins and Mr. Darcy are both entitled to be shocked. Second of all, he is going to inherit Longbourn after Mr. Bennet dies. This means that should Collins so chose, he could kick all seven of the Bennets out, leaving them to try and find some other they can live with or be destitute. By the way, if you don\u2019t remember, not one of the Bennet girls is married at the time of Collins\u2019 proposal, so if Mr. Bennet were to die suddenly....well, you get the picture. I can\u2019t help but wonder if any of the Bennet girls consider Lizzy selfish for turning Collins down, even though they\u2019re probably also glad he didn\u2019t target them. Mr. Darcy has ten thousand pounds of year, which is an absolute crapload of money in Regency England. While that doesn\u2019t entitle him to be a snob, some have argued that his inheritance plus his lineage have given him a certain right to be proud. So now we see Darcy trying to make amends for everything that has gone wrong, while Lizzy gets a much better glimpse of who Darcy really is. Knowing how the book ends kind of makes me give a happy sigh every time I come across this visit. Discuss Lady Catherine's visit to Longbourn, and Lizzie's showdown with her. Also discuss Mr Bennet's reaction to the rumors of Darcy's feelings for Lizzie, and then his reaction when they prove to be more than rumors. If the fact that Lady Catherine went all the way to Longbourn just to make sure Lizzy isn\u2019t marrying Darcy doesn\u2019t prove that she\u2019s a snob, then I don\u2019t know what does. I think Lizzy holds her own quite well. As for Mr. Bennet\u2019s initial reaction, my heart hurts for Lizzy. When he founds out that Lizzy and Darcy is engaged, I can\u2019t totally blame him for his reaction. I\u2019m always thrilled to see Lizzy in such a state of euphoria. Discuss the way Darcy and Lizzie relate to each other at the end of the book, and Darcy's second (much superior) proposal. Darcy\u2019s second proposal makes me cry every. Single. Time. A huge plot point in this novel is Darcy putting aside his pride and actually listening to Elizabeth. I think after seeing all of the drama unfold he understands her family\u2019s financial situation better. Plus, I think their opinions on the absurdity of Lady Catherine and Mrs. Bennet are similar. Give us your thoughts of the book on the whole. I love every character, even the ones I simply love to hate. The humor. The drama. The romance.

They had no clue as to their location and had presumed the men were taking them to the local jail, as it would be unusual for such accusations to be assumed and a sentence proclaimed without a trial. The men were certain they would be able to clear up the misunderstanding, as the Darcy and Fitzwilliam family names were highly respected all over England. As the colonel was buying horses for the military, the papers he carried would support their claim. Hopefully the issue before them would be resolved quickly, and the gentlemen could be on their way. Once inside the shed, the cousins realized it was being used as an office. Behind a large, highly polished desk, sat a man who was wearing an unusual uniform. When the man spoke, it was with a distinct accent. \u201cRees, what do we have here?\u201d the man behind the desk inquired of a man standing near the door. The captain sat with his elbows on the arms of the chair in which he sat, with his fingers forming a steeple. Peering over his fingers, he took in the measure of the men standing before him. Rees leaned towards the cousins, striking Fitzwilliam in the stomach with a club Rees had been holding. The men walked towards a rundown building. There was a dim light visible through the filthy window near the door of the building. Rees pushed the door open, before motioning for the men to enter. Stepping inside, Darcy and Fitzwilliam discovered several other men, most lying on bunkbeds. William Collins arrived on the doorstep of his distant cousin. Collins had grown up with his father telling tales of being treated badly by Mr Thomas Bennet, as the elder Collins was certain that his cousin had taken what was rightfully his, the estate of Longbourn. Every year that went by without the Bennets having a son, Collins\u2019 father took great pleasure. He knew that the estate was entailed along the male members of the family. Without a son, the Bennet family would lose Longbourn to Collins. Collins planned to marry one of the Bennet daughters, thereby controlling her life, and the lives of her mother and sisters when Thomas Bennet was dead and buried. Collins was not the brightest of men, and he had struggled while he was in school. Lady Catherine de Bourgh of Rosings Park, in Kent, gave him the living at Hunsford Parrish. To Collins, it was akin to be the parson of royalty. Immediately, the parson began inspecting everything, the manor house, the park surrounding, the stables, and more. When he knocked on the door of the manor house, he counted how quickly the staff came to allow him entrance. Once he had been privileged enough to see Rosings Park, and the opulence of everything Lady Catherine touched, he could not wish for anything less for he\u2019s own life. As William Collins, master of Longbourn, he would feel near royalty himself. Mrs Hill led Mr Collins down a hallway, knocking on a door near the rear of the house. Collins was not impressed with the interior of the home, it was lacking, just as the exterior had been. The voice of a man called from the other side of the door, beckoning them to enter. He was determined to dislike all the Bennet family, and from what he had already seen, it would not be difficult. \u201cAh, Mr Collins. It is a pleasure to meet you, cousin.\u201d Thomas Bennet stated as he stood from behind his desk. \u201cCousin. So, this is Longbourn.\u201d The parson said with an obvious disgust in his tone. \u201cAnd he was all out of parchment to give you a proper bill of sale.\u201d A second man stated. \u201cWe will see that changes are made, once we return to England.\u201d Darcy stated. \u201cYou will never leave this place.\u201d Liam stated. Most of the men looked down at the ground, muttering their agreement. Darcy and Fitzwilliam glanced around at the men, witnessing the submission they were demonstrating for the captain and his men. Two other men stepped on each side of Fitzwilliam, taking hold of the man\u2019s arms, and led him to the wagon. They assisted both Fitzwilliam and Darcy up on the wagon, then climbed aboard themselves. Elizabeth stomped across the field to the north of her father\u2019s house, towards the estate of Netherfield Park. Her sister had been invited, the day before, to take tea with the sisters of her betrothed, as his second sister, Caroline Bingley had arrived. Longbourn received a missive from Mr Bingley that his betrothed had taken a chill, and he was insistent that she remain at her future home until she was completely well. \u201cWhen Lizzy and Mr Darcy are married. They are to wed in a double wedding with Jane and Mr Bingley.\u201d Kitty answered. \u201cMrs Bennet, please control yourself. Mr Darcy will return and he will marry our Lizzy. I have no doubt as to his love of our daughter. Mr Darcy shall return in plenty time for the wedding.\u201d Mr Bennet declared. With that, Elizabeth left the room, and found herself outside the house. She needed Jane to reassure her. And Mr Bingley would know if his closest friend was leading her into folly.", "hit_ratio": 1.990990990990991}, {"doc_text": "Lady Catherine knew that there was only one way she could foil the plans of her nephew to marry Elizabeth Bennet, and he was currently in her bedchamber, waiting for Lady Catherine to return. They had spoken earlier in the day of the possibility of having to eliminate the young lady, but how to do so without anyone realizing what had truly happened? As they neared the stretch that would lead directly to the room in which Elizabeth Bennet was sleeping, the footman turned to his employer. Knowing he had no one to blame but himself, for choosing the life he had and lowering himself to bed such a disgusting woman, he also knew there were far worst ways to earn the funds he desired. His mother wished to purchase the inn at which she had worked for years, and he would make sure that his mother was able to achieve her goal. All of his life, the young man knew his mother sacrificed and worked hard to give him a good life. It was his turn to do whatever he could to provide for her. The pair continued towards the secret door, and once there, the footman carefully opened the door into the dressing chamber. They moved further inside the apartment, until Lady Catherine took her place at the foot of the bed, so she could watch her servant rid her life of the young lady who had entrapped her nephew. As the footman reached over to take hold of one of the pillows, a hand came out of the darkness and grabbed hold of the footman\u2019s, stilling his progression. The sound of a match striking was heard from across the room, and the lit match was used to light a candle near the main door of the bedchamber. In the light, the face of Thomas Bennet was illuminated. As Mr Bennet came into view, the coverlet was moved, to reveal Fitzwilliam Darcy, who had been hidden in the bedding, beside Elizabeth Bennet. The men knew something was going to happen, and they were ready to catch the deadly pair in the act, so there would be no difficulties in bringing justice. Darcy removed himself from the bed, leaving Elizabeth, who was wide awake, against the pillows that would have been used to snuff out her life, if Lady Catherine had had her way. \u201cI knew you would try something, Aunt Catherine. That is why Mr Bennet and I stayed in this room. You would have continued your attacks if we had moved Elizabeth to another room, so we needed to witness your attempt to harm my betrothed.\u201d The word rolled off his tongue sweetly. Betrothed. A small smile bubbled to the surface. Jerome turned and reached out his hands, in an attempt to reach hers, only to have Darcy step between the two of them, while Mr Bennet came up from behind Lady Catherine. \u201cDarcy, perhaps it would be best if you took hold of your aunt. I doubt that Mr Bittle will be any problem, as it is in his best interest to behave himself. If he does, I will speak on his behalf.\u201d Mr Bennet stated for all to hear. Elizabeth had reached over and pulled the tassel, which was connected to a bell in the servants\u2019 dining room. Unknown to Lady Catherine and her servant, Mr Phillips, Mr Bingley, and Sir William were in the servants\u2019 dining room, waiting for the signal. As Darcy took hold of his aunt, the other three men entered the room. And when Gerald Darcy had been severely angered, it was wise to steer clear of him. Darcy stepped closer to the window, looking out at the dark covering the land. He could not speak, his anger was so great that he could not say all that he felt. It was difficult for him to control himself when he was so emotional. Bingley nodded his head, and he led Lady Catherine from the room, with Mr Phillips following. Sir William and Mr Bennet moved closer to Jerome. You can read the letter, I will not write against any of you.\u201d Jerome said. He knew that his best odds of having any sort of life would be to do as the men told him. All Lady Catherine could now offer him for his loyalty was death at the end of a rope. \u201cIt is to protect her and her family from the scandal that would come if there were a trial. Mr Bennet and Sir William are willing to have you transported, I am certain the men will agree with me on this.\u201d Darcy said, turning his head to view the two men. Mr Bennet nodded his head, seeing the wisdom of Darcy\u2019s words. \u201cThen you will write to your mother and a date will be fixed for your departure.\u201d Darcy stated. Mr Bennet and Sir William led Jerome from the room, leaving Elizabeth and Darcy alone, though the door was standing open. \u201cThen it is a good thing that Mr Darcy is to be your husband.\u201d Jane replied. \u201cMy goodness, Jane, I believe that is the most unkind thing I have ever heard you say.\u201d Elizabeth stated. She was growing fatigued from their discussion. A smile grew on Elizabeth\u2019s lips. Over the following days, the Bennets had remained at Netherfield, as Mr Bennet wished to ensure his continued participation in decisions being made, not to mention, he wished to make certain that Elizabeth was on the mend before she was moved. It was expected to take at least a week before word would arrive from Matlock. We just sent a rider with a message two days ago.\u201d Darcy inquired, shaking the hand of his mother\u2019s brother. Her brother, Lord Matlock, Henry Fitzwilliam, entered the room. I am your sister, the first born child in our family. The physician arrived, and the decision was made. Since Lady Catherine showed no signs of repenting her actions, and there was fear that she would cause harm to others, she would be placed, involuntarily, in an asylum that was located in Kent. It would be close enough for Anne to visit her mother, if she wished. Though it was a painful decision for Lord Matlock to make, he knew that the health and safety of his entire family was at stake, and he was the head of the family. While the plans were being made for Lady Catherine\u2019s journey to the asylum, Darcy was spending as much time with his betrothed. The couple had determined to marry the following week, with a common license from the parson at Longbourn. Elizabeth was growing stronger each day, and, by the time Lord Matlock prepared to leave with his sister, Elizabeth was able to spend some time each day in her sitting room. The swelling was completely faded before the wedding, and Darcy insisted that he did not care what gown she wore, as he knew he would not even notice, once he looked into her eyes. This caused Elizabeth to blush deeply. A longing came over Elizabeth\u2019s expression. The Bennet family had returned to Longbourn a few days before the wedding of Elizabeth and Mr Darcy. After dining one evening, Mr Bennet remembered he had left his book in his bedchambers. He walked up the stairs to retrieve the book, then returned to his study. As he entered the door of his study, he was shocked at the sight before him. Mrs Bennet was sitting on the sofa, a book in her hand, reading. Beside her was Kitty, and she too had a book in hand, her attention completely consumed by the words. Lydia was lying on her stomach on the floor, in a most unladylike manner, with a novel held in her hands. \u201cPlease, Papa, might we remain here to read. Mamma will not allow me to be on the floor in the drawing room. She says it is unladylike.\u201d Lydia added. Mr Bennet was not pleased with the invasion of his privacy, but he sat down, behind his desk, and opened his book. Over the days to come, it would be common to find the family spending their evenings in such a manner, with Mary and Jane joining. The morning of Elizabeth\u2019s wedding to Fitzwilliam Darcy began with a light snowfall. Not a terrible storm, as the one they had been forced to endure, but a dusting of powdery snow to make the world fresh and clean. Elizabeth smiled, feeling the world was telling her that the day would begin new and fresh, just as the pure snow that sparkled in the sunlight. Mrs Bennet was in a state of nerves, wishing to make certain that the wedding preparations were all they could be, with the constraints on the amount of time she had to prepare. She felt they should wait for at least four or five months, so a wedding fit for a man of Darcy\u2019s station could be held. The dear woman could not understand that her soon to be son was not fond of the glamor of the ton. The couple insisted on a simple wedding, with only family and a few close friends. The wedding breakfast would also be simple, nothing elaborate, much to Mrs Bennet\u2019s chagrin. They would remain in Town for a fortnight, spending some of the time with Mrs Bennet\u2019s brother and his family. Mr and Mrs Gardiner had always been fond of Elizabeth, and looked forward to knowing her new husband. After the new year had begun, Mrs Bennet would finally be blessed in planning the wedding she wished for her daughters, as Jane Bennet had become engaged to Charles Bingley. Elizabeth was pleased with her sister\u2019s betrothal, as she knew how much Jane loved Bingley. When Mr Bennet entered the chapel with his most beloved daughter on his arm, leading her to the man whose heart now belonged to her, Mr Darcy was true to his word. If anyone had inquired as to the color of her gown or the adornments in her hair, Darcy would have been unable to inform them. He finally came to understand his parents\u2019 marriage, and the emptiness with which his father had struggled after his mother died. The vows were exchanged, and soon enough, Darcy was staring into the eyes of the new Mistress of Pemberley and Darcy House. Mrs Elizabeth Darcy. After spending as little time as possible at the breakfast, the couple made their excuses to leave. There is no reason for you to remain at Hurst\u2019s townhouse alone.\u201d Darcy knew his friend had sent his sister to visit relations in the north, and had no plans to accept Caroline in his home in the future. \u201cI would be pleased, Darcy. I am not certain when Louisa and Hurst will return, as they planned to visit Hurst\u2019s family at their estate. So I would have been alone in that big house.\u201d Bingley smiled. Darcy and Elizabeth were soon on their way to London, and to the beginning of their life together. They found comfort in each other, in a way they had never known before. Elizabeth could see the affection the elder housekeeper held for the Master. They had long feared the sort of lady that would become the next Mrs Darcy, especially when they saw such young ladies as Miss Bingley attempting to capture Darcy for a husband. \u201cA bath would be delightful, Mrs Jefferson. And I am certain that the refreshments will be appreciated, as my husband and I had a difficult time concentrating on the food my mother served this morning.\u201d Elizabeth admitted. The furnishings are much like my husband, refined and elegant, yet comfortable and sturdy.\u201d Elizabeth\u2019s cheeks suddenly reddened when she realized that her words could be misconstrued. The couple spent their first week alone at Darcy House, with only a few servants seeing them outside of their rooms. Elizabeth was pleased to learn that the man she married was the kindest and best of men, and that his love for her was true. AH, such a sweet ending. Lady Catherine and Jerome\u2026the image of him servicing her is just ghastly. Anne will be so much better without her running things. Darcy and Lizzie together will always be the greatest love story ever.", "hit_ratio": 3.3783783783783785}], "2": [{"doc_text": "We'll take a look at all of the factors conspiring to keep Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy apart as well as read some of Jane Austen's sparkling prose. Pick a movie: How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, Bridget Jones' Diary, Knocked Up, When Harry Met Sally. She kind of invented this plot; she invented the 'people don't like each other and then they fall in love' story. She, actually, originally titled the book First Impressions, but she was forced to change it when she published it. This is interesting to know because it's kind of a handy way of remembering what Elizabeth and Darcy think of each other. Jane Austen is known for her dry wit and sparkling dialogue, and this is arguably one of her most famous lines, so you should probably know it. It's also an interesting line because you get the sense that Jane Austen, herself, doesn't really believe that it's true (it definitely wouldn't be 'universal,' so that tips us off). But her characters do, so she's inhabiting their voice right off the bat in the opening of the book. This is something that's called free indirect discourse because she's expressing the thoughts and words of her characters, but she's not directly signaling it. She uses this all the time in the book, but it's really prominent in this opening sentence. Luckily for them, Mr. Bingley actually likes one of their daughters, Jane, who's the oldest one. They end up hanging out and dancing a lot at this neighborhood ball, which they seem to have a lot of in this book. Bingley has brought along with him his even richer friend, Mr. Darcy, and he tries to set him up with Elizabeth at this same ball. Darcy's kind of a tool at first. So, Bingley's like, 'You should hook up with Elizabeth,' and Darcy's like, 'No. But like in all romantic comedies, they begin to grow on each other. Darcy, eventually, acknowledges that Elizabeth is pretty and that she's actually really smart and fun to be around. There are, actually, a lot of people in the book who do not want this to happen and are actively (and inactively) trying to stop it. We're going to go over some of those people now; they're kind of the main antagonists in this book. Bingley's sisters really want him to settle down with someone of much higher social status. They've picked out Mr. Darcy's younger sister, Georgiana. She's 16, so that's a little ehh, but that's how they rolled back then. Bingley's single sister, Caroline, really wants this to happen. She has the hots for Darcy, so she wants her brother to marry his sister, so she can have a better chance with him. We'll just go with it. So, Bingley's sisters don't want him to marry Jane, and they have someone else picked out for Darcy. She's Darcy's aunt, and she's kind of old and cranky and nasty, and she's awful. Another person who is getting in the way of Elizabeth's marriage is Mr. Collins. Mr. Collins is Mr. Bennet's cousin, and he's actually the rightful heir to the estate (remember the entail prevents the daughters from inheriting it). He actually proposes to Elizabeth, sort of as a gesture of 'We'll keep this in the family.' But he's super annoying and weird, and she denies his proposal. She still isn't into Darcy, but she's like 'No. So, those are the people who are actively trying to mess things up. The rest of the Bennet family inactively messes things up. They don't have a lot of money, so people don't want their sons to marry into their family. But they're also kind of terrible and embarrassing - all of them. Mr. Bennet's okay; he sort of stays out of things. He's nice, but he doesn't really take action. Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth and Jane's mom, is obnoxious, a hypochondriac; she's really embarrassing and doesn't realize it. She's always trying to show off with these 'accomplishments', like she plays the piano really badly. Kitty, another sister, is all right but kind of boring; you forget about her. She ends up eloping with a soldier and bringing all kinds of shame on the family. Despite all of these things, Elizabeth and Darcy do end up falling in love with each other. She starts to think, by seeing his house, that Darcy might actually not be a proud, rich tool but maybe someone who's kind of nice with bad social skills to deal with. To run through it real quick: In the end, the Bennets are happy. Bingley's sisters are kind of upset because Bingley married Jane, and Darcy didn't marry Caroline; he married Elizabeth.

Mr. Bennet reveals that he has already paid his respects to Mr. Bingley and that they all shall meet soon. At a neighborhood ball, Mr. Bingley makes his first appearance, along with his two sisters\u2014the married Mrs. Hurst and the unmarried Caroline\u2014and his best friend, Mr. Darcy. While Darcy\u2019s wealth makes him the subject of much gossip at the gathering, his brusque, arrogant manner quickly sours the whole company on him. Mr. Bingley shares a mutual and immediate attraction with Jane. Mr. Darcy, on the other hand, is not so impressed. Although she laughs about it with her friend Charlotte Lucas, Elizabeth is wounded by the comment. Mr. Bingley's sisters invite Jane to visit them at Netherfield. Thanks to the machinations of Mrs. Bennet, Jane gets stuck there after journeying through a rainstorm and becomes ill. During their stay, Mr. Darcy begins to develop a romantic interest in Elizabeth (much to his own annoyance), but Caroline Bingley is interested in Darcy for herself. Caroline is particularly irritated that the object of Darcy's interest is Elizabeth, who doesn\u2019t have equal wealth or social status. Caroline endeavors to eliminate Darcy's interest in Elizabeth by speaking negatively about her. By the time the girls return home, Elizabeth\u2019s dislike for both Caroline and Darcy has only grown. Mr. Collins, an obsequious pastor and distant relative, comes to visit the Bennets. Despite not being a close relation, Mr. Collins is the designated heir of the Bennet's estate, as the Bennets have no sons. Mr. Collins informs the Bennets that he hopes to \u201cmake amends\u201d by marrying one of the daughters. Nudged by Mrs. Bennet, who is certain that Jane will soon be engaged, he sets his sights on Elizabeth. Elizabeth, however, has other ideas: namely George Wickham, a dashing militiaman who claims that Mr. Darcy cheated him out of a parsonage he had been promised by Darcy\u2019s father. Although Elizabeth dances with Darcy at the Netherfield ball, her loathing is unchanged. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy and Caroline Bingley convince Mr. Bingley that Jane does not return his affections and encourage him to leave for London. Mr. Collins proposes to a horrified Elizabeth, who rejects him. On the rebound, Mr. Collins proposes to Elizabeth's friend Charlotte. The following spring, Elizabeth goes to visit the Collinses at Charlotte\u2019s request. Mr. Collins brags about the patronage of the nearby great lady, Lady Catherine de Bourgh\u2014who also happens to be Mr. Darcy\u2019s aunt. Lady Catherine invites their group to her estate, Rosings, for dinner, where Elizabeth is shocked to find Mr. Darcy and his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam. Elizabeth\u2019s unwillingness to answer Lady Catherine\u2019s prying questions does not make a good impression, but Elizabeth learns two important pieces of imformation: Lady Catherine intends to make a match between her sickly daughter Anne and her nephew Darcy, and Darcy has mentioned saving a friend from an ill-advised match\u2014that is, Bingley and Jane. Much to Elizabeth's shock and fury, Darcy proposes to her. The following day, Darcy gives Elizabeth a letter containing his side of the story. The letter explains that he genuinely believed Jane to be less in love with Bingley than he was with her (though her family and status did play a role, he admits apologetically). More importantly, Darcy reveals the truth of his family\u2019s history with Wickham. Wickham was a favorite of Darcy\u2019s father, who left him a \u201cliving\u201d (a church posting on an estate) in his will. Instead of accepting the inheritance, Wickham insisted that Darcy pay him the value in money, spent it all, came back for more, and, when Darcy refused, tried to seduce Georgiana, Darcy\u2019s teenage sister. Months later, Elizabeth\u2019s aunt and uncle, the Gardiners, offer to bring her along on a trip. They end up touring Pemberley, Mr. Darcy's home, but are assured that he is away from home by the housekeeper, who has nothing but praise for him. Darcy makes an appearance, and despite the awkwardness of the encounter, he is kind to Elizabeth and the Gardiners. He invites Elizabeth to meet his sister, who is excited to meet her. Their pleasant encounters are short-lived, as Elizabeth receives news that her sister Lydia has eloped with Mr. Wickham. She hurries home, and Mr. Gardiner tries to assist Mr. Bennet in tracking the couple down. News soon arrives that they have been found and are to be married. Everyone assumes that Mr. Gardiner paid Wickham off to marry Lydia instead of abandoning her. When Lydia returns home, however, she lets slip that Mr. Darcy was at the wedding. Mrs. Gardiner later writes to Elizabeth and reveals that it was Mr. Darcy who paid off Wickham and made the match. Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy return to Netherfield and pay a call on the Bennets. At first, they are awkward and leave quickly, but then return almost immediately, and Bingley proposes to Jane. The Bennets receive another unexpected visitor in the middle of the night: Lady Catherine, who has heard a rumor that Elizabeth is engaged to Darcy and demands to hear that it is not true and never will be true. He proposes again, and this time Elizabeth accepts as they discuss the mistakes that finally got them to this point. Mr. Darcy asks Mr. Bennet\u2019s permission for the marriage, and Mr. Bennet gives it willingly once Elizabeth reveals to him the truth of Darcy\u2019s involvement with Lydia\u2019s marriage and of her own changed feelings for him.", "hit_ratio": 2.6036036036036037}], "3": [{"doc_text": "Ugly rumors, whispered secrets, and embarrassing comments start to spread like wildfire at school among 8- and 9-year-olds. \u201cKids this age use gossip to experiment with how much power and influence they have over others,\u201d explains Karin S.

Katie, aged 5, asks to go outside. From across the grass, at the base of the oak tree, the first light quietly winks. Katie and her two-year-old sister, Emily, stare, transfixed. Back in our New Mexico home, the arid night sky is equally as empty of lightning bugs as biting bugs. Suddenly Katie, her short hair bobbing, bounds down the steps onto the lawn followed by a wide-eyed Emily. By now dozens of fireflies have appeared, punctuating the twilight with pricks of phosphorescence. Katie darts after several at the end of the lawn, while Emily, more single-minded, pursues a solitary flash of light near the calla lilies. She approaches patiently, her right arm extended, not catching the firefly so much as letting it catch her. Slowly it alights on her index finger, and an expression of awe and delight breaks across her face. To someone unfamiliar with fireflies, a first appearance is no less astonishing than a unicorn's. Her arm outstretched, she ferries the blinking creature across the lawn and holds it before my eyes. Together we watch it reconnoiter her finger, illumine the skin dazzlingly in yellow light, then lift its wings to sail into the dark. My wife's grandparents, having followed the scene through the living room window, now have stepped outside on the porch, bringing with them a small glass jar. They pass it to Katie with the gentle admonition to trap lightning bugs, but briefly. Before long, the jar harbors a dozen crawling denizens, their bursts of light briskly irradiating the glass container. Katie and Emily gaze down into the glow, their faces as incandescent as the two girls' in John Singer Sargent's ``Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose,'' caught on canvas as they peered into paper lanterns during summer twilight.

Silhouetted elements in the middle ground and foreground enhance the lighter tones in the sky. Blues, purples, and oranges provide color contrast and the strengthen the illusion of light in the background - the \"star of the show\". This requires the artist to be patient as the painting develops, gradually adjusting as each layer is applied. Some beginners make the mistake of ending the layering process far too early, discouraged by the look of the subject while in transition. Many pastel papers are textured with a coarse tooth in order to accept many layers of color, so don't be afraid to build up colors as necessary. For this reason, we can make applications over the top of previous applications, covering them completely. The background can be developed completely before addressing the middle ground and lastly, the foreground. In this case, we can start at the top of the paper and work our way downward, layering applications as we go. We start here with a base application of Ultramarine and bits of orange and yellow in the lower portion of the sky. PanPastels are used initially to cover the surface quickly. Over the top, a variety of blues are applied with pastel and blended with a finger. Darker blues are applied at the top of the sky transitioning to lighter blues at the bottom. Layered applications of orange, yellow, and light cream follow in the area of strongest light. In the lower portion of the sky, colors are gently blended with a finger by pulling them horizontally. With initial colors of the sky in place, our focus turns to developing the clouds and the light that they reflect. Beginning with a medium purple, the shapes of the clouds are defined and lightly blended with a finger. In many circumstances, the light originates from above, producing highlights on the top of subjects and shadows underneath them. With a sunset, the light source is a bit more complex. Instead of originating from above, the light often originates from the horizon. The \"Pastel Landscape Mastery\" video course is a comprehensive learning experience designed to provide the student with the most comprehensive approach to drawing landscapes with pastels. We continue to patiently build up applications of light purples, blues, and oranges. Darker grays are applied in shadowed areas of the larger clouds to darken the value and strengthen the value contrast. Applications are gently blended with a finger to ease transitions and to smooth the texture. The light is intensified by additional applications of orange, yellow, and light cream. A few strokes of light cream are applied to indicate a few breaks within the cloud. Since the work is largely about the sky, we'll limit the amount of space devoted to the middle ground and foreground. By placing the horizon in the lower portion of the picture plane, we make certain that the sky remains the main focus. A few marks are added to indicate distant trees, before touches of light and dark yellow-green are applied with a pastel pencil. Purples and pinks are added with horizontal strokes, creating a field of flowers. Stronger marks are applied for flowers closer to the viewer with the same purples and pinks. Using a light touch with a black pastel pencil, the trunk and branches of the tree are defined. Small circular strokes are applied for the leaves over the outer edges of each branch. Light yellow-green is used to add a bit of color, softening the strength of the black. Additional strong applications of orange are added to the bottom of the clouds to complete the image.", "hit_ratio": 1.2072072072072073}], "2": [{"doc_text": "After fifty-five years of marriage, she was tired of the same ole same old, so she began hormone revitalization, had invitro fertilization and gave birth to a baby girl at the age of seventy.

Grandmother stood on the balcony, wind yanking at her straggling silver hair and fiery eyes looking out, beyond the horizon. Her black dress and laced hat wrinkled slightly in the breeze, echoing the lines on her haggard face. Grandmother looked down at the curved metal railing, and at the taut skin on her claw-like hands. Her voice cracked as she spoke, a million and one thoughts croaking out in that one sentence, a million and one regrets. She remembered herself. A tall young woman, caramel hair soft and flowing, down over her shoulders and flicking up and out at her hips, like a silken waterfall. Her nose lay dainty and perfect in her face, and her flaming golden eyes stood proudly out in her sparkling china skin. She wore green dresses, knee-length and fluttering as she walked with her head held high, proudly showing herself to the world. Grandmother shocked herself when her heels turned her around, back to face the door of the balcony. Her bedroom was beyond it, and inside her bedroom, a patterned curtain draped over something. In the corner, just a curtain. The curtain was thick, flowery patterns wearing away over time, yet the sheet had been untouched for years. Grandmother found herself in her bedroom. She faced the curtain. Her skin felt rough and tired, loose and frail to the touch of anyone but herself. She held her own hand and all she felt was warmth and softness. She always has been the young woman, sprightly and free, and ever so beautiful. A breeze came in through the open door and her heart thumped itself along in its tired way. She heard the warmth leak out of her body and seep into the world around her. As she breathed in, she struggled for air - the air she did get tasted stale and overused. The mirror hid under the curtain, begging for light. She had not changed in 40 years - she wasn\u2019t sure whether she had managed to convince herself of it yet. If she thought she was young and beautiful, would she not be? Her son was her own reflection. He was like her, and his passing at 25 left him preserved forever in his beauty. \"I am beautiful.\" She said, and tore away the curtain.

A tear trickled down from the corner of her eye, slowly running down the creases of her skin and into her ear. She smiled wryly at the warm sensation. Sunlight spilled through semi-closed curtains, muted by the veils of voile that hung from the rail. Dust motes danced in the summer breeze drifting through the high open window. The sound of birdsong took her back to days gone by, of days when the sun shone, days when she flirted, and teased, and lived \u2018til twilight fell and stars glittered in the sky. Even the subdued rays teasing her window reminded of nights beneath moonlight, nights of passion, nights of love, and nights embraced in warm arms. Those days, and nights, were long gone, and so were the people who\u2019d inhabited them with her. Now, she reclined in solitude upon crisp white sheets, soft pillows, and surrounded by the fragrance of orange blossom from the vase upon her night stand. No one visited any longer except nurses, who were dutiful, and friendly, and engaging, but none were family, none mattered beyond the essentials. She listened to the whispering breeze curling around the mock orange outside, lifting the scent to join the foliage in her room. Beneath her dry, closed eyelids her eyes itched, and her nose whistled as she breathed. A limp curl of snow-white hair fell across her brow and tickled her furrowed forehead. Her throat rattled, and despite the nurses\u2019 regular attention, her parched mouth gasped. Alys placed a frail hand on her chest, gently stroking the lace beneath her fingers, then letting her palm rest still. Her heartbeat pulsed, slowly, steadily \u2013 like the rhythm of an evening cricket\u2019s chirrup. She pulled lightly at the ribbons holding her nightgown closed, and they slid away from the bow the night nurse had made. Pale, papery skin threaded with lilac, purple, and blue veins sat across bones that protruded beneath their fragile shroud. Alys reached down towards her heart, feeling gently along her delicate, cool flesh, until her fingers stopped at warm metal. A weary smile curved her lips, and her fingers smoothed over the bronze metal plate that sat over her heart. She lifted a thin tab and withdrew a small key. The key was intricate, ornate, and truly beautiful, and she held it between her fingers with true reverence and gratitude. Coronary lockets they called them, with a narrow door and an interior mechanism that worked with biology and clockwork movement. She\u2019d outlived everyone she cared about, and now was her time. She placed her hands back upon her chest, closed her eyes, and listened to the birdsong at her window. Orange blossom filled her senses, and her mouth lolled slightly open. Her chest rose and fell, and her heartbeat began to slow. Alys felt the sun roll across her and as its warmth finally dissipated, her heart whirred, and jarred, and stopped. Alys was finally where she wanted to be.

Amongst the chocolates and the flowers and all the other stuff in the shops this week, there didn\u2019t seem to be much reflection on the profound nature of motherhood. In the Gospels, the story of the experiences of the Blessed Virgin Mary cuts to the heart of anyone who says they are a Christian. The story of the crucifixion places Mary a few yards from the Cross. If the story of Mary is followed through the Gospels her heart must have been broken as she stood there at Calvary. As Mary stood there at Calvary, those words would have gone through her head again and again.\u201dHis kingdom will never end\u201d, how could this be? How could such words, such hope, end at this place of death? \u201cBlessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear!\u201d Mary must have wept at the memories of those happy days when she looked at the terrible sight before her. Mary would have remembered the night he was born: no fine lodging, but a dirty stable in a strange city; the visits by the strangers to see the child; the ride down into Egypt to preserve her new son\u2019s life. When they had gone to the Temple when Jesus was forty days old he had said, \u201cThis child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be spoken against, so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce your own soul too.\u201d The sword pierced deep into Mary\u2019s soul as she stood there at Golgotha, the place of the skull. Mary would have thought back on the moments of astonishment, the moments when the wonder of Jesus was revealed: the time in Jerusalem when he was twelve years old, when they left the city without him and had returned days later to find him deep in discussion with the most learned men of the land; the wedding at Cana of Galilee when the wine ran out. There were even moments when she thought he had gone too far, the time that she and his brothers had gone to bring him home. Mary stood there hour upon hour, listening to the voices around her; the cries of pain, the shouts and the curses from the crowd and the soldiers. Mary stood and watched and listened.The disciple whom we believe to be John, the Gospel writer, stood there with her. They could do nothing, they could say nothing.In his agony, Jesus looks at her and says to her, \u201cDear woman, here is your son,\u201d and to John he says, \u201cHere is your mother.\u201d And from that time on, John took Mary to his own home. No-one would want to witness such a dreadful execution, yet Mary is prepared to go and stand at Calvary, perhaps she could do nothing but she would not leave Jesus to die alone, she would not desert him. Even if everyone else had gone, she would have still stood there. Jesus knows what great love his mother has for him and has great love for her. She has remained faithful right to the end and, in the middle of these events which are going to change the world, he is anxious she is cared for. Mary\u2019s heart would have been broken, her soul cut through, but she stands there because she loves Jesus.

The noise in an empty room can cause the mind to become conscious of a touch on the shoulder, a whisper of the breeze or the movement of a curtain. Ruskington Manor had its secrets, the empty house played host to spirits on a halfway journey, but when two worlds collide there can only be one outcome. He watched as it washed the ground, rippling across the cobbled streets in rivulets. The sound of his footfall was lost in the whispering sound of the rain and the blur of the narrow street and buildings disappeared into the darkness as the boy headed towards the manor in the distance. The house was silent in the darkness, its brick chimneys ghostly silhouettes on the skyline. The black windows were foreboding, and the thick front door unwelcoming to visitors. Ruskington Manor lay at the end of a gravel drive amongst shadowy trees. Scrambling towards the fading walls, they hid its past behind red brick and thick foliage. The small glow of a lantern shone like a beacon through a window on the upper floor as the boy raised his hand, rattling his knuckles against the damp door. The hinges squealed quietly as the door swung open into the entrance hall. The boy peered into the darkness as an uneasy breeze blew from the shadows within. Glancing upwards, an amber glow meandered towards the stairwell, drawing him towards an open door on the floor above. A gentle touch on the shoulder guided him towards the stairs and the flickering light above. He watched the shadows dancing on the walls and listened to the echo of doors creaking in the gloomy corners of the building. A sudden change in temperature chilled him to the bone and he was pulled into the darkness, alone. It was a crisp white afternoon and she couldn't wait to explore the house. The removal van was parked outside and her parents were busy unloading the furniture into the house. \"I'll go in and open all of the doors.\" Gracie said enthusiastically taking the heavy set of keys. \"Wait for Charlotte.\" her mother called as she ran towards the door. Every room had a peculiar scent, but this one had a subtle odour, a smell she recognised as home. This was safe and reliable, everything she had ever known. The front door was wide open so Gracie walked along the hallway, passing each door as she searched for the right key to open it. When she had completed the ground floor, she made her way upstairs to the bedrooms above, working her way past the bathroom until she came to the last door on the right. She put the key into the door and paused. There was no real reason for her to go into that room; no reason to disturb it. Several boxes were stacked in the hallway, and clumps of snow lay across the floor discarded from heavy boots. Gracie looked out of the window; the snow was so thick she could hardly see across the garden. \"We might as well wait it out; we'll unpack the boxes in the hallway and rearrange some of the furniture.\" \"The furniture in the lounge, it was your great aunts.\" Gracie pulled a face and walked through the double oak doors facing opposite. Gracie could hear her mother moving around in the hallway, lifting and moving boxes across the floor. The darkness crept in quickly, the blizzard squeezing every inch of natural light from the passing day, and the lounge was the only space blessed with light as the house fell into dusty darkness. The warmth from the fire filled the room and the flickering flames bounced from the ceiling to the floor in a bright orange glow. The muffled sound of laughter spilled into the empty corridors, struggling with the darkness. It failed, dying miserably away in the gloom. David Bellamy had a collection of poor jokes and bad stories which he took great pleasure in relating beside the fire, and as the room erupted into laughter, the sound soared above their heads into the darkened hallways, stirring the dust until it retreated to its quiet post. The heavy chime of a grandfather clock echoed through the empty space as Gracie's father stepped forward to examine it in the dim light. As the clock struck midnight, he checked his watch but the night was still young and the visibility zero outside. With the storm worsening, the Bellamy family settled down for the night and waited until morning. Gracie was like any other teenager, inquisitive, disruptive and prone to rebellious outbursts. Walking around the mansion in the pitch black seemed far more exciting than camping out in the lounge during a blizzard. The rooms lay empty with nothing but greying cobwebs spun by inquisitive spiders hanging from the corners, and the echo of voices and footfall fell heavily on the bare floors. As she walked around the corridors, she became more aware of the house and its space. Every room had its nooks and crannies, and every wall had its shadows, they either fell across the floor or climbed the walls. The lumpy mass that followed her every step was her own shadow, moving with the diffused winter light, and every spark was a doorknob until she came to the door to the attic. Gracie had seen no reason to open it earlier and as she glanced behind her, she didn't give the lumpy shape a second thought. The following morning, heavy snowfall had left a covering at least two feet deep and the family spent an hour clearing the path for the move to complete. \"This is just the beginning,\" David said, agitated \"it's going to get a lot worse\"\nThe Bellamy's couldn't have chosen a worse time to move house. They hastily moved box after box through the driving snow alongside furniture and suitcases loaded to the brim. Occasionally, a spatter of brilliant sunshine sparkled off the whitewashed ground, but the rolling clouds returned, showering everything with heavy snowfall. The tumbling flakes drifted lazily from the skies until the wind changed direction, hurling the snow relentlessly to the ground. She could hear the sound of her mother's voice ruthlessly dictating what should be kept and what should be thrown out, failing to recognise the heirlooms still standing in some of the rooms. Above the noise, the radio crackled, struggling for a signal in the stormy weather. The forecast was grim with more snow expected to fall in the coming days. The fire crackled merrily in the grate, and as the family busied themselves to keep warm, the storm arrived with ferocity shaking the house with its painful moans. he said with a meaningful expression. \"The telling of ghost stories.\" Maybe it was the way it was said, or maybe the wind had finally found a chink in the house, whatever it was made Gracie and her mother shiver as David Bellamy launched into a tale of a headless spectre, made all too real by the groaning of the wind outside. Gracie was sitting in the seat closest to the door. She suddenly became aware of the cold empty space behind her that seemed to cringe into the darkness. As her father came to the end of the gruesome tale, his voice seemed more hushed than ever, and Gracie had to strain her ears to pick up the words, the more she tried the more impossible it became. She suddenly felt cut off from everyone else; pulled further into the darkness, until the shadows released their hold. When Gracie went to bed, the sound of footsteps followed her upstairs, one set, two sets, her own set, .and then another. The fourth set of steps persisted where the others had disappeared. She climbed into bed, covering her head with the heavy duvet. Her eyes darted here and there without resting on a single spot until the darkness took over, and she fell almost reluctantly into a deep sleep. Gracie opened the bathroom door and stepped inside. The room was dominated by a claw foot bathtub with gnarled iron legs jutting out at an angle. They clasped the floor like misshapen paws, and Gracie imagined them scuttling out of the bathroom when her back was turned. A mirror hung over the washbasin, and as she walked across the floor, she could see the bath reflected in its misty glass. She gazed slowly around the room and then peered expectantly over the side of the bath. It was empty, no shadowy shape lay in the depths and yet, she had the strangest sensation that she was being watched. \"I bet you a penny you can't make it to the top of the stairs.\" she called as the sound of footsteps disappeared along the hallway. Gracie peered out onto the landing, her eyes wide in horror as the sweet smell of hay and freshly cut grass drifted from the bathroom. The moment her foot touched the landing, she heard a rapping noise above her head. Curious, she followed the slow rap! Footsteps echoed across the dusty floor as a shadow moved in the corner of the room, passing over cobwebs hanging from the ceiling. She blinked once, twice, but the shadow remained still, opaque but with form; child-like but smaller than either she or Charlotte. A hushed silence fell across the room, and in a moment of terror she leaped from the attic and ran down the staircase as the door closed noisily behind her. She ran along the landing until she reached the staircase to the ground floor, and then bounded down the stairs towards the kitchen. Don't be ridiculous, we buried her month's ago.\" she replied. \"Just what I said, she's back, and if it isn't her it's somebody else!\" Her bones still ached from the journey through the portal. Nothing seemed to be straightforward. Life was such a bind, and she had the noisy residents to contend with. She shuffled her feet and looked around the room. The attic was such as mess, and that servant boy had been in the house for centuries; if only she knew where he was. Iris and William Bellamy lived at Ruskington Manor for sixty years, inheriting the house and garden from Sir James Bellamy, the fourth Duke of Ruskington. Iris was ninety-four when she passed through the portal to the spirit world. The decaying manor was placed in trust for her niece Charlotte, in the hope that it would be brought back to its former glory, minus the previous occupants; but something had gone terribly wrong and they were all stuck. Iris had no idea that Ruskington Manor had a resident ghost, until Christmas Eve nineteen eighty-five when a series of peculiar events led to the revelation of a gambling debt in the Bellamy household. Every morning he sat on the top step of the staircase close to the Duke of Ruskington's private rooms waiting for his daily orders, one of which was invariably to spy on fellow members of the Duke's gambling ring. One cold winter's night, the boy mysteriously disappeared after settling a debt with a local businessman, and for over a century the manor had played host to the boy's mischievous spirit. He appeared beside her husband before tripping the butler as he stepped away from the dinner table. She tried to ignore him, but his antics became such a nuisance that she called the parish priest in the hope that he would send him away. Now that Iris had passed to the spirit world herself, she was determined to find him. She gazed out of the window at the falling snow. The winter had set in early. The overgrown trees were almost invisible, and their sprawling branches creaked under the weight of snow and ice. It would soon be Christmas, and that stupid servant boy would be tampering with the lights again. She sighed heavily and the sound of her breath sent a spider scurrying across a web. Nothing had gone according to plan, and the transition hadn't been as easy as she thought. She couldn't understand it; she'd planned everything meticulously to the last, yet here she was, still peering through a window. Iris watched as the cold air froze the surface of the glass, scattering tiny patterns into the corners of the window frame. The garden looked horrendous and the house was even worse. The view to the stables was lost and the statues had been stolen years ago. Gracie and Charlotte crept along the landing towards the bathroom. The chilly air caught their breath in tiny clouds, and the creaking floorboards echoed in the empty space. The doors were closed against the winter cold, and Gracie eyed the handles warily as they moved along the landing. Gracie replied. \"Well, the smell was in the bathroom and the chair was in the attic!\" She peered around the bathroom door. The room was empty. No shadows, just the large Victorian bath in the centre and the misty mirror on the wall. Charlotte shot a glance across the landing. No shadows on the walls, no creatures lurking; apart from the grisly spiders in the corners. Gracie hissed. The staircase was narrow and winding with one step missing from the full flight. Charlotte listened to the sound of her footsteps, the steady sound slightly off beat by the missing step. She casually brushed away flying cobwebs and reached for the walls to steady her legs. The walls were covered in ancient cracked plaster, escaping decoration in the floral print of the other rooms. The falling shadows masked the end of the stairway and she turned and walked back down, leaving the offbeat sounds behind. Charlotte hadn't even gone through the attic door and Gracie hadn't noticed the missing step when she had climbed the stairs earlier. Gracie opened her mouth in surprise and then watched her sister stomp noisily down the landing. The doorknobs twitched with every step, and by the time she had reached the top of the stairs, the whole landing echoed with rattles and moans of the wind. The bathroom door closed with a click, the noise unheard by Charlotte who swept noisily down to the kitchen. Gracie held her breath and then rushed past the bathroom. She halted at the top of the stairs as the sound of laughter drifted across the landing. Gracie watched wide-eyed as it poured over the side of the banister and spilled onto the floor below. A flash of fur dashed by her legs and disappeared into the shadows, and, convinced it was a rat, she stepped slowly, placing one foot at a time on the stairs until she reached the bottom. The shadow remained, hovering just above floor level until a disembodied arm took a swipe at an empty box. The sound of scraping cardboard quickly fell silent and Gracie's eyes started as a small figure darted towards the front door. Later that morning, the sockets in the manor began to lose power and the half-baked cannelloni in the microwave remained half-baked as David Bellamy tweaked at the old fuse box in the kitchen. As soon as he pulled, something pushed and the house was plunged into darkness amongst flying sparks and smoke. Upstairs in the drawing room, Olivia Bellamy straightened a portrait of the fourth Duke and then returned to the kitchen to test the sockets. As the door closed, the playful apparition stepped from the shadows and moved the portrait to the left again. Unseen footsteps strolled around the room, studying the orderly chaos of jumbled furniture and photographs. There was something about the woman Olivia the shadow couldn't quite put his finger on it. The others were Bellamy's, that was clear to see, but the woman was different, puzzling. She was astute with figures, organised, practical and demanding. The Duke's generally managed their own finances, which unfortunately had been the reason for the decline in the manor. That was exactly the reason why he was still here over a century later organising the Duke's affairs, or not. Alistair moved towards the window and looked out at the overgrown branches peering through the snow. The gravelled drive no longer swept to the gated entrance, and the once majestic trees scrambled awkwardly across the lawns. Their thorny arms reached across the windows, smothering every ounce of daylight from the sky. He was bound and questioned about the affairs of Ruskington Manor, but his loyalty to the Duke was stronger than the concern for his own life. His untidy appearance had sent him into a head-on collision with a passing footman, and when he stole his uniform, the shadows no longer offered him the shelter he needed to haunt the decaying pile. Iris passed into the scullery. The old butler sink was stained and she was tempted to turn on the taps and give it a good scrub, but it was pointless. All she could do was hover about in the hope of finding Alistair. The clock struck three in the hallway. She so hated it when David called it the lounge. The Duke's portrait had always hung in the drawing room, not the lounge. She tutted impatiently, sailing through the door as Olivia appeared from the kitchen. He wondered if any of the others had the gift. He drifted down the landing towards the Duke's study and disappeared through the door. The faded curtains hung loosely at the window and as he paced up and down above the threadbare carpet, the material billowed like a sail in the breeze. Stepping into the Dukes private rooms was a privilege for any servant, more so for Alistair. The stable boy had been jettisoned to the position of page servant and had rapidly become a trustworthy aid and messenger. Life on the other side of the tracks had opened him up to wealth and greed he could only ever have dreamed of. His life had been humble until he was plucked from the dilapidated cottage he shared with his family and taken to Ruskington Manor to work as a stable boy. He slept in the hayloft, tended the horses during the day, prepared the carriages and saddled the hunters for visiting guests. The position of page servant had been a step up to a better life, had it not been for Hemingway and his men. Alistair drifted around the room gently touching the furnishings with his fingertips before disappearing into the folds of material on the window. Drifting from room to room was so pointless, her skills hadn't developed properly and she was no more a spirit than an empty glass of air. The sound of laughter came from somewhere down the hall. She stepped forward hovering once again past the billiard room until she reached the drawing room. The study door was open and the floor was littered with books. The music room was silent, and the sound of breaking glass came from the direction of the conservatory. Iris paid little attention to the noise and moved purposely towards the laughter, poking her head through the panels on the door. Iris still hadn't mastered the electrics in the manor. Moving things around was relatively easy, but anything to do with the sockets and fuses was beyond her scope for the time being at least. Always causing problems at dinner parties and trashing the family tree at Christmas, and she was deeply suspicious of the shrinking levels of gin in the drinks cabinet. He was capable of most of the spooky tasks at the manor and it was only right to assume that he was the secret ghostly tippler. If she couldn't locate Alistair by then, the entire house would be filled with spirits of every kind, one chasing the other. Iris decided to pay her a visit. The Bellamy's were seated close to the fire. Alistair had moved from the Duke's private rooms to the floor below and had been sitting quietly in the corner watching the two sisters. He felt a tinge of sadness; the girls were roughly the same age as he was the day he passed into the spirit world. Charlotte contemplated throwing the vase back when the door flew open and the smell of stale gin drifted into the room. He waited, but the figure neither spoke or acknowledged his presence, they were merely concerned about the vase floating above the Bellamy's heads. The disembodied feet shuffled to and fro as a pair of arms waved frantically until the vase nose-dived into Gracie's lap. The Bellamy's held their breath as a shuffle of feet brought the figure to a standstill. Clearly invisible, Alistair let out a gentle cough followed by a deep gasp. The blast of air sent the flames in the hearth spiralling up the chimney. The slippered figure turned around oblivious to Alistair stepping out of the shadows. Gracie stared down at the vase, her eyes wide in alarm. Ghosts had never been her thing and living in a house with a floating resident wasn't very appealing. Olivia Bellamy was different in the shadows. The hollow of her eyes accentuated the length of her nose and there was something about the way she stood that startled Alistair. The library door shook as he passed along the hallway to the kitchen flicking at lights and tapping windows until he reached the passage to the stairs. He felt alienated from the familiar darkness and a sudden surge of anger sent a shiver through the servant's bells as he turned into the scullery. Olivia drew the curtains across the window, locking out the blackness of the night. The bitter cold trapped every ounce of moisture and icy patterns lay across the window, unbroken by the heat of the fire. Charlotte watched the flames dancing in the grate as her father poked the hot coals. Alistair's darkening mood had sent a flurry of vibrations through the manor, disturbing furniture and rippling threadbare carpets. Her close-set eyes made her nose look too long and the way her hair fell over her shoulders made her face appear cloaked, hidden behind the low fringe and thick waves. He moved around the building, an eerie breeze creeping through every door. Photographs lay flat on every surface and as he drifted across the room, his eyes opened wide in despair. The unmistakable resemblance was there, in the eyes, the nose and the mouth. The soft fall of the hair, the dark blue clothing. The expression was kind and the smile reassuring, but there was no mistake, or was there? The paper gently billowed to the floor as the pages moved with unseen hands. He swung around as the footman breezed into the room followed by Barnaby the stable cat. He glanced at Alistair with an air of indifference and scattered the fallen paperwork across the floor as he passed through the wall on his way to the games room. The drawing room was a dishevelled mess with upturned furniture and paper strewn across the floor. With the twitch of a finger, the draws of a writing desk flew open spilling out the contents. Satisfied with the chaos, Alistair followed the footman through the wall as a pair of books quietly left a shelf and rose towards the ceiling. Barnaby watched as they danced on the breeze casting shadows in the moonlight, and then pounced silently across the room, his tail dusting the door frame as he left. Iris Bellamy floated motionless above the floor of the drawing room. Oh well\"\nShe moved across the room to the fireplace and glanced upwards towards the mirror. She couldn't see a thing in the mirror apart from the reflection of the curtains on the window, and then it suddenly occurred to her that ghosts don't have reflections. She spun around cutting through the edge of the mantelpiece with the tip of her shoulder. The sudden movement sent a flurry of sparks up the chimney and she stepped into the shadows in search of Alistair. David, things are moving about in the house, I don't call that harmless!\" send her an email or get the girls to WhatsApp the lot of them! Well, maybe that's the reason they're all hanging about, they want to keep the old pile for themselves.\" A door opened and the sound of footsteps disappeared down the hallway. \"Right, get the girls; we're going on a ghost hunt!\" David said gleefully rubbing his hands together. The family moved quietly through the house. Shoulder to shoulder they shuffled in the darkness, guided only by a small torch light. The narrow beam danced across the walls, searching quiet corners and doorways for movement as anxious eyes peered into the gloom, knowing that the bumps of the night were not the central heating. The Bellamy's started on the top floor close to the servant's quarters with its wooden floors and bare iron bedsteads, each one trying their best to feel something in its dark corners. Oddly, Olivia was the first one to actually feel anything. A drop in temperature sent a shiver down her spine and somewhere in the depths of silence she realised that they were not alone. Without warning, she felt something brush her shoulder. The air was strangely sweet and as she turned, the remains of a chocolate mousse landed on her head and dripped towards her chin. Startled, David shone the torch. The light caught the end of a globule of chocolate and David watched in horror as it balanced precariously on the end of her nose before plopping onto her white fluffy jumper. David reached protectively into the darkness. They moved quickly along the upper floor, alert to the sounds of creaking floors and turning handles. The air was cooler near the servant's rooms with a distinct odour, and the occasional rush of whispered voices. In the diffused light, Alistair clearly saw the face of Miles Hemingway, and there was no mistaking the family tie. He moved quickly ahead passing through the group as they approached the staircase. The cold chill sent spiders scuttling in anticipation across dusty cobwebs, and small orbs of light, barely visible in the gloom, passed from one door to the next. Gracie gasped as they rose and fell in the shadows, weaving their way through the banister to the ground floor where they disappeared though walls and ceilings. Olivia cried as they reached the top of the stairs. Charlotte looked nervously towards the front door. Olivia wiped the remains of the chocolate from her face. \"Voices, and then someone ran through the house so I followed the noise to the attic. Only the door isn't there any more, but it was because I went inside. \"No it was a shape the size of Charlotte.\" Olivia skipped down the stairs closely followed by Gracie and Charlotte as David flicked away cobwebs in the darkness. As the group moved quickly towards the front door, the heads on the family portraits turned after them, watching every move. Gracie reached for the door handle as the sound of the car horn bellowed across the garden, and it's flashing headlights streamed through the dusty windows. The family held their breath and peered into the darkness, wide eyed. \"No,\" David Bellamy gulped \"they're in the bedroom beside the clock.\" Charlotte reached for the light switch beside the door. A loud thud came from somewhere near the library as Iris mastered the art of blowing the electrics in the manor. Overwhelmed by bitterness and anger, he threw himself across the floor sending Olivia to the ground in a crumpled heap. The air became very still as Alistair hovered beside the window. Beams of light from the car headlights caught a smattering of tiny floating particles falling through the air, and in the diffused light, Gracie saw the outline of Alistair's face. His eyes were deep, almost sunken, and his thin lips were fixed in a painful smile. Gracie gasped, helping her mother to her feet. \"A boy, he looks like a servant.\" Alistair breathed heavily, seeking Olivia's attention. The sound of crunching snow distracted the Bellamy's momentarily as a police car pulled to a halt behind the family Volkswagen. David peered through the windows as the officer climbed wearily out of the police car and studied the Volkswagen. The horn was still blaring and the headlights flashed intermittently like a pair of eyes blinking in the daylight. The officer checked the interior of the car and shot a glance at the manor. The single track of tyres in the snow had disappeared under fresh snowfall, and it was clear that the Volkswagen hadn't moved for several hours. In the dim light, David Bellamy's face was pale and gaunt; almost ghost like behind the glass. The police officer eyed the stationary vehicle suspiciously and then turned his attention to the manor. There were no visible footprints apart from his own, and it was clear to him that the Volkswagen was an abandoned getaway car, unless the burglars were trapped inside the empty mansion. He shone his torch at the front door and checked for signs of forced entry. The lock was clean, and there were no signs of splintered wood in the snow. As he reached for the door handle, the face at the window caught his eye. Masked by shadows, the face was full of anguish, and its ghoulish smile sent a momentary shiver down Henry Perkins spine. A halo of mist appeared on the glass, and David looked more menacing than ever. Ruskington Manor had been empty for months; with no sign of activity since Iris Bellamy had passed away. The man at the window was obviously a thief, an incompetent one at that. He returned to the patrol car, requesting assistance from other officers in the area. The struggling signal failed to connect, and the officer was forced to deal with the issue alone. He climbed out of the car and shone his torch at the window. David was still standing in the darkness, his ghostly silhouette fading into the shadows. Henry Perkins glared at the Bellamy's as they crowded around the window, peering into the torchlight. Inside the manor, Alistair had begun to move the furniture in the dining room and Iris was practising her newly acquired skills in the music room, including banging an eerie melody on the piano keys. The haunting sound of music drifted through the quiet hallways filling the empty space. The voice came from the direction of the front door. The Bellamy's turned to see Henry Perkins standing inside the hall. \"Have you got a problem with the electrics then?\" So you just sit in the dark with the doors locked and leave your car headlights on for fun then? Olivia tugged David's sleeve as Henry Perkins appeared in the doorway of the interview room. The Bellamy's walked solemnly into the light blue room and closed the door behind them. The sound of muffled laughter escaped from the room as a well-built officer in a grey suit disappeared through the door carrying a file. Outside the station, the bitterly cold wind whipped through the spiked icicles hanging from the roof, snapping the weakest ones mid length. A ruffle of fallen snow edged its way along the path, stopping at the entrance to the station. The doors breezed open and Alistair stepped into the light. In a haze of mist, it cut through the seating area, hovering momentarily before drifting towards the operations room on the upper floor. The duty constable shuddered as he passed and then glanced at the CCTV screen. He quickly glanced around and then walked towards the door. The world outside was silent and the sky was grey with a hint of fresh snowfall as Alistair floated along the silent corridor, peering through windows and rattling door handles until he reached the door to the operations room. The room was full of flashing screens and ringing bells, and dark figures lurked beside the windows. He passed quickly through the door, knocking over a coat stand on the way in. The stand was heavy, and narrowly missed a filing cabinet when it fell to the floor. Tiny sparks rose from the carpet and a gentle buzzing soon became a loud crack as the main fuse blew in the circuit board. Muxley police station was thrown into darkness and the excitable hub was reduced to a silent whisper. Downstairs in the interview room, chairs shuffled as Officer Perkins ploughed through the door with the Bellamy's to the front desk. By the time they had reached the counter, the backup generator kicked in and the station was flooded with light. \"They're free to go,\" said Henry Perkins \"on the proviso they contact the vicarage!\" The officers watched as the family stepped reluctantly into the darkness, their feet quickly disappearing into the snow. David peered into the darkness as a flurry of snowflakes fell gently to the ground. Olivia stared at the dismal skies \"We can't walk home in this, we'll freeze.\" The sound of an engine pierced the silence as a battered transit van chugged to a halt on the road opposite the station. The family watched as an elderly man in a dressing gown climbed out and lifted the bonnet. A pall of smoke escaped into the air along with the smell of burning rubber, and as the smoke cleared, the man leaned forward and began to pull something out of the engine. After several minutes he returned to the van, leaving the bonnet open. As he climbed into the driver's seat he noticed the family standing in the snow. The van engine had overheated and he would be on his way to the vicarage in no time, but he couldn't possibly leave without offering to help a stranded family. Geoffrey Symington climbed back out of the van and walked very slowly through the deepening snow. His thick fur lined boots kept his feet warm and dry, but the wind soon whipped through his frayed woollen gown. The family were huddled together against the cold and eyed the dilapidated van which was clearly un-roadworthy. Because I'll be happy to give you a lift once Lizzie has cooled down a bit, she's a little overheated at present, but you're more than welcome to sit in the van until she's ready to move.\" Olivia chattered \"Yes, we are stranded and it's too far to walk in the snow.\" she blabbed. \"Please follow me; you'll be much better out of the cold. I'm Geoffrey Symington by the way, the Vicar of St Martins. he replied pulling the van door open, \"Do step in.\" The rusty door struggled for a moment and then closed with an awkward clunk. The van was full of boxes stacked in unruly piles against a wooden bench, and the floor was littered with polystyrene beads. The manor has been part of the ministerial circuit for a number of years, although I've never visited it myself.\" Geoffrey Symington was a likeable character, a little eccentric with a hint of magic. Charlotte's heart leaped. The vicar's appearance was comforting, perfectly timed and the perfect solution. All they had to do was convince him to stay. Lizzie, the junk mobile, was soon moving carefully along the snow bound roads towards the Manor. Olivia was reluctant to return, but in order to leave; they had to return to collect the car. She only hoped that the cheeky little poltergeist hadn't done anything other than tamper with the headlights, and the thought of Gracie having hallucinations was more than she could bear. She pushed her hands deeper into her pockets and crossed her fingers. The thickening snow was unforgiving, and the van crawled, slipped and jolted its way through silent streets, until reaching the desolate road to the manor. The roof line was just visible through the snowy haze and its chimneys appeared through ragged trees reaching for the sky. The gate to the manor was open, held back by freezing snow and ice, and navigating the final stretch of road was difficult without markers. Iris Bellamy was busily trying to rearrange the furniture in the dining room when the van pulled to a halt outside. She'd grown tired of playing the piano and had drifted towards the entrance hall when Alistair plunged through the wall in pursuit of the patrol car. She peered through the window as the van crunched to a halt. The van was barely visible against the snowy backdrop, and when the group emerged, they resembled visiting ghosts from a neighbouring parish. The house seemed strangely inviting as the family filed into the hall. Charlotte had been the first to step out of the van, and waited motionless for the others to join her. Geoffrey Symington smiled at Gracie as she grasped her mother's hand and stumbled towards the house. The distant clattering was less disturbing, and the forbidden corners of the manor seemed to open out in welcome to the rather unconventional visitor as Geoffrey Symington, vicar of St Martin's, stepped into the darkness. The vicar gazed in awe at the high ceilings and sweeping staircase. In the grey light the house looked surreal, with the faded gilding on the picture frames providing a dash of sparkle. Delicate orbs of light danced across the floor like fairy lights in a woody dell. In a magical display of blue and shimmering silver, they darted here and there, rising and falling without fear of discovery from those who believe in other planes of existence. Geoffrey's eyes wandered across the walls to the large mullioned windows and back to the empty fireplace. \"We had a power cut.\" she stammered. \"I see, well I have travel lamp in the car, there's still a bit of juice in it.\" he said peering out of the window. The gentle snow storm was now a blizzard, and the ghostly figure approaching the manor was no more than a whisper in the wind. Geoffrey Symington was seated comfortably by the fire, his shadowy figure spilling across the arms of the chair. His eyes sparkled as he studied his surroundings with interest. The room was warm and comfortably furnished with a scattering of family photographs in various frames. His wizened face was darkened by the dim light, but as daylight broke through the clouds, he took on an almost surreal appearance by the fire. The touch of a breeze flowed through the empty spaces and a glimmer of light danced across the upper floor. Alistair had startled the spirits. The gentle energy of the house was being drawn, almost partitioned, by a negative force with depth and meaning, a dark brooding force intent on destruction. He had a spiritual energy, radiating kindness and compassion without judgement and he sensed that the falling silence wasn't welcoming. The presence of a negative force tipped the balance between magic and the real world, and he was compelled to assist the inhabitants of the manor in any way he could. \"It must be fascinating living in the manor, so much history.\" The kindly old man smiled at Olivia. She was agitated. The stillness was uncomfortable and she was glad of a break in the silence. \"It's centuries old with lots of dark corners and creepy histories.\" she replied. Aunt Iris was floating about completely disembodied and the servant boy was the closest to a poltergeist Gracie had ever seen. As for the rest of them, they could be anywhere at any time, spooking. Gracie's expression could be similar to her grandfather's when the mood took, but there was no mistaking that she was a Bellamy. \"What are you two whispering about.\" she asked. Geoffrey clasped his hands in thought. Olivia was doubtful. She was beginning to wonder if it was all part of an elaborate plan, she hardly dared admit to her grandfather's connection to the manor, but perhaps somebody else had. The room was eerily silent. Charlotte watched as the ashes from the fire fell softly onto the hearth. \"So these spirits have unfinished business with the manor?\" Alistair leaned towards the gentle little man, blowing in his ear, but when he raised a hand to move the armchair it remained fixed to the floor by an invisible force. David was cautious, unwilling and unsure if his words were reaching the unseen through the walls and ceilings above. David watched as the flickering flames began to draw further up the chimney, hissing and spitting their way across the blackened brick. \"Perhaps if we move to the affected areas,\" Geoffrey began \"the areas of activity. Geoffrey tapped the end of his nose and then reached into his pocket pulling out a leather bound book and a small round object very like a clock or compass, with hands pointing to various places on the dial. Geoffrey polished the glass dial with his dressing gown sleeve, studying it intensely. The device was a truth telling instrument that could analyse dreams and create answers to the unknown, the unexplained. It also analysed dust, and the dust in the manor was made from elementary particles of the spirits who remained in its walls. he moved slowly, clutching the book tightly in his hands. Olivia nervously followed Geoffrey through the hallway. She began to wish that she had been more open with David when they met. The old lady had never really taken to her and Olivia had been totally surprised when she had left Ruskington Manor to Charlotte. The trust fund was a bonus too, but if David ever found out that the Hemingway's had tried to take the manor all those years ago, Olivia would lose everything, including the girls. As she wandered through the gloomy hallways, she knew that the house sensed her betrayal. The walls seemed to breathe as the group moved through the quiet building. Charlotte's eyes fell to her feet as pooling water merged and crystallised into a patch of solid white, reflecting splashes of light across its surface. As they reached the open door, the smell of candle wax drifted into the hallway. Gracie cringed at each creak of the oak floor until something flickered in the corner of her eye. Alistair followed close behind, but never quite reaching Olivia who walked behind the girls with David. Several doors opened of their own accord, and the rush of footsteps faded as the Vicar of St Martins approached. Behind him, laughter followed the sound of splintering wood as he reached for the magical little compass in his pocket. Geoffrey watched the needles spin gently to the left, before turning full circle where they hovered, before coming to rest, their points facing the wall. He moved on towards the door leading to the former Duke's private room, where he stopped and studied the readings. Instead he back tracked, ripping through the ground floor, leaving a trail of destruction behind him. and the feathery touch of unseen hands tousled her hair as she trod warily behind the children. Iris poked her head through a panel on the wall. The house was alive with glowing orbs and peculiar smells clinging to the heavy atmosphere, and the footman had been suspended from the ceiling of the morning room for hours. She stepped though the panelling and followed a flickering ray of light through the house until she spotted the Bellamy's huddling together outside the dukes private rooms. She watched the walls come alive with disembodied heads, their necks outstretched like freakish creatures. Raw boned and pinched, they pulled at the air with scraggy arms. The needles on the compass spun anti clockwise, barely stopping on its central pivot. Geoffrey laid the compass across the open pages of the book and watched as the walls became a knotted mass of body parts, all seemingly trying to escape the hold of the ageing bricks. \"Get them out,\" she hissed \"get rid of the lot of them!\" The house began to groan, and the whispering voices became louder, forcing the group to take refuge in the library. Geoffrey waved his arms in the air, catching invisible objects and throwing them through the windows. Charlotte and Gracie watched bemused as his gathering strength quickly gained momentum, and the powerful moans of the house were lost in the screams of the departing spirits. A sudden rush of wind carried a stream of tiny orbs through the window and the garden became a magical world of sparkling light. She waved an arm at a group of spirits emerging from the floor outside the library. Arms reached through the wooden floor with spindly fingers grabbing at the air, touching and feeling like spiders on a web. Alistair's mouth fell open, distorted and twisted like a rubber band, and a loud groan echoed along the hallway. Inside the library, Geoffrey lay slumped in a chair exhausted. Olivia shuddered as the noise from the hallway filtered through the door. Charlotte and Gracie watched in awe as a ribbon of colour swirled across the garden, barely touching the tips of exposed leaves and branches poking through the snow. \"I'm exhausted.\" \"They're leaving\" said Gracie as the ribbon rose to the sky, fading gently into a white cloud. David opened the door, peering into the hallway. Shadowy figures lurked and fingers circled the handle on the door dragging it open with a muffled creak. She was doubtful that anything would work. The walls were full of spooks and ghoulish beings rooted to the foundations. Asking David to throw any of them out was a recipe for disaster, but leaving the manor wasn't an option. The living were more important, and if the resident spooks didn't like it they could argue at a later date. David was alarmed. He couldn't see a thing as he stepped out into the hallway. The chilly air rasped at his throat and the touch of fingers reaching across his face sent a shiver down his spine. He cringed as the floor began to creak and he was tempted to return to the library but Olivia would never forgive him, and the girls would be disappointed if the house remained stubbornly occupied by freakish little creatures. A lone mouse eyed him curiously before scuttling into the shadows, and he found himself tip toeing through the house in search of ugly ghouls and Aunt Iris. They probed his nostrils, creeping through his hair to the nape of his neck and touching his shoulders. That's it! Get out, the lot of you. David screamed. Iris ducked as a spindly arm flew out of the wall followed by a spinning head with a short fat neck. David's eyes had begun to play tricks, and the dusty corners of the house were now full of beady eyes eager to frighten intruders. With each footstep, the house became more hostile, and he was determined to find out why. Gracie asked \"I don't want to live in a creepy house, and we've got nowhere else to go.\" Iris passed through the doorway, closely followed by a pair of crooked little arms which quickly retreated in silence. Outside the library, voices were distant but audible and the freakish ghouls crawled across the floor with bony limbs scraping glass and wood. Minutes later he announced he'd got it, the reason why the manor was haunted was due to nosiness and revenge. \"Yes nosiness, they can't stand the thought of not knowing.\" Alistair's anger wreaked havoc throughout the house and the freaks were refusing to leave. She'd been meaning to pay her a visit, now was as good a time as any. Tell your father to stop messing around and throw him out with the freaks. I'm tired of tripping over them and they're spitting all over the floor!\" The door flew open and a mass of creeping arms slithered across the floor, groping at Olivia's feet. Charlotte grabbed a cushion, frantically beating the floor as the crown of a skull rose through the floorboards under a mass of unruly hair. It spilled across the carpet as the room filled with the smell of rotten eggs. Gracie's eyes widened in alarm as a twisted face poked through the floor, its skin pale and drawn across a head too heavy for its skinny neck. Charlotte swung the cushion violently at the ghoul. He scanned the shelves for the secret tipple and spotted a bottle of tonic water. he cried tossing the bottle to Geoffrey. The room was alive with floating objects filing through the door. Amidst the chaos Iris floated sideways as a heavy book fell from the ceiling. The book narrowly missed Olivia as she frantically reached for the poker in the fireplace. Iris flicked her wrist and the poker lifted into the air, hovering above David's head. Olivia watched as a confused array of books, shoes and saucepans danced across the ceiling. A sudden gust of wind threw the Bellamys to the floor. They cowered as the ghoulish freaks were jettisoned through the walls, their hysterical cries lost in the sound of the wind. The force of the gust pushed Alistair forward, propelling him towards the window. He passed through the glass in a scream of protest and disappeared in a smokey haze. Iris was pinned to the wall, her body half in and half out of the manor with her hands and feet sticking out like knobbled coat hangers. The winter mist hung heavy as the Bellamy's walked through the lych gate of St. Martin's church. A small crowd had gathered inside the church, and there was an air of expectation as the family joined them inside. Olivia flashed a satisfied smile at the congregation. The manor had slipped into tranquillity and its dusty rooms opened out to welcome a new generation of visitors. The unruly inhabitants had gone, and one by one they rose to the sky in a flurry of stars and light. The gruesome spirits were nowhere to be seen, and the family breathed a sigh of relief as the Christmas festivities began. Olivia had set the table for lunch and with the Christmas goose slowly roasting in the oven, the family had set out for morning mass. It had been a peculiar month. The blessing for rescued pets at the Church of Our Lady and the prayer for the dysfunctional goat had sprung out of nowhere; he had no idea how to address an issue with a goat! And the exploding church candle wasn't entirely welcomed either. The pinnacle of success was the matter regarding the manor. His eyes scanned the congregation in the nave. Eager faces beamed up at him from wooden pews decorated with fresh greenery, and the flickering candle danced across the edges of the advent wreath in front of the pulpit. The women's institute had done an excellent job. Candles and bright red poinsettias were dotted about the nave on tables, and a wooden nativity scene welcomed visitors. The aroma of fresh pine and candlewax drifted on a gentle breeze as the heavy oak church door closed on the last arrivals. The service soon progressed to lively carolling with Ding Dong Merrily on High resounding against the stone walls, followed by The First Noel. At twelve thirty, Geoffrey pulled Lizzie to a halt outside the manor. The door opened to the aroma of orange and cinnamon, and the house sparkled from every corner. The creaking door closed with a flourish as he stepped into the hallway. The family portraits twinkled above the open fire and the polished floor gleamed beneath the tree by the window. Huge garlands hung from the staircase and a glistening chandelier threw shafts of delicate light across the walls. The trick of the light seemed to reflect tiny faces in the baubles on the Christmas tree, but the idea of unwanted visitors was soon dismissed as he was shown into the dining room. Ruskington Manor was dressed in winter white and silver with splashes of bright red and fresh foliage from the garden. The light through the windows hit the room at every angle and the glowing fire crackled merrily as David piled on extra logs. Amongst them was a very special gift for the vicar, an antique frame which David had found in a local shop. Olivia's perfect Christmas had been meticulously planned. The rooms were dressed, the table laid, the gifts were flawless and dinner was a complete triumph. No uninvited guests, no inhospitable hosts, the manor was theirs. The girls helped themselves to more goose and Charlotte had an extra portion of roasted vegetables. The manor had been a haven of peace since Geoffrey's visit. No strange noises or bumps in the night, no moving objects, no ugly little freaks. And no Aunt Iris, Olivia's prayers had been answered the night they met in a blizzard. The gift was perfect, Geoffrey collected frames and it was ideal for the watercolour he had in his study. His mind drifted to the forgotten Christmas at the manor when the Dukes footman stumbled across a secret. Geoffrey had been a young man the day he walked up the drive, and somehow the past had called him back to the place where it all began. He sipped at a glass of port and took a bite of the Christmas pudding. David pulled the bolt across the door and turned the key. Christmas had always been his favourite time of the year and he was filled with boyish excitement as soon as the mince pies hit the shelves in the supermarkets. By the time the baubles were out he was swept up in the festivities long before the big day. Sometimes life gets in the way and not every Christmas is the ideal Christmas, but there's something about a late winters day when you're decorating the tree and drinking hot chocolate that creates the perfect end to the day. And when the snow silently falls, the magic really begins. Gathering round the tree on Christmas morning whilst the fire crackles in the fireplace, opening presents and burying the floor waist deep in wrapping paper is what Christmas all about, giving. Lulled into sleep by full stomachs and warm fires, the girls barely moved as their father walked along the hallway to the master bedroom. Olivia was in the kitchen, checking all was in order for Boxing Day. The day had been perfect, prefect presents, a perfect table and the perfect guest loved his perfect gift. She took a last look around the kitchen before walking towards the stairs. The manor was beautiful in the snow. The twinkling lights turned it in to a magical wonderland instead of a stark, desolate building. A flick of a switch threw the hall into darkness, with a dying flame from the fire the only source of light. Olivia climbed the stairs to the bedrooms above. The stairs turned at the second flight and as she placed her foot on the lower step, a door slammed somewhere near the music room. Olivia's eyes opened in alarm and she held her breath as the sound of footsteps echoed down below.", "hit_ratio": 22.411214953271028}], "1": [{"doc_text": "It seemed colossally stupid, standing there among the empty shelves and cobwebs.

I stayed well back and when she stopped in front of a row of card catalogs, the haze slid forward to reincorporate with the rest of her. I went up on tiptoes and peered over the edge, wondering if I was simply at the wrong angle to see what was inside, but all that met my eyes was the bottom of the drawer. The ghost led me up a stairway to a broad mezzanine looking down on the ground floor. Tall windows lined the walls, looking out into heavy fog, its damp grayness beading on the glass. I scurried to catch up. The space between the bookshelves was narrow enough that I would have to back out in order for her to pass me, but before I could move, the ghost slid through my body in a wave of glacial cold laced with the smell of musty paper and book glue. The once-dim library gleamed. Sunlight streamed through the windows. Books filled the shelves, not a trace of dust or a single cobweb in sight. I spun to see the librarian\u2019s silver-laced bun vanish down the stairs to the ground floor. They\u2019d been torn apart for scrap long ago, the marble, hardwood, and glass repurposed in the new world. I pulled the nearest title into my hands and opened it, the slick dust-jacket smooth under my fingers. With no idea what I was looking for, I flipped through the pages, but found nothing that called to me. Eagerly, I picked it up and opened the cover, revealing a small, velvet-lined compartment containing a long, thin crystal the color of the sky. Recognition kicked me in the chest. A cool, damp feeling, like a pale echo of the ghost\u2019s touch, saturated me and then I was falling. Tears dampen her cheeks beneath her red-rimmed eyes. We\u2019d been exploring at the edge of the city. I\u2019d toppled. Fallen through the Boundary . . . I touch the necklace at my throat\u2014the thin, blue crystal she\u2019d given me for my fifteenth birthday. She leads me away from the thick fog that marks the Boundary.

It\u2019s that change\u2014that sense of nostalgia\u2014that was the genesis for Anchor and Key. I hope that you enjoyed the glimpse into a remembered past and a possible future yet to come.

The smell of leather and musty, aged paper is perfume to me. It puts me over the top. The older the book, well, the weaker I get in the knees. My shelves are heavy with 18th and 19th century publications, and whenever I\u2019m so inclined, I pull a book off the shelf and read a chapter or two on England\u2019s early efforts in colonial Asia or a verse or two from Shakespeare or Donne or Pope, and in doing so, I am transported back in time, my senses of sight, touch, and smell and a fertile imagination taking me there. There are two other products that make me swoon similarly: old sailboats out on the sea, and Apple hardware. While a wooden boat at sea affects perceptions in the same way, the MacBook Air, iPad, and iPhone lack the intoxicating aromas of old books and boats, their fragrances more RAMish, electrical and modern.

My undated Hodder & Stoughton edition of The Ruba\u2019iya\u2019t of Omar Khayyam has just a memory of a smell of storytime from thick soft volumes, while my copy of Elementary Particles by David Griffiths has an inexplicable faint whiff of black pepper. For a long time, every issue of National Geographic had a tangy smart pong that was the closest thing I\u2019d ever found to the taste left by a large bug (perhaps a bee) that slammed into the back of my mouth as I was cycling at speed. And nothing \u2013 nuh, thing \u2013 can match the overriding dusty-honey air of ancient foxed linen rag bond in the subterranean stacks of that Great Pyramid of theatre history, that glorious bibliotechnical Dumpster, the Harvard Theatre Collection. And so it was with pleasure that I opened a copy of Slanguage: A Dictionary of Irish Slang, sent to me by Stan Carey, a very fine man who lives in Galway, which is by the ocean on the shredded west edge of Ireland, and discovered that it has more to offer the nose than the Irish whiskey in my glass. Of course the book has myriads of fine words, and I will get to know many of them. But before I can read them, I have to open it, and at that moment it offers to my nose the air of where it had spent the past few years. It is not the fungus, humus, and mildew of a basement in Boston or Buffalo (familiar to me, to be sure) but a kind of smell that if it were a person would have a grey beard and long staff but a twinkling eye. It calls to mind a Cuban seaside hotel room, a Caribbean textile, a faint scent of betel nut candy, and \u2013 I think \u2013 a basement room I woke up in sometime in my childhood when we would take car trips all over the continent and stay in the homes of old friends of my parents first and last known to me in the span of a dozen hours. As I flip through this copy of Slanguage I get from the page gutters hints of iodine and maybe the rough wounded hand that had the iodine applied to it. I am inclined to think there must be a must of a bog or something of that order; Galway is a place of rocks and bogs and moss. It\u2019s not an old book, and it\u2019s not a warped or worn one either. But for me it has, in total, a smell as of a not-new room half into the ground that I awake in as the dawn slips through the flimsy blue curtains, and I turn my head on a pillow and roll my body in sheets I have not touched before last night and will not touch again in this life, in a town that I had never met before the day before, and I see the small shaggy rug on the slightly sweaty tile floor and I smell the dank that reminds me there is mycology in paradise too, and I can look forward to a breakfast with one more set of fresh almost-strangers, people like books I read the dust cover of once. But this book, its smell notwithstanding, is likely to be more like an old friend, returned to again and again to see a new leaf and another until I know some pages too well. This entry was posted in fun and tagged book sniffing note, Slanguage. Bookmark the permalink. It was, indeed, a relief to read this. I thought I was a little odd in my penchant for liking to breathe in the unique aroma of each book I read. You\u2019d give my 2yr old pet a run for her money. With a nose like yours, you should lend it to the wine or chocolate industry. This inspires me to pull some books long-forgotten off my shelf and give them a good sniff, to bring back the nostalgia of reading them for the first time. I tend to check out books from my library nowadays, and there\u2019s a bit of reluctance there to sniff them, as they\u2019re handled by numerous strangers who have also breathed directly onto the pages. So agree, like the warm slightly musty smell of old books and the ones like vanilla ice-cream. The smell is as important as the weight and feel of it. Now, I don\u2019t do it, probably because I am trying the smell the world that the books describe more ( i read a lot of fiction ). But not sniffing the dust of ages on the shelves. I know there are less of us simply because people like their screens now, but I still love the intoxication of opening an old book. Books are like wine the older they are the better they smell.

Lilacs summon smiles for many people. Soon the fragrance would overwhelm the house. For cousin, her grandmother had a light purple bush large enough that a mischievous child could hide in the middle of it and being surrounded by the smell of lilacs was heaven. With any luck, drying sheets could get wrapped around the poles and that night when you crawled into bed, the light perfume of lilacs was with you. Mom used to send it to us. Opening the box, that first inhalation of it and we zoomed straight back to childhood, to the local gas station, to picking out one candy to take home.

My 1950s era basement has such a strong musty smell that it can be noticed on the first floor. The house has a waterproofing system on the walls and floor, and there is no moisture anywhere that is visible. There are 2 floor drains, one used by the dehumidifier and a sump pump. had a friend who lived in the basement area of a very old house. and to keep the odor away, the vinegar needs to be replaced as needed. Editor's Note: To clarify, use plain barbecue charcoal, NOT the easy light kind with the lighter fluid in them. You need a dehumidifier to take the moisture out of the air. After a few days you will be amazed at the difference. Between the cellar door screen & the window screen you should receive some type of cross breeze thereby eliminating the musty smell. Plus a dehumidifier absolutely also helps. My aunt's basement has a very strong musty smell that is in the walls as well as the ceiling and beams. If it's possible open the windows in the basement to ventilate it so fresh air comes in. If you are going to do the job of taking care of the musty smell in the basement, make sure that you wear a face mask before you tackle a cleaning job. Use a mixture of bleach and water and scrub the walls. The bleach and water combination will get rid of the musty smell and mold. I don't know what can be done with the ceiling. What your aunt's basement needs is a dehumidifier which will remove the dampness. Maybe others will post some of their ideas. I agree with the idea of using bleach, but also trying using the product KILZ. How do you get rid of a musty smell in the basement? To rid the basement of musty smells use regular charcoal bricks. The kind used for grilling out. Do not use the ones with lighter fluid added to them. How do I get rid of a musty smell in the basement? Maybe a spray bottle, and set pans of it out. Definitely the dehumidifier though, otherwise the vinegar won't be able to keep up. A concrete floor must be able to breath or you will get mould and a musty smell. I have a walk-out cellar w/2 windows and a patio door. I ran it for a week straight which helped with the smell but almost doubled my light bill. It's the game room and doubles as a spare bedroom. If you ran it, windows are open and you still have that smell, then somehow water is getting in. Yes a ceiling fan would also help, but the best thing would be to find a source of where the moisture is coming from. My basement is 90% finished, but I still get a musty smell in it. You are going to have to find the source and repair it. There is a strong musty smell in my above ground and totally finished basement or lower level. I bought several large bags of charcoal (the kind used for grilling), opened them and placed them around the basement in different areas. The charcoal absorbs the odors and some of the dampness that causes the odor. If you like the smell of olives, then dust the basement area with olive leaf powder. Not only will OLP eliminate the musty smell, it will also keep any mold from forming. Use of a dehumidifier, along with the dusting of olive leaf powder, will do it. I have also used white vinegar left in bowls around the room. Spritzed the carpet as well. Could anyone tell me how to get a musty smell out of the basement?

If her wolf pack were here then they would help her up when she stumbles, lend her a hand and lead her to safety. Together. If her wolf pack were here then they would help her up, only to push her back down, harder, lend her a hand with a gentle smile and lead her to the edge of a cliff. They would watch with a wicked grin as she topples over, plummeting into the welcoming arms of death, down and down until her body hits the jagged rocks below, her bones splintered, her scarlet blood splattered onto the slick rocks. And then the ocean would do its work and the waves would wash her away, cleaning up the mess, already forgotten. The whispers giggle in her head, tiny claws sinking into her brain, poisoning it with a shade not quite black. However, the whispers are the only voices she has heard in days, and their invisible presence is a burden that lifts her up instead of weighing her down. The white wolf swivels her head in that direction. She hears the sound of snow crunching under paw or feet, and the soft, panicked breaths from her victim\u2026or are there more than one? A blur of animal skin darts away from the bush. The desperation for food gives her a burst of energy, and the wolf strikes. Aiming for the neck, her sharp claws piercing through the layers of leather and into its soft skin. She realizes that it was a young girl hiding behind the bush, now skewered by her claws, her screams echoing through the dark, silent night. The girl has silver hair that shines under the moonlight, shifting like the shadows. But what surprises the white wolf the most are the angry red scars covering the skin where her left eye used to be. The girl\u2019s friend, the other noise from the bush, manages to get away, desperately running and screaming back towards the village, already forgetting his dying friend. This is what friends do: They leave you behind and cast you out when you need them the most, the whispers giggle excitedly, Go on, finish the job! The wolf steels her heart, flicking away the silver of vulnerability that had claimed her earlier, then sinks her fangs in the soft flesh of the girl\u2019s neck. She feels the veins and arteries burst as she bites, the sweet, warm trickle of blood running into her mouth. She can\u2019t deny the satisfaction, the delicious smell of blood in the middle of ice. The white wolf watches as the girl\u2019s bright blue eyes go vacant, their luster dimmed. She is once again alone. Good. The white wolf then drags the body out of the woods, towards the village. Yessss, you did it. Now you can show them who is in control, the whispers say. The wolf grins, and the vengeful darkness in her heart churns, the chittering of the whispers louder, pushing her forward, as she takes step after step, each one closer to ultimate justice revenge. Once upon a time, a white wolf had a family, a lover, and a pack of friends. The white wolf stopped before the village, let go of the body in her mouth, tilted her head back and howled, long and great and filled with hatred and fury. Know she is the enemy, the beast let out of its cage. She is the White Wolf, and she is not afraid. Once upon a time, there was a little girl and a little boy who were best friends forever. The little girl once had golden hair and blue eyes before they took it from her, stole her left eye and gave her silver hair. The little boy was unmarked, smooth and beautiful and normal. They grew up together in a cozy village surrounded by the great forest in the South, and the unfathomable ocean in the North. They would always pretend to be magical hunters in the woods, running around, giggling with their sticks as swords, their stones as fireballs. On one unfortunate night, the girl and the boy were playing in the woods, but this time it was different, there was a colder chill in the air. Something was wrong. For a second, it seems as if their hoping had worked, but then the beast strikes, sinking its claws into the girl\u2019s chest, her screams piercing through the night. The attacker was a huge white wolf with a shining silver coat and one eye, it\u2019s vicious fangs gleaming under the moonlight. Out of terror and disbelief, the little boy got up and ran, too afraid to meet his friend\u2019s dying pleading gaze. Later that night, the wolf emerged from the forest, with the dead girl with silver hair and one eye in its jaws, its eyes two veiled storms of hatred and fury. The wolf drops the girl carelessly to the ground before the village, tilts it\u2019s head up and howled, long and great and filled with hatred and fury. Now the villagers know, know the white wolf who killed the monster marked girl. Now they will build a wall around the village, to keep the monsters out, and the children in. The reflection of a whole moon flickers and rolls on the glassy surface of the ocean, sifting with the gentle waves. The night is without stars, the utter blackness of night overwhelming. Dreary clouds drift lazily over the moon, leaving only the outline visible. Stray fragments of light peeking out from the clouds color the night a hazy gray. A lone wolf sits still on the rocky seashore, her glazed eye fixed on the hidden moon. Her silver coat gleams under the light, ever shifting in a million shades of gray. Deep inside her mind, darkness rises and pools on the clean white tiles of the floor. It is a dark liquid, not quite black, but in-between the shades of gray. The darkness slowly rises, the puddle quickly turning into a river, flooding the hallway. Rings of water expand on the surface as the whispers pound on the doors, their hushed voices taunting: Let us out! The doors quiver. The whispers chitter excitedly, waiting for the moment of release. The door splinters, the whispers are almost free. Their screaming overlap one another, the noise bounces off of the walls, every door in the hallway breaking, giving in to the whispers\u2019 demand. Meanwhile, the darkness flooding the hallway still rises, threatening to drown their screaming. The hallways are now filled with screeches, a mix of wailing and moaning and the anguished sound of suffering. The soundtrack of old memories meant buried deep in the hallways, lost with the turns and dead ends, sealed up tight with 3 doors and 13 locks, now reverberate off of the walls, roaming free in the hallways that were meant to keep them in. The whispers claw at their doors, screaming, crying, begging to come out. With a final crack, the doors burst and the whispers finally break free from their rooms, plunging into the cold darkness, free at last. Back on the seashore, the white wolf stays still. The waves creep slowly towards the rocky shoreline before running away, the water beating peacefully against the jagged rocks. The clouds pass over the moon, no longer obscuring it, and full moonlight shines on the water, awaking something deep inside. A low rumble shakes the shoreline, and the waves beat against the jagged rocks with crushing force, the rhythmic sound like drums of war pounding in the dead of night. A soft breeze shakes the white wolf\u2019s fur, and a long, low whistle travels through the wind. Voices rise from the black ocean, carried by the wind. Tears not quite black, but in-between the shades of gray, fill the white wolf\u2019s glazed eye, still fixed on the moon. Tendrils of darkness swirl inside the teardrop, and soft hisses vibrate from it. The tears drip from her snout and fall onto the rocks, bursting when they hit the ground, turning into a small puddle that has its own voice. They hiss and chitter, speaking nonsense or order, but whatever they are saying, it had caused the wolf to stir. She walks towards the ocean, closer and closer still. Her paws touch the water. The coldness seeps into her fur, leeching onto her bones, it\u2019s small claws gripping and stabbing, never planning to let go. The white wolf steps deeper into the ocean, eye still fixed on the luminous moon. The water rises to her chest, the voices and whispers screaming for her to go on. The water rises to her snout, to her unblinking eye. She goes under. And stays. The voices and whispers stop, the waves once again gentle, the moon less bright, the air still. The night resumes back to its hazy gray. Inside my mind, darkness rises and pools on the clean white tiles of the hallway. It is a dark liquid, not quite black, but in-between the shades of gray. It is ice, cold like the whispers that haunt you in your sleep, like the monsters hiding under your bed, like the vicious darkness within that waits with open jaws to swallow you whole. The darkness rises to my ankle, my knees, my waist, my shoulders, and finally it pushes me under. I try to swim up, but already I am drowning. The walls of the hallway disappear, replaced by an infinite blackness. I realized I am in the ocean and the waves are dragging me down, and the hands of darkness are claiming me and all the life boats are deflating and all the buoys are sinking and I can\u2019t swim and I won\u2019t swim I am sinking\u2026 I am dying in the never-ending hallway of my own mind, swept up in the chaos of darkness. Because they have bound my wrists and ankles together, threw me in the ocean to drown. I\u2019m a feature in the current, submerged until I\u2019m all gone. I often wonder this, sitting in the middle of my glass cage bubble with a porcelain mask over my face. But for most of the time, I am left alone with my thoughts, with the doubt and hatred creeping up, stepping out of the shadows when the sun goes down. Why do I always live in the fear of hurting myself when I break out? Because there is always a thief, a thief who will steal all the stars that light up your sky, until you are surrounded by darkness, forever alone. The whispers battle with their words, stabbing and hurting, waging war with the bit of light in my being. Today is the day, where I will not back down and I will not let the whispers empower me ever again. I pound and scream and kick for days, until I lose track, until my throat is parched and raw, hands red and bloody, feet swollen and oozing\u2026But I will not give up; I will break free. At last, the prison shatters, the glass that seemed so menacing and sharp, now a glittering confetti shower, catching the light from the setting sun. I breathe in and out, and step over the threshold. I don\u2019t see it through the glass, not ever again, but I see the truth. I try to take another step forward, to savor the precious moments of freedom, but I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t move, my feet stuck on the ground just outside of my prison. I claw to stay in the warmth of my conscious mind, my nails digging and scratching and finding purchase, but I lose my grip and plunge into the depths of my callous heart\u2026And then a burst of a blackness so dark and vicious jolts me awake, blowing up from my chest, and into the approaching night beyond. It was the darkness that saved me at the end. The darkness that is now part of the night, the shadows, the darkest corners of the universe. My mask shatters, falling from my face and breaking into a million pieces. They catch on fire as the sun disappears, the last bit of warmth fading away. I stand alone, with the shattered remains of my mask, the last embers winking out of existence. I look back at the prison that once held me in fear, now broken, the glass a harmless pile of confetti at my feet. Somewhere in the night, a white wolf howls, long and great and filled with joy. She is alone in the night, silver fur shifting with the shadows. She is alone, and free. Somewhere in the shadows, a darkness not quite black, but in-between the shades of gray, slithers down the rocky beach. The darkness slithers to meets the wailing ocean, calling for its lost child. It gingerly sinks in, finally, ultimately, returning home. Somewhere in one of the rooms in her mind, or a rusty metal cage 204 meters down, she is continuing to fill her paper with breathings of her heart. She is still fighting the whispers coming from the other rooms, banging on the doors to be let out, still trying to swim when the hallways are flooded. She is trying to be oblivious to her peer\u2019s protests about her writing. But she is trying. Trying to not hide the scars that make her beautiful, the vicious darkness within. She could be the weak little girl with silver hair and a lost eye, or the ferocious white wolf\u2014but she still doesn\u2019t know.", "hit_ratio": 6.88785046728972}, {"doc_text": "They show her what lies beneath her consciousness.

One clear star hung over the orchard and the fireflies were flitting over in Lover's Lane, in and out among the ferns and rustling boughs. But later on when they sat outside, smoking furiously to keep off the mosquitoes and watching the fireflies dart in and out amongst the trees, the boy was silent. A few fireflies flitted by us; and the solitary snipe, as it rose, uttered its plaintive cry. At these times the fireflies are seen flitting about from hedge to hedge. Into the night the sounds of luting flow; The west wind stirs amid the root-crop blue; While envious fireflies spoil the twinkling dew, And early wild-geese stem the dark Kin-ho. They seemed to swarm over the place all at once, till the lamplight, shining on their moving dark bodies and glittering, baleful eyes, made the place look like a bank of earth set with fireflies. True, he had beheld shooting stars (this in reply to Bassett's contention); but likewise had he beheld the phosphorescence of fungoid growths and rotten meat and fireflies on dark nights, and the flames of wood- fires and of blazing candle-nuts; yet what were flame and blaze and glow when they had flamed and blazed and glowed? The fireflies, too, which sparkled most vividly in the darkest places, now and then startled him, as one of uncommon brightness would stream across his path; and if, by chance, a huge blockhead of a beetle came winging his blundering flight against him, the poor varlet was ready to give up the ghost, with the idea that he was struck with a witch's token. Other fireflies quickly joined the party, syncing their flashes to their neighbors', until soon an entire swath of woods filled with undulating light.

When a fine mist rises at ground level, adding to the mystery and magic of the fey, blinking lights. Our fascination with lightning bugs supposedly ends when we learn the science behind the luminescence; the biology of why they blink and glow when other insects don\u2019t; and the reality that they aren\u2019t magic after all. At ages 22 and 24, Em and Jaye are grown-ups. Beyond the blacktop and the sparse grass of the side lawn, the cedars hold court. On humid summer nights I witness one daughter or the other pull up in her car, get out, pause, and scan the growing darkness, hoping for a glimpse of magic. According to Kristian Demary, a biologist with the Boston Museum of Science, most flashing species of fireflies in the Northeast come out between Memorial Day and Labor Day. We had to wait nine months to see if our wooded hilltop neighborhood had the right combination of trees, moisture and grassy areas to create the ideal habitat. I can\u2019t share the details of that first sighting because there were so many others through the days, weeks and months of firefly season. I remember that the woods behind the house came alive with pulses of light just at the moment it seemed too dark, too late to expect anything. The girls danced in the dim twilight, cupping their hands and swiping at flashes. Once I explained it was a smushed bug and that the glow wouldn\u2019t last, she grew somber and vowed not to hurt any others. We tried to be considerate jailers; we punched holes in the lid, placed a piece of damp paper towel at the bottom of the jar, added a handful of grass. Before we went inside and upstairs to bed, we always set them free. The first flakes of snow often delight us; but by the time we see three feet on the ground the charm has melted away. The girls and I could never get enough of that serendipitous, intermittent concert of pale color\u2014those pinpoints of light blossoming, then fading into the dark, all within the span of an hour. Firefly season seemed to grow shorter the older my daughters got. When Jaye went away to college, she emailed me a Pinterest link featuring faux fireflies in a jar. The instructions call for a clear glass vessel, three glow sticks and glitter. After snapping and activating the glow sticks, you snip off one end, squeeze the contents into a jar, add a touch of glitter, and voila! The end result as shown online looks too vivid not to have been Photoshopped, but it\u2019s a cruelty-free option worth exploring. Over the years, the backwoods have thinned. Others fell when new neighbors clear-cut their land to install an in-ground pool. Still more trees were lost when one property owner decided a lawn would look nicer than brushwood. Or maybe it\u2019s due to the dwindling firefly population, occurring not just in our neighborhood but around the world according to Firefly.org. Between the dense growth of myrtle, the decomposing logs hidden beneath their glossy leaves, and the cooler northern exposure, there\u2019s plenty of moisture and organic matter for the grub stage of the firefly\u2019s life cycle, which lasts up to two years. The fact that the flying insects only glow during the last two weeks of their lives makes their beauty even more poignant. I stand just at the edge of the trees, looking for twinkling bursts of light moving low to the ground or floating up into the trees. When I spot them, I call Em over to watch them with me, and Jaye, too, if she\u2019s home for a visit. Summer may be short, and firefly season even shorter, but as long as the fall of night is heralded by those darting, glowing creatures just outside my door, I continue to believe.

Their larvae emit light and often are called glowworms in Eurasia and elsewhere. In the Americas, glow worm also refers to the related Phengodidae. Fireflies tend to be brown and soft-bodied often with the elytra or front wings more leathery than those of other beetles. Although the females of some species are similar in appearance to males larviform females are found in many other firefly species. A few days after mating, a female lays her fertilized eggs on or just below the surface of the ground. The eggs hatch three to four weeks later and the larvae feed until the end of the summer. The larvae are commonly called glowworms. Some do this by burrowing underground while others find places on or under the bark of trees. After several weeks of feeding on other insects snails and worms they pupate for 1.0 to 2.5 weeks and emerge as adults.
